"We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!"
"As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.This movie could have been another Forest Gump, it could overly sentimental, instead, carries an appropriate amount of sincerity. The backstory is a major part of the movie. Doss is portrayed as uneasy with the girls who fell for the first pretty thing he saw. This could have been so Forest Gump-like but strikes a nice chord.The cast was excellent. Hugo Weaving was perfection. He carried the first half of the movie as the battle-fatigued (PTSD) WW1 vet father. Some may complain that the women are poorly portrayed as are the Japanese, who are largely like ants coming from their mound or canon fodder.As brutal as the second half is, I am sure it could not convey how truly gallant Doss was or brutal it was in reality."
"When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen."
"I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.I was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes I wasn't sure if this was a Mel Gibson film when I was placed into a comfort zone, with its melodrama set in a small Virginia town during the Forties, a schmaltzy romance, and the cliché violent drunken father who survived a brutal war. The performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue, but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling.By the 2nd act, I was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I at first felt was wrongly cast, but he really came through in the end). It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss' moral and internal conflict with using a gun! What he had to endure and stand-up for was a courage I greatly admired. It was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine. Maybe it was the introduction of Vince Vaughn's character. We all know how Vaughn is notorious in ad-libbing, and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well.Now the story had me in their pocket because by the 3rd act I was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of Hacksaw Ridge. You thought the horrific situation in WE WERE SOLDIERS was brutal, well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there. It was almost on par with the brilliance of GAME OF THRONES; BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS.Now I felt I was in a Mel Gibson film. As with Braveheart, the battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge didn't hold back. Maybe a notch better because of today's CGI (and I didn't even notice the effects!). The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish.The religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story, so as a non-believer I thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told, so it didn't bother me as much.Overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant, but then again I didn't really notice it because I was too distracted by the story and the characters, and when that occurs, I know the film has succeeded."
"Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers."
"Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller – the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror – these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans.The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince Vaughn's excellent turn as Doss' training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired, worn out by having experienced Doss' journey of hope, innocence, love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey."
"With its late release over here in England, by the time the film was released, it had already come to prominence with overwhelming reviews and 6 Oscar nominations to its name, so I entered with relatively high expectations, which I generally find to be a bad call as you tend to be let down, however Gibson's first directorial effort in a decade, 'Hacksaw Ridge', is a raw and emotional gut punch.With the history of cinema being littered with the production of World War II films, primarily in the form of over-the-top propaganda pictures such as 'Saving Private Ryan' (which nonetheless I still love), it's nice to see a movie that delves down the path of anti- war and focuses on the true-life tale of an uncaped superhero over fictional splendour, and 'Hacksaw Ridge' is just that. The film starts with rather over-sentimental, soap opera style tendencies which are occasionally funny to watch, but nonetheless they are perfect at delivering character development to our front-running hero Desmond Doss. I was initially expecting a 'Pearl Harbor' approach, with over an hour of lovey-dovey sentimental crap followed by under-accomplished action, but it was quite the opposite. The opening features the stated character development drama, but gives us an insight into Doss's personal reasons for his faith and religious approaches, then thrusts us into war.Now, the war scenes... well, let's just say they're some scenes I doubt I'll be forgetting anytime soon. They're epic, they're visceral, they're emotional, they're gory, but above all else, they are executed perfectly. Upon reaching the top of the Maeda Escarpment, nicknamed ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the squad are instantly driven into the horrors of war, the loss of friends and hope. The raw and visceral images are maybe even a little too realistic. Dead bodies are strewn across the ground, innards and entrails litter the floor, smoke and fire choke the landscape. This is war.'Hacksaw Ridge' is a hard-hitting film that if watched and truly understood, will be an unforgettable experience, and the concluding interviews with the real-life Doss add to the emotional core. The cinematography is stunning, the music is beautifully alluring and the performances, especially from Andrew Garfield, are beyond fantastic, Garfield completely embodies the persona of Doss with sheer accuracy. Further shoutouts to Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and the surprisingly brilliant Vince Vaughn. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films to have graced 2016... or 2017 here in the UK! We forgive you Gibson!"
"Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield's Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she'll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone's parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson's excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does."
"Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.The film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.Branded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.The heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film's merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.The most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film's Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero."
"I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion, the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.If you consider yourself a true patriot of America, this movie portrays YOUR values in a blessed light. For ONE gentlemen, amidst extremely adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his enemy to have save SO many men... is simply epic.I watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike. At no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war or add asinine political commentary. We all understood that soldiers fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of war is universal; even among soldiers."
"War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.The true life story of Desmond Doss is finally brought to the big screen, Doss was a US Army medic who served during WWII, but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of WWI (a veteran himself) it lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist, refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another. His personal choice would affect his country's army and persuaded a court hearing to charge Doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this, he is given the chance though to fight alongside his 'brothers' in the Battle of Okinawa, a battle which the American forces fought against the invading Japanese in an intense and brutal battle. It is here in this key battle that Doss was recognised as a true hero for his country, as he managed to rescue the lives of 75 soldiers wounded in battle.Gibson returns to the director's chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the 2 ½ running time. The first half of the film is about character and what establishes Doss to become a legend that he is known for, while the 2nd half of the film focuses on his role during the Battle of Okinawa and the brutal battle itself. The violence here is given so much detail, not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides. The production design, sound mixing, editing and scale of the battle is as intense, horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we've read in history books, but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to Saving Private Ryan's D-Day battle sequence. The 2nd half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout, but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film, though overall the film is emotional with Doss's back-story, his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that Doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield.In terms of acting, the cast as a whole is incredible with Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer giving the best key performances of the film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor, breaking away from his well known role as Spider-Man prior to HR. To describe his role as Doss, he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms. Garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role, as his character's journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart, emotion and bravery to make the journey of Doss so believable.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war, the bravery of Doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided. An incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for Oscar nominations and wins in 2017 (possibly for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Production Design, Music Score, Sound Mixing & Editing and Script) alongside other film awards. A must see film if you have studied history at school, have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that's true to its core. A masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will, we both highly recommend it.5/5 Autistic Reviewers"
"For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes but not this time.Although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as I would have liked, I realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. And truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. Mel managed to portray the man Doss so very well. Some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and I assure you that is not the message of it at all. However there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. He was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn't matter if you don't point yours in the same direction, you can't help but respect him for his courage, bravery, and unwavering faith. The movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of Hacksaw Ridge. It is both witty and endearing. Andrew Garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. He is a bit gawky and yet charming. His accent is true to the real Desmond, awkward though it is at times. He really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was, non-violent but a fighter just the same. It is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.Hugo Weaving masterfully plays Desmond's alcoholic dad, battling with his demons from WWI, and Rachel Griffiths plays his devoted Christian mother trying to hold them all together. Teresa Palmer plays Dorothy, a nurse that captures Desmond's heart. Sometimes cheesy, but then again in reality it would have been, and it is very amusing to watch. Teresa's Dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.Vince Vaughn plays the roll of Drill Sergeant Howell. He adds humour with his name calling, and humiliation of the soldiers, but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. Luke Bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private Smitty, the more traditional war story soldier.True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss's character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring it leaves ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the carnage on the hill, getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers Desmond sifts through looking for ""one more"" soul to save."
"Just when we thought all WWII stories have been told, this film offers an interesting story about a consciousness objector who chose to fight the system by serving in the military anyway as a medic. Mocked as a coward, he proves himself as one of the bravest in his unit. Critics here will state that it unrealistically depicted combat, but unfortunately this is Hollywood, which will use artistic licenses to promote a story. 
Brian Ghilliotti"
"I saw the movie with a number of friends this evening. Of the 10, 3 of us are combat veterans, with a total of 5 wars between us. (2 Vietnam, 2 Desert Storm and a current war in the Middle East veteran.) All the non-combat veterans thought the battle scenes were ""so horribly, so frighteningly realistic."" Those who have been to war thought they were incredibly cartoon-ish.The tactical mistakes such as bunching up, not seeking cover, bodies flying through the air, artillery explosions obviously gasoline, all the ridiculous yelling, were all so blatantly wrong. It was the worst depiction of battle we ever saw.If the Japanese occupied the top of the ""ridge"" why didn't they simply cut down the cargo netting the troops climbed? Why didn't they throw grenades down on the assembled Americans below? How did the cargo netting ever get there is US troops didn't already occupy the top of the mountain? Vince Vaughn was the Basic Training sergeant, again, best described as cartoon-ish. Peter Sellers as Inspector Cleuseau would have been more realistic.Quite frankly, there is nowhere enough space here to tell you how bad this movie really is.In reality, battle is hell, in some ways worse than what was shown on the screen, but in terms of realism, this movie is atrocious."
"Although we have only just nudged our way into February I nominate this as a contender for Worst Film of 2017. It might even win.This is a film of two halves. In fact the transition between one and the other is so abrupt that you could be forgiven for thinking you are watching two different films. The first half is comprised of two acts.Act 1 sees us in Disneyland with a saccharine sweet love story told as only the Americans can do with a plethora of sickly smiles, gleaming perfect white teeth, pretty pastel colours and every damn country boy and country girl cliché in the teenage book of dreamy heart fluttering romance.Act 2 Army training camp. New wet behind the ears recruits and a sergeant major set on making men of them. Familiar territory. You know the score: the recruits will be wheeled out fully formed and ready labelled from the casting department.. The tough one. The farmer boy one. The handsome one. The oddly short one. The goofy one. And the evil one who from the off sets out to make our hero's life a misery. And the signpost also tells you that an hour down the line in this film they will be best buddies. The sergeant major now does what all sergeant majors do in every boot camp film you have ever seen he yells and screams bawls and bellows just half an inch from the face of every recruit. Of course he saves the best of his decibels for our hapless hero.Turns out our hero doesn't want to carry a rifle he just wants to be a medic. So instead of congratulating him on this noble and potentially useful choice of army career he gets bawled out and they treat him like something the sergeant major scraped of the bottom of his size twelve boots.But with the help of his demented dad and his pretty and expertly permed smiling gal our hero escapes a court martial. The gal gives her guy a bible. We saw that coming. Part Two: Our hero and his buddies are gathered at the foot of a cliff. The only way up to Hacksaw Ridge is via a single wide rope ladder. Atop the ridge are approximately a quarter of a million Japanese soldiers. All is quiet. And you can't help wondering why those evil Nips (their term, not mine) haven't simply chopped down the rope ladder or why they are not massed along the top lobbing mortars and grenades down on the troops below.But we have been assured at the start of this epic masterpiece that we are watching a true story so we have to accept that this is how it happened. But that rope ladder still bothers me.However...the troops clamber up the ladder and they are on top of the cliff – and all hell breaks loose after a bombardment from some offshore guns.Now let me state here that I have read about the battles against the Japanese for control of the Pacific islands and am fully aware of the terrible fighting that ensued. The Japanese fought with suicidal recklessness not seen since Medieval times. But in this film that fighting is presented in such an orgiastic way with almost pornographic detail of spilled entrails, pools of glistening blood, severed limbs, decapitated heads, mangled half torsos and spaghetti shredded legs that the suspicion is that the director and writers have intentionally set out to out-gore every war film that has gone before. Every time a soldier looks up a bullet neatly penetrates his helmet and skull. Every time there is an explosion three men are catapulted into the air by some clever hidden device. And then there is more blood and guts and half- men screaming for their moms. The tidal wave of Japs overwhelms the US soldiers and miraculously they all escape down the one rope ladder. It's not shown how they get their wounded down there but hey ho... What of our hero...? Well he is still up top – now alone with the dead and wounded that have been left behind. A few Japs take some pot shots at him but then they all disappear back to their tunnels for some chow.Leaving our hero free to drag the wounded to the cliff edge. This is an heroic task in itself but now he has to get them to safety. He proceeds to lower them down the two hundred feet sheer cliff face. Actually there are only two blokes down there, smoking and chewing the fat. But they do a sterling job sending the wounded back to camp. Oddly no-one thinks to send a soldier or two – or twenty – up the trusty rope ladder to help our hero. They just hang around below waiting for the next dangling hospital candidate.And so it goes on. When our exhausted hero does eventually fling himself down with a rope there just happens to be scores of his buddies waiting for him. Shame they didn't have the balls to go up and help him. But they all line up cinematically so that our hero can be led away.At the risk of upsetting the 'Special Relationship' we have with our pilgrim brothers and sisters on the other side of the pond – and I know my fellow countrymen will understand this – Hacksaw Ridge is just too American. A much better script and a British director would have delivered a subtle, more sympathetic film with less of your usual jingoism and more of the real drama and nuances of war.This is a true story. A story of towering heroism. Real men fighting real battles. But in this mess of a film that story has been reduced to nothing more than a comic book reality. And all concerned deserved better than that."
"I begin my review by saying that I respect the history and the events that took place in WW2 and I have the utmost respect for the guys who gave their life for that cause. Having said that, let me tell you my opinion about the movie. And only the movie.Well, first of all I found it dull and uninteresting. The actors were fake. The scenes looked like rehearsals and uncut material. It was split in two half: the first was about nothing (well you could say stubbornness and stupidity because I was made to fell nothing for the main character except annoyed and uninterested) and the second about guts and gore. Did I said the actors looked FAKE? Oh, yeah. But man, oh man that was the main problem for me. The actors looked fake and the entire movie looked like a poorly made joke.The plot was something like this: let's establish the motives, good. Now the cause... good and now the effects. Perfect. Now we can move on. The audience got it. And so on and so forth. Now lets slip in some romance. You can't have a movie without romance. Good, check! Now let's be jerks about it and make his life uncomfortable in the army, check! But hey, he got beliefs, check! ONE BIG CHECK LIST. No emotion, no heart, no nothing. A dead flat feeling.Let me tell you few spoilers from the movie that I found to be really bad.the scene where he meets the guys from the army in the barrack. Why in the hell should you put a naked guy (no brains, just muscles) to do pull-ups naked? Why? Because the target audience appreciate it? Little girls can't watch a movie that has no naked buff guys in it? I can only imagine the guys who made that crap scene: OK, guys I have an idea! We will introduce a stupid character that will do pull-ups naked in the barrack. But why? Doesn't matter, but it will be very funny and in that way we please the target audience. And check that out. We will make him run naked outside the barrack because the sergeant wouldn't let him get dressed and he will be forced to run naked during their exercises. Ha ha, so funny, NOT!.the scene where they fight the Japanese. At some point the tough guy in the unit picks up a half dismembered body to use it as a shield and charged the battlefield killing 20 Japanese. WTF? At that point I was laughing and couldn't believe how bad this looks. Mel is becoming senile.another scene when some doctor got wounded and Dodds wanted to give him plasma and the doctor says ""No, give it to the other guy I don't know!"". And he did. After several minutes we see a scene where Dodds asks about the doctor and another guy says ""He didn't make it. He didn't have the plasma"". And he makes a stupid face and we as the audience understand everything. WOW that was very educating. It was explained to us like we were some retards and didn't understand the sacrifice he made. Very poorly done. Cheap.The battle looked like it was made by acrobats all jumping in spectacular ways, turning, twisting. All was about guts and gore. The more gore the better. Its as if the film was thought to get better with every gruesome scene over and over again. But it got worse. At some point after seeing so many body parts it became a joke. It began to fail and I was made to smile at how stupid this looks. Every scene made me think how the directors were scheming and constipating with ideas that were suppose to shock us until they run out of ideas and they just put more guts, gore and blood. That will shock them.I can continue to rant about this movie as every scene has flaws and doesn't deliver. I wouldn't call this movie an Oscar or even a mention. Mel's only good movie was Braveheart and I stand by that. I cant believe how easy people fall for this violence nonsense mixed with religion and patriotism. Could it be that this a recipe for successful movies? Or we are ashamed to admit this is a crap movie because we are afraid that others will look upon us and accuse us we don't respect history and heroes? Wake up people!"
"After reading many positive reviews here and elsewhere, I was eager to see this. But to my surprise this turned out to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. The first half is the cheesiest piece of Hollywood cinema in recent years and the second half contains the stupidest war action ever aside from comedy; it seemed like slapstick to me! I really have no clue how people can rate this highly. A total disaster of a movie!"
"""I have seen stalks of corn with better physiques."" Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) Director Mel Gibson is an action genius and along with that compliment, let's add he knows his violence. Hacksaw Ridge is a true and heroic story of the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor for bravery in battle. Brave also could be any attempt to separate the film from its controversial director, but I'll let the film speak for itself.The contradiction is real: Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a Seventh Day Adventist who not only refused to work on Saturdays, but he also refused even to touch a gun. Through the intervention at a court martial of his improbably brave and conflicted father (Hugo Weaving), Doss is allowed to serve as a medic under those conditions, proving to all that he could be braver saving men at Okinawa's Hacksaw Ridge than anyone else (75 men as a medic with a flair for ingenious rescuing).Although Director Gibson is best known for his graphic depictions of violence in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ, he can also be accused, along with writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, of clichéd story telling. The film's two parts, at home and at war, follow some pretty trite set-ups such as the mountain boy smitten by the nurse, the call to righteous service, the tough drill sergeant ( a terrific Vince Vaughn, see opening quote), and the sentimental trench dialogue.Yet these flaws work when the story needs them to establish Doss's kind heart, courage, and the essential goodness of fellow combatants as they confess they misread him and his conscientious objection. If you can forgive the almost unreal, lush setting for his youth in Lynchburg, Virginia, and his mooning for his future wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer), then you will enjoy seeing a real hero in a real war.Yes, Gibson knows how to depict action, not just pain, and it helps make Hacksaw Ridge a welcome addition to war films that tell true stories. And lest I forget, welcome back, Mel; you have been redeemed."
"This was a wonderful depiction of immense courage in the face of adversity--one of the most intensely moving films we've ever seen. My father was a Marine veteran of Okinawa and I personally really appreciate the research that went into making this great movie. He never shared much of his story with me while he was alive, and though my father didn't see combat in the battle depicted, this movie gave me many insights into what he saw when he was only 20 years old.There were many times during the movie that i was moved to the point of tears, and overall this was an emotionally gripping but yet still entertaining depiction of the horrors of war and the reality faced at Okinawa. HIghly highly recommended. Do not skip seeing this in theaters!"
"This story deserved better screenplay. The film tries to glorify the war where in reality it is very traumatic for soldiers of each side. But this movie tries to portray Japanese soldiers as zombies who don't have any feelings and they just want to kill or killed.
The movie ignores the reality like a plague. The US soldiers are marching forward without any cover. Japanese have dug trenches but Americans don't bother. They use a point to climb over the ridge etc.. The list goes on you get the idea.
I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be a disappointment."
"This is a sweet movie. It's very very sweet. In fact, it's so sweet that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen. And don't get fooled by the colors. This movie has a more black/white feel to it, heaven or hell, good or bad, etc etc.And I'm confused. Is this a political movie? I don't know anything about Mr Gibson's political views, but if this is it - I'm not buying.Is it a religious movie? If so, what is the message? That it's OK to go to war in the name of God?.I'm confused. So...what am I missing. Well, some nuances for starters! We have this clean-cut handsome James-Dean guy and his gorgeous sweetheart girlfriend (this is where the movie is sooo white and happy), and then we have this gruesome war where everything is very very black. And the Japs are evil. End of story. Is it that simple? Hmm...don't think so.This is a hard movie to rate. I give it 1/10 colorful nuances but a whooping 10/10 syrup bottles! And watch out - you might slip on the syrup floor on your way out from the theatre."
"I saw Hacksaw Ridge last night here's my opinion.... I don't know if that was supposed to be a historically accurate movie, since they had the actual veterans that they interviewed at the end of the movie But it was more like a Mel Gibson snuff film glorifying the act of killing people and some weird Christian stuff too. IF it was supposed to be a historically accurate movie they probably should drop the scene of a BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) gunner holding a limbless bloody human torso with one hand (like a shield) while running toward a Japanese position and firing the BAR with one hand. The most shocking part was that they stole the scene from Saving Private Ryan!! The Soldier's started throwing 60mm mortar rounds after bumping the bottom of the shells on their helmets. 😑 As if that was done on a regular basis. There were also several grenades having the pins pulled with teeth and lightly flicking them away. (FYI, if you try to do this in real life you will crack your teeth off). ....Followed by flamethrowers that were actually more like Dragon's breath, igniting dozens and dozens of Japanese soldiers. All this occurring on the screen with the audience behind me audibly saying "" Wow ""The actual cool part was when they showed the medic, heroically moving around the battlefield who ended up rescuing 75 men from Hacksaw Ridge. My one beef with this movie was that it is NOT A REALISTIC INTERPRETATION of what actually happened in WWII, in ANY sense This was more of a comedy/ glorifying gore... followed by actual interviews of real life veterans portrayed in the movie... WHICH, seemed to insinuate that everything you just watched was historically accurate. FAIL!!Also casting Vince Von to play a Sergeant 😑 with some opening scenes trying to mimic the full metal jacket humor, all of it.... epic fail and just hard to watch.On a scale of 1 to 10, the option of going to this movie or staying in my room and staring at the wall This was about a 2, and slightly better than staring at a wall..."
"I wonder what veterans of the battle had to say after watching this movie. There are many moments in this movie that make it look like Marvel's story. Unbelievable. Was there really only ONE rope ladder to climb for ALL American troops? Was there some kind of treaty with Japanese not to touch the ladder and let Americans climb till they reach the top and prepare for an attack? Everyone was just waiting for our hero to finish, ALONE,saving his wounded comrades? I used to respect Mel Gibson's work. Not anymore."
"Great graphics and high budget, of course. The standard boring music doesn't even matter, after you notice the big bad problem: there is no scenario, absolutely no intrigue or plot, nothing actually happens, there are no negative characters, there is no actual threat or problem to be solved, no twist, no surprise, nothing. So: boring. Predictable. Heroic. Anachronistic. Full of cliché-s. No plot whatsoever. Poor simple guy has small childhood trauma, grows up to be a fine man, goes to war, is a hero. Now, this might be a summary of a great movie; but in our case, it is everything you will find out in this one. There is, literally, nothing else. I am afraid of saying unrealistic as well, because the character was probably pretty much as depicted. Still, the portrayal is anachronistic, quite false. In fact, we have this huge powerful invading American army, smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic Japs (as expected) (no surprise here) (difficult to sympathize, but anyway, need to have some baddies around). And here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life, while his mates massacre their enemies all around, and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre, for a not-really clear reason. I mean, we love Gibson and he managed to do some great cliché heroic movies, so I was expecting more from this one. Just ain't."
"This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. When I thought it'd be just another Hollywood war movie about a typical war hero, it definitely surprised me, especially when it's faithful to the True story.I was amazed God is everywhere in this movie... in a Hollywood war movie? Wow.Half way through the movie, I understand that without explaining this soldier's strong Christian faith, this real story cannot be told. Without God, it would not have happened.** Might have spoilers below **Without God, a young man named Doss would not stick to the ""thou shall not kill"" commandment even in the bloodiest war zone. He would not have promised God that he would not touch a firearm in the first place, and then volunteered to serve along other soldiers at the front line against the Jap troops. Yes, at the front line without anything protecting himself except his bible and faith in God (you really have to see the movie to see what the bloody war was like).Without God, Doss would not have persevered even when he joined, when no one else understands/agrees with what he was doing, physically abused him, and almost put him into the war prison for disobeying the order to use a firearm. Many told him to give up and go home. He did not, even though he didn't fully understand why God calls him there. He persevered with his faith in God.Without God, when his comrades retreated at the Hacksaw Ridge in Japan, Doss would not have stayed, and had faith to re-enter the war zone ALONE and without firearm one time after another to save the wounded, while the Jap troops were everywhere hunting for them. By a simple prayer: ""Lord, please help me get one more."" He saved 75 soldiers (his comrades said it was actually close to a 100 when Doss modestly said 50, so they took the average)At the saving scene, I was so touched that I told my husband perhaps precisely because God didn't want to leave the wounded soldiers behind to die or to be captured, Doss has been called to be there. And not only that, what he did gave hope to his comrades for a comeback.Praise the Lord, for He must be behind all this.Thank you Mel Gibson and the production team because they were very faithful to the truth of this real story.----------I went to check some of the facts and wow they were mostly true, e.g. at historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/hacksaw-ridge/The real Desmond Doss considers it a _miracle_ that he made it off the ridge on Okinawa. ""His heroics didn't go unnoticed, as fellow soldiers were often amazed he was still alive."" - The Conscientious Objector Documentary""Doss doesn't hesitate to heal a man in need. He doesn't see skin colour, he doesn't see uniform, he doesn't see an enemy. This is a transcendent act and a rare thing to witness in our culture.""Final note: Let's not undermine the contribution of the other soldiers who fought and were injured/died at the battlefields, nor justify war itself, but this story of Doss opens up a whole new perspective that if you stick to what God really teaches, something incredible happens."
"I felt that this movie was a instant contender for best war movie when I watched it. Compared to Saving Private Ryan, it has definitely benefited from the technology of today's age. The story line itself was very inspirational and a heart warming experience that was moving from start to finish."
"It has been just a while since the movie released and I have already watched it three times. This movie is beautiful and emotional. Mel Gibson has made a perfect comeback and I do think, not appreciating his work and his film would be totally unfair. The score is the backbone to the film just like Braveheart. I really loved Rupert-Gregson Williams work and I would compare it to likes of Hans Zimmer and Late James Horner. The movie is more about a love story than War, instead this film actually condemns war. If the critics stop their hatred for Mel Gibson then this will certainly be Best Picture and will wind up the whole Academy Awards. Andrew Garfield's intense acting fuels the film and keeps you interested. The only problem that I found in the film was that a lot of actors had their accent, this I found quite minor and not notable. People complaining about the violence will be shocked to see how beautifully Mel has handled those scenes. I would compare it to Saving Private Ryan and I personally feel like I has an edge over Spielberg's Movie. I am myself a Jew and I don't like Mel Gibson for his Anti-Semitic attitude, but denying his art would be wrong. ****I LOVED IT****"
"Nominated for 6 Oscars. Really? I was really looking forward to seeing this movie although the story is already revealed in the trailer (and by the fact that it is a true story)I found it really cliché, mediocre and a waste of good actors that not gave a great performance at all. Garfield does an OK job, but I was definitely disappointed with Weaver and Griffiths.I watched the first half of the movie, the blooming love with the nurse, his training and shipping off to the battlefield. All so predictable and boring that I felt I could spend the last hour on more interesting things.I don't have much of an opinion on Mel Gibson. Braveheart was good, but I never saw The passion of Christ. If it is anything like this I will not bother.Don't do it. A waste of your two hours."
"I was looking forward to watching this film. I heard about Desmond Doss a pacifist war hero was awarded the Medal of Honor. I believed a great story could be told without having to go over the top. It must have been very strange for the other soldiers training and fighting with a man who held such strong beliefs against killing others. I expected the director to look at Mr Doss and his colleagues from a psychological point of view I was hoping to see something akin to Platoon. No! What we got was more akin to Captain America. In the hands of Mel Gibson, Desmond Doss was more of a cartoon character than a real hero. It was so over the top I was actually embarrassed. Now for a fictitious character this movie would be OK. It was well made, well acted, with lots of action. Mel sold this film base don Desmond Doss and then he failed to tell his story. Don't watch this film expecting anything special it is a generic American war film."
"""It was a scene straight out of hell. There is no other way to describe it."" This quote from Higa Tomiko, a survivor of the Battle of Okinawa when she was seven years old, may be the best description one can take away from ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the most recent World War II film directed by Mel Gibson in a stunning return to prominence among his Hollywood peers. It tells the story of Private Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to handle a weapon, but felt it was his moral duty to serve his country in a time of war when many of his friends and neighbors opted to do the same. It's a story of perseverance, courage and sheer fortitude, and one bound to affect even the most hardened viewer.In terms of battle imagery, this is probably the most relentless, bloody and vicious film yet, even more so than ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"". The absolute carnage on display is not for the faint of heart, and there are more than one scene that come out of nowhere to jar the viewer upright in your seat. Director Gibson even utilizes the technique in a civilian scene when Desmond Doss and his brother wind up fighting each other as kids, and Desmond uses a brick to lay out his sibling in a frightening scene, one that establishes Doss's very first insights about the morality of taking a person's life.I thought Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Desmond Doss was superb during the battle segment which dominated the latter part of the picture. Some of the boot camp scenes came across as somewhat unrealistic to me in as much as Doss seemed to defy his superiors with a smile on his face and sometimes without recrimination, although he did suffer the abuse of his fellow soldiers who thought he was a coward. Another element that seemed to defy logic was how the entire company of men from training wound up in Okinawa together, including the officers from boot camp. Not having been in the military, I don't know how that works, but it didn't seem that likely to me.Generally, I have a problem with war films that introduce a romantic element, however Desmond's relationship with future wife Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) is handled with careful restraint. The interruption of Desmond's father (Hugo Weaving) at the military court martial proceedings was another one of those elements that seemed to defy credibility, so that's one I'll have to research.Because of the film's central focus on Desmond Doss and his heroic actions at Hacksaw Ridge, one might be tempted to believe that this was the only battle he participated in. In fact, Doss also served in the Pacific Theater in the battle campaigns of Guam and Leyte Gulf, earning an entire host of citations for his bravery, including the Medal of Honor. Totally unexpected, but a very welcome conclusion to the picture had clips of the real life Desmond Doss speaking to his experience during the war prior to his death in 2006. Stills of the young Doss bear a remarkable likeness to the actor who portrayed him, thereby adding a further sense of realism to the story in retrospect. Over all, the movie is a remarkable tribute to a man who held a deep conviction and commitment to a higher power while stating ""I figure I'll be savin' people, not killin'."""
"This was by far the best picture of the year and a great comeback for Mel Gibson. It didn't win best picture because of the politicization of the Oscars. No way that ""Moonlight"" even came close to this film. To win an Oscar now you have to be non-white and LGBT. It reminds me of how ""Saving Private Ryan"" lost to a ho-hum movie ""Shakespeare in Love."" People still watch SPR but who ever talks about the other movie. So I predict that Hacksaw Ridge will become a classic while the other movies is well forgotten. Hacksaw Ridge, on the other hand, is a story that is so unbelievable because it stretches all credibility but hits us in the face because it actually happened. One of those ""no one would believe it if they made a movie"" but it actually happened. The courage of that man going alone, unarmed, except for his faith in God, directly into the mouth of hell. I am not a Christian but the devotional aspect of this movie was very inspiring. I would recommend anyone to see this movie and forget the other movie."
This movie is awful. If you like believability don't watch this 120 pound guy carry guys twice his weight while being shot at. He's kicking grenades like a ninja. It is not a good movie at all and I would say Vince Vaughn was a terrible choice as his Sargent. This is a highly overrated film that isn't worth the time to watch it.
"Hacksaw Ridge is ultimately a good film made about a great story that squanders much of its potential with wooden dialogue, countless clichés, and telegraphed punches rather than foreshadowing.When I saw the movie, I didn't know much about it and somehow missed in the opening credits that it was directed by Mel Gibson, but as I watched, I remember repeatedly saying to myself, ""Man, someone has a persecution complex."" Doss' pacifism was a central theme; it was so integral to the plot, that nobody could have missed it if it had not been treated so heavy-handedly. This would have been much better if it had been a war movie in which the protagonist takes a philosophical stand, rather than a movie about a man being persecuted for his beliefs (often fairly) with the war going on as a sub-plot and vehicle for it.The grisly violence portrayed in the war scenes failed to create the atmosphere of a battlefield in the same way that better directed movies did; the reliance on graphic violence served to highlight the lack of tension and fear that should have been palpable, as we've been given in Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan, for that matter.Still, the backbone of truth in the story is strong enough to overcome many of the film's shortcomings. Though most of the characters were just cartoon sketches of real people (many of them pretty cheesy), they were hard not to like... especially Doss himself, and his broken father."
"Mel Gibson proved again that he is a magnificiant director, 'Hacksaw Ridge' in my opinion one of the best War movies I ever seen. ""To believe in God is to believe in humanity.To believe in humanity is to believe in God"".Starting with this quote I'm focusing now on the story of Desmond Doss,who served as an army medic in Okinawa war, a greatest hero that saved a lot of lifes without firing a bullet. President of the US gives to Doss the Medal of Honor in October 12,1945. The story clearly illustrates that the only weapon can be faith and pure love for life,combining with a remarkable dose of courage.I have to mention about the injustice born of inability and deep understanding,when soldier Doss in the training camp was one step away to face the martial court because he didn't want to use a gun,a crucial moment which eventually solved well,I was glad and relieved when his father came with the 'saving' letter from the general. Great actors,wonderful effects and a very emotionant scenery that makes your heart trembling,from the beginning to the extraordinary end. This film is worthy of respect."
"It's truly maddening that IMDb's rules demand a minimum of one star to be awarded to any movie; there should be a special clause put in place, just for over-hyped monstrosities like Hacksaw Ridge. Safe to say, if I were given the chance, I wouldn't be gracing this ode to racism and gender inequality snuff movie with one iota of a merit. So many things have gone wrong here that I think there is a need for a whole new set of words invented to accurately describe it. Of course, knowing the director, this has probably been a pretty accurate depiction of his directorial vision and overall cosmotheory. No words -- but in rage, I'll still try.A droll, all-American, penis-waving, religious propaganda failing on so many levels -- and so many levels past, that you could quite realistically read any random negative review on it and you'll know exactly how I feel. That is all.As a sidenote, and with all its fundamental, genuinely offensive issues set to the margins, Garfield has the on-screen charisma of a constipated caterpillar."
"No matter what you think about Gibson, and I don't think much of him as a man. He is an elite director. There is a unique genius in how he handles this film. I hope this does not constitute spoilers, I don't think it really does, but the battlefield scenes are the most harrowing I have ever seen. There is nothing left to the imagination with shock after visceral shock coming at you for a good twenty minutes. The effect is an adrenaline surge as you feel like you are trying to survive with Doss and the rest of his troop. The payoff occurs after Doss does what he does and comes off Hacksaw Ridge. It is so emotional. The effect is amazing and it is all steered by Gibson's intense direction. You may even think, oh God, this is just too much, as you are watching the battles unfold, but it all results in a unique payoff.I like Garfield . He is a bit too goofy at the start and I feel like his hairdo makes him look more like the lead guitarist from the Spiders From Mars than a WWII hero. But once he gets in uniform his character really develops. Vince Vaughn seemed to love chewing the scenery as the Sarge, and Teresa Palmer was also solid.As an agnostic, there was one scene at the end that I felt was a little over the top, but the religious angle is handled beautifully and the power of faith is a great lesson for anyone. This is going to be a real crowd pleaser, but it is decidedly not a family film despite the theme. It is the most violent film that I have ever seen."
"Quite a few critics in the UK have panned this film as ""schmaltzy"" or a ""pastiche"" of warfare films. Ignore them. Bottom line is - the story is fairly slow to get going. It's too slow to get through the back-story of his early life and only gets going after Doss arrives at Fort Jackson for basic training. From that moment on, the film starts to build up to what this is really all about - how he won the Medal of Honor (which is not a spoiler). When they get to Hacksaw Ridge, there's 5-6 minutes of warfare gore that is totally full-on. Rightly so - it's disrespectful to those that served and died to depict their sacrifice and experience as anything other than unbelievably awful. Then, just sit back and watch what Doss did next. It's an inspiring story. Can't believe I've never heard of this inspirational story of courage before now. Watch it and be prepared to shed a tear."
"Mel Gibson returns behind the camera a full 10 years after his last directorial outing in Apocalypto (2006). Mel Gibson has proved to be a master when it comes to direction particularly when he is constructing a battle scene. However, being a full 21 years after Braveheart (1995) I myself was a little worried that Gibson had gotten a little rusty. Regardless of this, when I heard he was going to direct another war film I was very excited to see him back behind the camera. But the question remains. Has Gibson lost a step in his 10 year hiatus from directing? The answer is NO. Mel Gibson has proved that he has perfected his craft and in my opinion he is the best when it comes to crafting a battle sequence. The action is gritty, violent, realistic and most of all, it is absolutely terrifying. The battles in this film resemble a horror movie and a few times I even jumped. The intensity is constantly cranked up to 100% through out the second half of the film. Notice that I said 2nd half, that is because through out the 1st half this film is about the Character of Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spiderman, 99 Homes), struggling to stay true to his beliefs and attempting to prove to his peers that he is no coward. There is also a very heartfelt love story between Doss and his girlfriend Dorothy, played by Teresa Palmer (Lights Out), their relationship in no way feels forced and feels very authentic. I was very shocked when during the first hour there was little to no violence considering this was a Mel Gibson picture, but don't make the mistake of thinking he is only skilled at directing battle scenes because the character build up portrayed by Gibson is enthralling and allows you to invest in the characters as actual people so you care about them when it all goes down. So all in all, Gibson has proved that he is without a doubt one of the top 5 directors working today and he has no doubt earned, in my opinion, an Oscar nomination for Best Director.The acting in this movie was something I worried about and again, I was proved so wrong. Everyone gives an outstanding performance most notably, Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, V for Vendetta), Luke Bracey (Point Break, The November Man) and Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers, The Lost World). Andrew Garfield proves that he is more than just Spider-Man and he deserves the Oscar for Best Actor or at least a nomination. I have no doubt that he will win several awards and more importantly, his performance will go down as one of the best in recent memory and he truly blew me away. Luke Bracey gives the most surprising performance I have seen this year, maybe not an Oscar worthy performance but definitely a good, solid performance as a soldier fighting alongside Doss. Hugo Weaving gives maybe the best performance of his since The Matrix and is a possible candidate for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Doss' abusive, drunk father after serving in WWI.Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer and really all others involved give great supporting Performances.I can safely say Hacksaw Ridge is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan with brutal, terrifying battle sequences, beautiful cinematography, and incredible performances. Hacksaw Ridge deserves multiple Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture. This will go down as a classic and one of the best war films of all time and I strongly recommended you go see this in theaters ASAP. 10/10"
"""A single man, driven by faith endures all possible torments without giving up hope."" I think this works quite well for most of Mel Gibson's films from ""Braveheart"" (1995) to ""The Passion of the Christ"" (2004) and the brilliant ""Apocalypto"" (2006). ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is no exception telling the story of another man of faith and determination, a man who ""sticked to his guns"" however this idiom sounds particularly ironic in this case because the man in question, corporal and U.S army medic Desmond Doss achieved military glory while being a conscientious objector that refused to carry or even touch a gun or any other weapon.""Hacksaw Ridge"" is structured like many army and war films. The warm prewar life (here however haunted by a complex relationship with Mr.Doss Sr.) Second act is the obligatory Boot Camp scene with the always enjoyable routine barrack inspection and training chin deep in the mud. Third (and fourth) act is the lengthy battle chapter in which Gibson almost revels in a gory dance of torn limbs and fire and smoke pyrotechnics. What makes the difference is Doss, the atypical hero, lanky and a bit goofy, but whose courage is not simply innate but fuelled by his compassion his sense of duty and his unflattering faith. If you think about it this definition works for most of Mel Gibson's films."
"Let me start by saying that the true story of Desmond T Doss is nothing short of incredible! What an amazing individual he must have been!This film however, is absolutely dreadful!! I cannot comprehend how it's getting such great reviews. I can get over the fact that Spider- Man is trying to play the role of a real-life war hero. I cannot get over Vince Vaughn and his painfully bad attempt at playing the part of a drill sergeant. I love Vince Vaughn but this performance is awkward at the very best. Completely unconvincing in his portrayal of a soldier and drill sergeant.Let's move on to accuracy in film... There is none. I mean none WHATSOEVER! The uniforms and equipment look very bargain basement which is disappointing considering the films 40 million dollar budget. The way military life and combat were depicted place this film in the same realm as Starship Troopers and early John Wayne films. With movies like Braveheart and Apocalypto under his belt, I expected so much more from Gibson in the directing of this movie. In past works, he conveyed so much emotion and passion that you almost couldn't help but be swept up in the story. Hacksaw Ridge, however, pays no attention to detail. The scripting was uninspired, unconvincing and completely unrealistic. I understand that no film could ever live up to the real-life heroism of Desmond Doss. But the attempt could have, and SHOULD have been much better! It makes me cringe to think that all some people will ever know of his awe-inspiring life, is what they saw in this shameful piece of film making."
"Just a couple of minor comments that I don't consider spoilers, but you know how it is.The comment made by my wife as we left the theater today - both of us with shed and unshed tears in our eyes - was simple. ""What a story of commitment, and of faith."" That's what's been missing in what's coming out of Hollywood for so long.That's what this boils down to. Desmond Doss made a commitment to God to not shed blood, to not kill, to never use a gun in anger. And when we see his childhood and the other events, you can understand it. But when the Japanese attacked the U.S., he felt the same surge of patriotism as everyone else. He could have taken a pass, but he didn't feel right in staying home. He says in the movie that two guys from his home were found to be 4F and killed themselves from shame. So he didn't feel right in not going.This is an extremely violent movie, extremely graphic. That's the reality of war. You get to know people during the basic training sequence, and then watch them die. Horrifically. Yet due to his actions, Desmond saved so many more that would have died otherwise. Anyone who complains that the Vince Vaughn drill sergeant is a ripoff of Full Metal Jacket has apparently never served in the military. That was also reality.This movie will stick with you. People say it's racist against Japanese. That's ALSO how it was then. People will say it's too violent. That's the reality of war. What they miss is that it's also the journey of a man who made his relationship with God, made a promise to God, and kept that promise. ""One more, God, let me get one more."" Hands destroyed from rope burns, exhausted, beaten and battered. ""One more, God, let me get one more."""
"Did I see the same movie as everyone else? An 8.2 rating for this holier than thou, self righteous yawnfest? Movies like these make Slaughtered Vomit Dolls look like Oscar material. Never in my life have I ever seen a movie as manipulative as this nonsense. Flooded with scenes that could make a grown man hurl, this unrealistic claptrap of a film is only worth viewing once, and of course, that's for the intense and magnificently- rendered violence you can always count on Brother Mel to produce.I guess there were just too many scenes that were pilfered from other movies that made me groan. The influence of Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, and especially, Full Metal Jacket, were WAY too obvious. Would it have killed Brother Mel to not portray the Japanese as one-dimensional, blood thirsty conquistadors? Left a bad taste in my mouth. Hacksaw Ridge. Sigh. A film only Donald Trump supporters could love."
"Having just watched 'Hacksaw Ridge', and then immediately after the 2002 bio-doc about Desmond T. Doss's life, I can easily understand why Mel Gibson needed to give this story the Hollywood treatment. After a little research, almost unbelievably, this 'myth-making' Gibson movie turns out to be an accurate portrayal of the man, and a pretty accurate account of history. The movie isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn good. What affects the viewer more than the brutal violence of war on display, more than the performances of the cast, more than Gibson's direction, is the unflinching determination, unselfish bravery, compassion and faith the real Desmond Doss showed throughout his life. What a character.Hats off to Desmond. A fine human being and an example to us all.Everyone should know his story.11/10 for the man. 8/10 for the movie."
"What the hell did I watch? Was it some kind of an anti-war movie or, in a so called way, a real story conventionally narrated as a sentimental war-hero movie? Someone must speak about that; it does not matter if you use a gun, or kill someone or not, if you have that kind of a mind, set to war, heroism, and nearly fascism with an unsurprisingly weird attitude towards Japanese.You know what? This movie is just a way to arouse perilous feelings which are tamed by education and reason. It is filled with Christianity, bible, common scenes, and unbelievable, unreliable screen writing intermingled with Mel Gibson's directing. By the way, it was not just a slap, he also kicked the grenade, didn't he?"
Probably the most comical fairy tale that some kid could comprehend on world war 2. Entire movie seems like a 5 year old comic book. There are scenarios shown in the movie which any sane mind would recognize as pure crap. My question is how is that this movie ended up with 8+ rating while many clearly better movies ended up beneath this load of crap. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS NO WAY DISREGARDING THE HEROISM OF THE WAR HERO DEPICTED IN THE MOVIE BUT CLEARLY IN THE WAY MOVIE IS CREATED.The next time you try to create a captain America sequel try not to confuse it with historical wars.
"Gibson is back. And gave the world a new violent reli-movie. If you like to see all Hollywood cliché: go see this one. More white people fighting foreign people! More suffering! This time on a cartoon battlefield with rats on every body, people flying around everywhere and more goofy horror-style gore. In the end, Christianity will win over those savages. I'm not even looking at the plot holes, the historical falsifications and the military fairy tale that's being shown here. Really, just one rope ladder for the whole invasion? And the Japs didn't cut it loose?The most scary thing is that it seems like the majority of the people take this film VERY serious. It even got nominated for six Oscars, praised here in IMDb as the best, realistic war movie ever. Let me tell you: it's not. It's a new genre movie, especially made for white males with a narrow and religious view on the real world and it's history."
"Everything bad everyone else said I guess. Just so contrived and formulaic and unrealistic. I just don't understand the positive reviews . . . Does IMDB get kick backs or something? Technically, it's flawless in it's image and sound quality but wow, couldn't they have listened to the military consultants I know they must have hired? The younger brother comes to the breakfast table and says ""I'm going to enlist"" or words to that effect, and he, lol, is, hilariously, already in uniform. They used every cliche from every war movie from the last twenty years - I found it cringe worthy. Not to diminish what Desmond Doss accomplished but dang, they really missed an opportunity to do it justice . . . too bad."
"The movie is full of romance, patriotism, drama and emotion. I enjoyed the movie a lot. I am very glad to here that it won awards in several events and those were totally perfect for it. None will be unhappy watching the movie. It inspires us to love country and work for country. I'm fallen in love with this very movie. Thank you the movie producers, actors and others for presenting such an inspirational movie to us."
"The True Story of Desmond Doss is incredible. It's a story that genuinely deserves a wider audience. However what Mel Gibson does, is create a misty eyed, all American first act; and a second act that concentrates more on jump scares and gore than actual crafted, intelligent film-making. This could have been epic. But it wasn't. It was full of lazy romanticism, war clichés, absolutely awful dialogue and Vince Vaughn. It's such a shame because it truly is an incredible tale. But when you hear the likes of:""You gotta be kiddin' me""; ""We gat company!""; ""Let's go to work boys""And other such tired dialogue it rather ruins any tension or seriousness of the fraught situation we've just experienced. Some of the goofy lines and sequences were close to feeling that they were actually parodying other war movies. The end battle sequence is also ridiculous, and yes I know Desmond Doss really kicked a grenade out of the way in battle but this does not mean that the way Mel Gibson recreated it (which looked like a 'slo-mo' of a Soccer player scoring a goal in the world cup Final) was in any way captivating or entertaining and actually just made me laugh out loud. As did several other bits. It could have been such a delve into one of the most remarkable men to ever go to war. Instead it just resembled Captain America in a US Army uniform for an hour. Despite some nice photography it is a wasted opportunity. Lovers of Michael Bay and/or superhero flicks may like this movie. I didn't. 5/10"
Stop overrating because you were born in America. This does not contain any spoilers. There are a few scenes that are not medically correct so if you spend over 30 million dollars at least hire some good doctors to review what you are doing.
"George Clooney said you can make a bad film out of a good script but you can't make a good film out of a bad script. How could this film be nominated for best film but not be nominated in the screenplay category (Titanic anyone?). I really wanted to watch this in the cinema and didn't. I made the mistake of buying it on DVD without checking which oscars it was nominated for and now a part of me wished I hadn't.It isn't by any means a terrible film but I didn't feel emotionally involved with the characters not in the same way as I did with ""Saving Private Ryan""."
"With more than 600 reviewer comments in October 2017, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" doesn't need any more reviews. But, I should weigh in on a couple of points – about the film and its reception. First, the film. I congratulate Mel Gibson for tackling historic subjects in his films. We have far too little of that in the 21st century, yet there is so much modern society can learn from the past. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't seem very interested in telling the stories of heroes and heroics of saints and sinners. In this case, a little known hero, Desmond Doss, is the first conscientious objector in U.S. history to receive the Medal of Honor. Gibson took a 2004 documentary and made an outstanding film about a true hero. My bone to pick with the film is its Computer-generated Imagery. I realize it's nearly impossible in the 21st century to make a war film set just about anywhere during World War II. The places just aren't there to shoot anymore. Nor is there sufficient remaining equipment, machines, vehicles and other materials of the time and period. So, for much of the shelling and action of this film, CGI was necessary. It wouldn't have been so noticeably CGI if Mel Gibson hadn't want to be so graphic with bullets ripping through bodies, legs being blown off, etc. There is so much of that in this film, and it appears so crisp and clear as to be unbelievable, unreal. Our human eyes don't see things most of the time nearly as sharp and clearly defined as CGI presents them. I might have given this a pass except for a few scenes that were so clearly phony. Body parts or other objects from explosions are flung into the air in all directions. Several instances are so obvious drawn or created images with flames coming off of them as they fly rather slowly through the air. It's clear to me that the technical and creative people don't have CGI down pat or perfected yet. There's just too much of this in the film that one can't help be aware of it, so that knocks the film down from 10 stars to nine. The second point related to the film is the Academy Awards and other 2017 recognition paid by the members of the film industry. Desmond Doss was an Army medic who served in the Pacific theater during World War II. The full story of his heroism is much more impressive even than this film shows. Andrew Garfield gives a tremendous performance as Doss. This is truly great acting – which the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTA awards are supposed to recognize. I haven't seen all of the movies with the nominees for best actor, but I did see most. I can't imagine what politics or other things may be at play. That Garfield didn't win the best actor is a true shame on all of the industry groups. I have nothing against Casey Affleck, but his role in ""Manchester by the Sea"" had the least demands for acting of any of the nominees. It can't hold a candle to Garfield's performance in ""Hacksaw Ridge."" Again, Hollywood and the industry seem to thrive more on personal popularity, looks or some other criteria."
"This movie was very different from any other typical war movie. The bravery and stupidity shown by the main character (Andrew Garfield) was remarkably moving, with running into a war-zone with no weapon of any sort to defend himself. Instead of weapons only having a medical kit and fierce determination to save every life he could. If it wasn't for the clichè and very slow start to the movie where he found love before going to war, I would have given this movie a 9 or 10. In saying this, it was a huge step up for Andrew's acting career in comparison to mediocre movies like Amazing Spiderman 1 & 2.Overall, I would highly recommend seeing Hacksaw Ridge, it truly is another Mel Gibson masterpiece. Just try not to be deterred from the slow start as it will have you on the edge of your seat by the end and close to tears."
lets just say Mel never disappoints when he is in the directors chair. great story line and the action scene showed that there was great attention paid to detail. Reminded me of the shore scene in Saving Private Ryan. Great performance from the actors. Its not a movie you wanna watch over and over but it will surely keep you on the edge of your seat when actually do watch it for the first time. Two thumbs up.
"Based on the true story of an army medic who insisted on never carrying a weapon, 'Hacksaw Ridge' tells a slice of World War II history that dares to redefine traditional notions of bravery. The graphic battle scenes are very well done with Gibson never shying away from the severity of battle wounds and how precious life in war is. For all is virtues though, the film often feels preachy with the protagonist's religion-motivated pacifism (and how this repulses everyone in the army) repeatedly brought up. A formulaic romance also weighs against the film and some of the casting is downright odd, with Vince Vaughn especially awkward as a drill sergeant who is hardly fearsome and seldom angry. The casting of Hugo Weaving as the medic's father is a stroke of genius though with Weaving stealing every scene as a former war veteran plagued by inner demons and horrific memories of World War I. Andrew Garfield is fine in the lead role, though against 'The Social Network', '99 Homes' and others, it is hardly his best work. Overall, this is an easy to film to recommend for those keen on unflinchingly realistic battle scenes and detailed insights into military bureaucracy. It is hardly a flawless film and perhaps a little message-heavy for its own good, however, it says quite a lot that the movie manages to pack a punch even when one knows about his heroism to come."
"We saw this at home on DVD from our public library. Sound and picture are exceptional, I have a good powered subwoofer, at key scenes the whole room was pulsating with the explosions. Mel Gibson directed, one of his sons is a key character.This is essentially the true, accurate story of Desmond Doss. As a young man in the early 1940s he felt a great obligation to join the Army and fight for his country. But he was a religious young man and had decided that he would never take up a weapon, a gun or rifle, under any circumstances. But he would instead become a medic, one who would go in battle and help the wounded survive.Much of the first half of the movie involves his early life, his meeting the pretty nurse he would eventually marry, his difficulties during basic training when they tried to break him to receive a discharge. They didn't want a coward in their unit, unaware that Doss was probably the bravest of the bunch.Most of the second half involves the battle against the Japanese on Okinawa, particularly the effort to take Hacksaw Ridge. The Americans were ambushed, there were many casualties, the healthy retreated down the rope ladder on the ridge. But Doss all night looked for wounded, dragged or carried them to the ridge, lowered them down. Through the night he saved about 75 men that way, when morning came the officers were amazed, ""Where did all these come from?"" British actor Andrew Garfield is really good as Desmond Doss. The movie was filmed mostly in Australia, a favorite place of Director Gibson's, and features mostly Australian actors. In fact the only American actor I am sur4e of is Vince Vaughn.All-N-all a fine movie but often difficult to watch for the realistic depiction of the savagery and gore of infantry war. Clips of the real Doss are shown at the end."
"Hacksaw ridge is by far Mel Gibson's best movie as director; it had all the criteria for it to be this year's best picture. It is a calm journey through the life of a simple yet unstable southern family; it brought us to admire the simplest joys of life, the happy and loving daily life of the American suburban families before the war. This movie showed us the true meaning of love and compassion and restored our hope in humanity. And then as expected gave us its obscure side, throwing us in the most well directed and performed war decors ever filmed, a true human carnage between the seemingly weak American army and the ruthless Japanese battalions. Hacksaw ridge is a story of pain and suffering and war, but it also represents the eternal fight between good and evil, and by that not meaning the two armies themselves but the true battle between faith and despair. Hacksaw ridge is truly a modern odyssey. One of the most crucial elements of such an amazing quest is the protagonist Desmond doss, a man of iron will and unbreakable faith who tried to save humanity in my opinion from violence and war. Portraying such a persona is undoubtedly a great challenge, and Andrew Garfield was up to it: The young actor exhibited with the help of the industry's veteran Mel Gibson one of the most sincere performances in the history of war films, his great acting skills were a key element to the success of this picture. The character of private doss was itself a fascinating trait that contributed to the critical acclamation this picture had received, he is as Andrew Garfield perfectly fits a man of a poor physique yet of great courage and altruism, his a medic that dived head first into the hordes of dead in the battlefield without hesitation, he is a loving husband, a great son and a true patriot who stood willingly in the face of the dreadful war in japan in order to save his fellow brothers in arms. In this dire times , the only one who truly stood by the side of private doss was his father Thomas , a good turned cruel man that lived to tell about the war to end all wars, he was disturbed and traumatised , something that Hugo weaving mastered on screen , he was such a great cast choice and delivered more than what was needed from a secondary character, he visualized in every move he did and every word he spoke the true horrors of war, he was all the time dark and shocked demonstrating what a war could do to a country, a family and a man. To sum it up, hacksaw ridge is definitely a must watch, it's by far one of this year's most exciting and overwhelming pictures. It is a top notch movie that depicts unprecedentedly the march of one man to end a war, it's the story of a real war hero who chose not to take the life of his brethren, and it's a movie for the director Mel Gibson to be proud of."
"Impressive performances all around and Andrew Garfield is surprisingly very effective and who the hell ever saw Spider-Man suiting up as an army medic carrying wounded soldiers overnight?.Hacksaw Ridge's detailed gruesomeness brought the added heaviness in its story, you'll see the bombs producing a destructive force and flying legs comes with it and bullets penetrating into the skin to the flesh of its victims.This is Mel Gibson's first movie to direct after a some sort of hiatus in movie directing after Apocalypto (2006), Hacksaw Ridge is indeed his comeback film and he definitely earned a lot of respect again. Gibson has a thing with gore, his The Passion Of The Christ (2004) also dealt with a lot of blood and pain, same thing we saw in Hacksaw Ridge, both were great films in its respected area, so I think, gore is what his signature style should be 'cause he's good at it.The movie is a decent retelling of one of the most heartfelt and incredible stories during the WWII, the part I'm looking forward to see is Doss saying these words: ""Please Lord, help me get one more. Help me get one more."" and God! That was my favorite slice of the film."
"Ten years since his last directorial effort 'Apocalypto' and many were wondering if he could match the excellence of his previous work, especially since this hiatus consisted of many controversies for the actor/director. Well, I'm pleased to say that Hacksaw Ridge is most definitely one of the best war films of this century. A bold claim such as this needs proof, and I always say ""proof is in the pudding"". Detailing the efforts of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to carry a weapon, during the battle for Hacksaw Ridge against the Japanese. Illustrating the heroism, valour and bravery of one man who, through inner strength and conviction, saved the lives of many wounded soldiers. I am a sucker for good old fashioned Hollywood stories about a hero who defied all the odds. Everyone and everything was against Doss, including the rest of his unit at first, which automatically creates emotional investment towards our protagonist. You want him to succeed in his endeavours, you want him to prove all the naysayers wrong. He does...and then some. Through visceral direction from Gibson, who honestly directed the heck out of this, Doss was portrayed enigmatically by Garfield. Balancing both innocence and conviction in equal measures to produce a character that breaks your heart. Every facial expression and action Garfield makes feels natural and racks up to be one of his best performances. Supported by an excellent cast, particularly Vaughn, Weaving and Worthington, who provide backstory and development to what could've been expendable assets. The battle scenes were breathtakingly claustrophobic, the usage of blood and violence contradicts the religious subtext in the narrative which further enhances the ideologies of pacifism. Countless bodies on fire and limbs gliding through the explosions, just relentless filmmaking. The overuse of melodrama during the first half did provide an unusual tonal shift for the second half, took me a while to adjust. But, in the end, all I have to say is ""Mel, welcome back!""."
"The BEST WWII film I have seen. Better than Band of Brothers, Fury, and Saving Private Ryan. Mel Gibson is a master cinematographer of the gut- wrenching realism of war, as well as the sweetness of human frailty. I had no knowledge of Desmond Doss nor his bravery. His conviction to his beliefs, faith, and love of country was incredible. Andrew Garfield should have won the Oscar, he is amazing in this film. The depth of character, reading the fear in his eyes, and yet he goes back to save his comrades. Please see this film."
"Mel Gibson's Directorial Return, after a 10 Year Hiatus, is neither an Anti-War or Pro-War Film, it is both.If it wasn't a Documented True Story of Conscientious Objector Desmond Doss who Refused to Touch a Gun, although Enlisting to Serve in WWII, one might get the Impression that the Film was Allegorical about the Resurrected Jesus Christ.That Impression is Felt once the Movie's Second Half turns to the Battle of Okinawa and the ""Hero"" of the New Testament finds Himself in a Hell that is the Human Condition and still Maintains the ""Love Thy Neighbor"" and ""Turn the Other Cheek"" Demeanor that He, by Example, Maintains throughout the Carnage and Slaughter.The Film is Grounded with Good Performances, not only Andrew Garfield, but also with Hugo Weaving as Doss's Father Riveting and Bristling with Gravitas, and others Contributing the Fleshing Out (literally) needed to make the Movie Mesmerizing.The Battle Sequences get a lot of Ink and they are Visceral with the Violence Sharply Cutting on the Edges of the Frame as Garfield's Doss Centers the Action with a Calm that Defies Normal Human Reaction. It's as though He is Cloaked with Protection from an Unearthly Source.The Film is Rife with War Movie and World War II Era Clichés that are Presented with a Pretension of Ease and seem Ironically Necessary to tell the Story. The First Half Develops the Desmond Doss Character and the Second Half Deconstructs the Convictions of His Belief.A Fine Film that is Recommended and Deserves the Attention it has Received because in its Glorious Simplicity it is Accomplished and a Rewarding Experience."
"By far this was the Best Picture of the year, not Moonlight.It had incredible actions, Oscar worth performance from its lead, and top notch sound effects, and flawless special effects.It also was a war movie that felt realistic without being too gory.Mel was robbed!D"
"Gibson hit the mark on this war movie. While it starts off a bit slow it surely picks up the pace and doesn't let go. Vince Vaughn, who I had doubts playing in this movie, was a stand out. Just superb. The war scenes were brutal but realistic. Not for the squeamish. This movie is high on action, but not over the top ""expendables"" type, not that I don't enjoy those movies as well, but this is realistic. It is also inspirational. I for one am not or can never be a conscientious objector but what this soldier did and how he remained true to his convictions and why is what makes it inspirational. That and how he went from outcast to hero being himself. Another movie that used the real life people and soldiers at the end credits to show you the added realism of this movie ad that the actors and director did their homework, Screenwriters, too. This is an instant war classic."
"Hacksaw Ridge is a 2016 film directed by Mel Gibson which marches the viewer in the gory Battle of Okinawa from the perspective of Desmond Doss, a Courageous war medic. While I have watched countless war films from the grave black and white In Harm's Way, to comical war scenes of Forrest Gump, Hacksaw Ridge trumps them all because of Mel Gibson unification of war with personal story allowing the viewer to relate a gigantic, incomprehensible war on a personal level. Because Gibson synergizes macroscopic and microscopic events, the macroscopic being the historic battle of Okinawa and the microscopic being the life and war efforts of the courageous medic, Desmond Doss, the viewer can be impacted by the film in a way that could never be accomplished in a documentary.Gibson reveals details of Desmond Doss' adolescence at the start of the film to allow the viewer to connect emotionally to Doss, even though his adolescence does not directly pertain to the Okinawa War itself. The film begins with Desmond as a teenager fearlessly exploring the outdoors with his brother. As the two scale a bolder- covered mountain, Desmond's brother offers Desmond a hand up a large stone step up to reach the mountain's apex. Grinning, Desmond taps his brothers hand away, saying ""I got it"". In this first scene, Gibson builds enormous character into Desmond Doss. The viewer is not greeted by some generic, run of the mill, soldier on the battle field, he is greeted by a teenager, the age group of a heightened keenness towards uniqueness. The viewer is not presented with a Doss on the battle field, after he is forced by the army into a courageous mold, but is instead presented with a teenage Doss born to be born to be fearless, climbing to the highest ledge on the mountain peak, to dance along its crease, and born to be courageous, climbing to the top without a single helping hand from his older brother. Building details from Doss' youth in the first scenes allows Gibson to portray Doss as an easily relatable individual. Gibson also builds a sturdy foundation of Christianity into the Desmond Doss belief system. As a teenager, Desmond watches his drunk father beat his brother, while wheezing for another glass of whiskey. Desmond's brother collapses from physical and mental trauma. The camera pans from the front lawn where Desmond's older brother lay, to a tearing Desmond Doss in the kitchen, eyes affixed on brutal painting of Cain killing Able, with the bold red lettering underneath, ""Thou Shal Not Kill"", one of the Ten Commandments of the Lord. Doss prays to God. Later in the film, Desmond reveals that it was because of that painting, and watching his father nearly kill his brother, that he promised God to never touch a rifle, an incredible promise Desmond attempts to keep all through the war. The second object that Gibson reoccurring displays, to support Dosses appearance as a Christian, is a bible which Doss' Fiancé gifts to him through the window of his training camp bus, while saying good bye. ""Keep it close to your heart"", she reminds him. While the training camps other members read the Playboy Magazine other worldly material, Doss keeps his eyes on the bible, reading verses to himself every free moment. While ridiculed by his peers, Doss boldly continues reading and holding onto the bible until while fighting at Hacksaw ridge. The Hacksaw Ridge War Scene is brutally realistic, with blood, explosions, and death, each of which the average viewer cannot relate to. But when Gibson narrows the scope down to a war torn Doss, pleading too his carriers on a stretcher to find his bible where he had been wounded on the battle field, the scope of the battle is automatically put into perspective. The viewer, who is emotionally connected to Desmond Doss and understands his character, cannot reduce him to another soldier and must see him as the courageous, moral, and selfless individual, that Doss is. This perspective places invites the audience to ask, ""What would I do in Doss' situation"", a question that throws the viewer right beside Doss on his stretcher, begging with him for the bloodstained bible that he clung onto through his entire service in the cold bloody war. A war documentary's viewer-immersion-factor cannot compare to this Hacksaw Ridge's. Finally, what makes Hacksaw Ridge a classic is not only how Gibson portrays Doss, but also the choice in choosing Doss to be the star of the film. The story of Doss is remarkable. When called by his commander at the war-front to retreat in battle, Doss hears his true calling from God to save the remaining men that were injured and abandoned on the field, positioned to be tortured by ruthless Japanese. Doss remains on Japanese territory alone, healing each injured Soldier he finds, including some injured Japanese, dragging them across the line of combat, into American Territory. Doss selflessly prays with each soldier he saves, ""Lord, help me find one more"" before running back into the devastated enemy terrain, until finding one more soldier and dragging them into American Territory. Doss, alone, saves 75 men, and without Doss' courageous actions, a mere 35 men would have returned from the week's fight. Desmond Doss' faith in God and bravery in the face of the worst danger is the inspiring plot that allows Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge to impact the masses.Using details from Desmond Doss' adolescence, and displaying his character, Gibson connects the viewer emotionally to Doss, allowing the war which takes place around Doss to impact the viewer. Overall, Desmond Doss' actions leave the viewer with both a feeling of humility, longing to emulate the bravery of an American citizen nearly giving one's life to save many, and a feeling of courage, watching American demonstrate pure heroism. Hacksaw Ridge should remain an American classic forever."
"This is a film I have been waiting to see for a while, so as you can imagine the hype was growing by the minute. And then i saw it. This film is absolutely mesmerizing, hats off to you Mr Gibson you made and extraordinary piece of film making. From the masterful camera-work and framing of the shots to the Oscar worthy performances he has managed to capture out of ever single cast member. Yep when you manage to get a good performance out of Luke Bracey (Utah- Point Break 2015) you know you are a legend. This film absolutely moved me, Desmond Doss is one of the most inspiring men of all time and his story is captured so well here, I won't spoil his story here but my god is it inspiring. This film absolutely positively deserves a 10/10 rating.This is the best movie of 2016 by far and everybody should experience it."
loove this movie so much!! Andrew Garfield is so amazing in this!! He really gives his all to his role. I cannot believe that this is a true story. This is such a great story about faith and hope and it deserves all the wins that it can get. It is probably one of my favorite war movies ever! I love that there's some comedy in here as well. I will never forget watching this movie in theatres.
"I was really surprised with this film. I didn't expect to like it so much. The story and characters are intriguing. The action is bloody and suspenseful. It's all based on a true story of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who was a devoted Christian and refused to carry a firearm during WWII. Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Doss, a young man who enlists in the army to help people. He wants to be a medic and save lives, but not kill. Everyone ridicules him for it to the point where he's beaten up, and almost arrested for insubordination. His father helps by sending a letter to the court from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. Soon enough, he's released and able to join his squad to the battle of Okinawa. During the bloody war, Desmond will do whatever it takes to save the wounded men, even without so much as picking up a gun. His faith and skills are put to the test. I don't usually go for war films, but this one is special. I highly recommend HACKSAW RIDGE!!!"
"I don't know what I can add to the other reviews on here. This story of Desmond Doss reminds of the books of David McCullough. He writes his books about people in American history that have too long not received their dues, and it's about time we gave credit where credit is due. That is how I feel about the main character in this movie. Why haven't I ever heard about him before now!? The gore in the battle scenes puts Walking Dead to shame, but it's about time we see what war is really like. It's not about parades and flags and fireworks; it's the hand to hand blood and fire, sweat, and unimaginable fear that these people endured. It is no wonder they are called the greatest generation. Desmond Doss is my new hero because of this movie, and it deserves every nomination it has received for every award. Bravo!"
"Hacksaw Ridge was supposed to be the glorious directorial return of Mel Gibson and is a tale (based on a true story!) about a soldier that refuses to carry a gun and rescues fellow soldiers on a battlefield. Sounds like Oscar worthy idea for a movie, sadly it falls flat on its face on the most basic level - being a good movie...I was able to watch about half an hour of this movie before I just left the theater. There's so many things that I just couldn't stand. I'll give you few points:1) in your freaking face catholic propaganda - I felt like 75% of dialogues and characters actions had something to do with catholic religion. Crosses everywhere, main character working for the church, soldiers biting their rosaries in the middle of the battle (so powerful symbolism right, like 'oh god, give me power and forgive me at the same time' or whatever), etc etc 2) lame love story 3) the biggest sin of all - battle scenes. They are absolutely goofy, bonkers and loony tunes cartoonish. How about a shot of guts and corpses interweaved with soldiers walking through this mess? Guts, soldiers, guts, soldiers, corpse, soldiers. I GET IT MEL! How about the guy, who is using dismembered corpse of another soldier as a shield, shooting rambo style, killing 4 enemies in a row. How about grenades and mortars blowing up next to the soldiers who then fly in all directions like freaking rabbits? Why does it feel like all of those soldiers on fire (in the beginning of the movie) were just told to jump on trampolines in greenscreen rooms (yes, special effects are THAT noticeable), and so on and so forth dude...The last 'in your face' bad war movie (in my opinion of course) was American Sniper directed by Clint Eastwood. There was similar oversaturation of catholic themes, America, questionable motivations of characters, etc. But at least it was watchable, Hacksaw Ridge is just laughably goofy.2/10"
"Well, the first hour of Hacksaw Ridge is very sloooow and of course the hero marries a beautiful nurse he met... Yawn. After that you get a long-stretched and far more brutal version of Forrest Gumps Nam-hero scenes, sometimes underlined with very cheesy emotional music. Well, after all the fuzz over Mr. Gibsons behavior he must ofc deliver something to get back a favorable public opinion. I liked Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ a lot, also Apocalypto, and ofc Braveheart, but compared this is rather a weak movie. I don't know why but between all the explosions and killed soldiers and the gore I don't see why this movie should be a new classic or Oscar material at all. Compared with (anti-)war movies like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Paths of Glory, Das Boot, Hotel Rwanda and the like I find this output of Mr. Gibson rather mediocre. Well, sure we get some fine action scenes and lots of gore but this imo don't defines a (anti-) war-movie as a good one, the story of this one is rather stereotypical and stereotypical told and not very interesting - I mean with or without gun, there were and are thousands of medics always ""in action"", without such fuss about having no gun or having a gun. A movie told about a unit of medics, that would have been something to honor those men (and women), but this movie is something about a stubborn Christian guy which in my view is not very likable (all ppl talking to and with god are in my view highly suspicious ;)) I will just raise one question - if those hero has the choice to grab a gun and shoot a Japanese soldier to save one comrades life - what would be his decision!? This movie gives no answer to questions like this and is therefore imo just sentimental and a praise of Christian belief without contributing anything new to the questions war and its realities raise.And the last ""heroic"" scene - our medic praying and the unit waiting for him to finish before to start the attack and then the attack in slow-mow with VERY cheesy music - this is just bad, a persiflage, a comical end to something who tries to be a movie about a serious matter. In the end our hero even plays football with nades... And ofc with help of the prayer of our hero and the help of the old god of Abraham the US boys beat the evil Japanese. No more to be said.note: the nades kicking scene raises in my view the question how many ppl our hero killed (friends and enemies) unintentionally in just kicking them away in an overcrowded battlefield like depicted ;)"
"Focuses too much on the simple premise rather than creating a good story around the circumstances. So the main character doesn't like guns, okay we get it. All this movie does is hammer this idea and try to make something profound from the character's religions motivations. The result is quite boring.""My bible! My bible!""... prepare to cringe. I can't recommend this movie, there's no reason for a feature to be made from this.Regardless of how many people the guy saved, he still put his comrades at risk by not arming himself. He got lucky, so what? God had nothing to do with that. I'm not sure if this film is suggesting that this was God's miracle or just a religious nut-case who got lucky.Either way, the story is not inspirational, and the actual film wasn't very creative or elevated beyond clichéd American patriotism and stereotypical supporting roles."
"I have watched lots of good war movies in my life. The difference between a good and mediocre war movie is the difference of plots and the amount of action. When watching Hacksaw Ridge, you will jump out of your seat and ugly cry until the night is young. The emotional rollercoaster of victories and losses is the perfect balance of war and tranquility. There's bombs, soldiers, and bullets galore. There's also bravery, empathy, and heroism beyond compare. This movie is based on a true story of a soldier who single handedly saved the lives of many of his fellow soldiers in World War 2. The virtues and lessons of this movie make it a very interesting and enticing movie to watch.During a moment of weakness, we tend to feel that there is nothing that we can do that would ever make a difference. That even though we may have completed the task, it would never be as impactful as we had hoped. However Hacksaw Ridge reminds us that no matter how small a victory may seem, it can make some of the biggest differences. During one of the most pivotal scenes in the movie, Desmond Doss is confronted with a very conflicting issue. He finds that he can't bare himself to kill anyone in the very gruesome war that is surrounding him. There is a short moment of pure terror for him because he truly has no idea how he was going to help out for his fellow soldiers, and for his country. However, he finds a whole new task when he sees a fallen soldier in the battlefield, who has no way of getting back to safety. In the spur of the moment he decides that he is going to save all of the men who cannot save themselves due to major injuries. He sacrificed his life to save ll of the soldiers that he did. Even though he wasn't fighting on the field, like he was intended to, he single-handedly saved 75 soldiers during that war. His story is one that people will remember for a very long time, and his nobility and sacrifices are what makes this movie so impactful.This movie also has a great way of balancing dramatic scenes with calmer ones. It blends the two together seamlessly and leaves the viewers crying from laughter then screaming in terror as a character they love gets thrown into peril. That's another great thing about this movie. The director wasn't afraid to put the main characters into a vulnerable position. In a typical war hero movie, the character or ""hero"" is usually seen as the almighty person who could never be defeated. However the roles can be completely reversed in this movie and it is very refreshing. In the movie you have the actor who plays Desmond Doss, Darcy Bryce, who is known for his emotional, yet impactful performances. He brings just the right balance of wit, strength, and vulnerability to really pull of the role of Desmond Doss. In a few particular scenes during the war, he has a sort of inner turmoil going on inside of his head that is narrated throughout the movie. These narrarations let us know that he is truly scared for his future, and this adds not only to the seriousness of the situation, but also to the overall performance. Hacksaw ridge isn't your typical war story. You get to see first hand, what it's like for the hero to lose a battle, whether it be a physical or mental battle.Hacksaw Ridge is not for the faint of heart. Yes, there is a little something for everyone in the movie including comedy, action, and heroism. However it sticks to the original story, which is a gruesome one. This movie is for those who seek a good hearted war story that has a historical background. Hacksaw Ridge stays true to the original events that actually happened, and this promotes an honest and wholesome story that everyone can learn from. The act of selflessness can be a pretty hard topic to try and cover, because it is such an expansive topic, and people tend to just brush off the idea or purpose of it. This is because it's hard; people don't want to put others safety and well being in front of their own. However I think it's something that people could really learn from, and I think that Hacksaw Ridge portrays the true meaning of this really well."
"Saving 75 Lives out there on the war field is nothing less than a miracle.Another brilliant biopic of 2016.Desmond Doss had a belief of non violence and he sticks to it even after getting into the US army, serving for the nation. Its no less than a heroic tale of an Army Man who refused to kill on the war field and instead chose to save. Desmond has a troubled childhood getting beaten by his father every day and his father was an ex army drunkard who used to beat his sons and wife. Desmond decides to join Army and serve his nation being a medic. He is bullied and beaten in the Army by other men but he doesn't give up...shows courage and tenaciously stays"
"I liked how the movie started (the story around desmonds father and the love story with Dorothy). But in this moment the battle begun, it's getting ridiculous! 
During the training they all make fun of Desmond. ""Skinny boy"", ""beanpole"", etc. But on the battlefield he carries his fallen comrades on his shoulders all night long. ...under fire, on a rough terrain. No sorry, this is just stupid! Did you ever try to carry your buddy like this over 50m? Hard enough, huh?Tbh, I don't believe, that Smitty kicks desmond down the wall during the drill. It's a classic and 1000 times seen ""scumbag turns into buddy"" scene and it's so damn obsolete and implausible!There's only one way up and when the japanese soldiers reached the edge, but they don't cut the ropes or throw grenades down there. Come on! *facepalm*Human torso shields... are you kidding me?Grenades was kicked and slapped away. ...please!After a while everybody down in the camp notices, that Desmond is all alone on the battlefield to save as much comrades as he can, but not a single man climbs up to help him? No one? Really?Just read the other reviews with low ratings and you'll read about a lot more stupid scenes. Sorry Mr. Gibson, but seeing this movie and read something like ""a true story"" at the beginning, feels like insulting my intelligence."
"It is easy to misunderstand Mel Gibson's ""Hacksaw Ridge"" as a glorified war movie. At least that is what I used to think every time I gave this movie a pass in the past looking at the poster. I was so wrong..""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a movie which takes you back in time. A time when men left their homes to attend to war duties and made great sacrifices. In that context the movie sends out a clear message for everyone who watches it - ""Strong convictions precedes great action"". And this message is shared by depicting the true story of a hero - Desmond T. Doss. It's an inspirational story. The story teaches you to stick by your beliefs and stand up for the good even when the world is against you. It's a great watch."
