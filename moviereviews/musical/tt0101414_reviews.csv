"Beauty and the Beast is without a doubt one of Disney's finest classics. The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination. Beauty and the Beast is going to be one of those films that will always be remembered, I know that it's a movie that I will show my children one day. It has unbelievably terrific animation, a beautiful story, lovable characters, and is just over all a perfect movie. I really love this film so much, I don't think anyone couldn't fall in love with it.Bell is just a simple girl in her town in France, she reads books constantly and her father is an inventor. They are sort of the outcasts of their town due to their ""oddness"". But Bell is being pursued by the town hunk, Gueston, simply because she's the one girl he cannot have. One day when her father's inventions are about to be displayed at the fair, he gets lost in the woods and stumbles across a castle and is held prisoner. Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts. Bell trades places with her father; the house also has living objects, a candle holder, a clock, a tea pot, all who are also cursed until the curse is broken. They look at Bell as the perfect opportunity for the beast to find a true love, but he must learn to be a gentleman, but Bell brings out the best in him and it turns out that this might be a happy ending after all.This was actually the first movie that I ever cried in, the ending was just so beautiful and heart felt, you'll have to see what I mean. The songs are just so lovely and perfect for the scenes that they are performed for. Beauty and the Beast, the song, was just one of the most touching songs ever. This films is a major recommendation for me, it's one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's a timeless classic that is just perfect and reached a new level of great animation.10/10"
"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one ""Beauty and the Beast"" is worth a thousand ""Akira""s. And ""Shrek""s. And, I'm willing to bet, ""Treasure Planet""s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - this is the real best picture of 1991."
"Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Gaston,' you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores. You will enjoy it!"
"Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply:  love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.'  And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale.  When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return.  And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation. 
	The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything. Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep.  Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey.  Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him:  If he will release her father, she will stay in his place.  The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever.  And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed. The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.	With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts.  There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it. It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly.  A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year).  	The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster).  There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made:  As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.  And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away.  It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why `Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's all time greatest films. 
	One final note:  Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.  Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience.  It's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."
"a great movie story done with wondrous animation and lovely music.  the pacing was perfect, the music blended extremely well with the action, and each character was developed charmingly.  the contrast between the mean but insecure beast plays very well against the lovely but bright and secure belle.  the animation was top notch: even now, after disney has had time to develop better computer animation techniques, it still has beautiful color and flow.  except for pinocchio, I don't know any disney movie more lovely. It's a movie that appeals to children of all ages, especially adults : )enough of the ""technical stuff""  let's get on to my emotional attachment to the movie.I remember the first time I saw B&tB so vividly; I was completely enthralled by the movie that all I could do on the way home was smile and cry.  I've seen it many, many times, yet the ballroom scene still gives me goose bumps. Angela Landsbury as Mrs. Potts sings the title song with so much feeling that every time I hear the song, I'm swept away back to that ballroom.
I was also moved by Belle's strength of self worth and generosity.  She is a heroine I'd love girls to emulate.  She knows what she wants, but yet is sensitive to others in trying to achieve that goal.  She also learns to apologize and to forgive, no small task.I've loved this movie from the start, and it has grown into an obsession. I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift.  So I know my opinion is strongly biased : )  but I hope you get a chance to see this film and judge for yourself.  I realize it is difficult to get access to the videos or laser discs (check out the spanish version cover imdb is using in B&tB's page) but it is well worth the search.  The first time is most magical.  I envy you."
"I've not seen the newly added song sequence (Human Again) featured in the latest IMAX version so my comments are based entirely on the original theatrical and VHS release.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is Disney at its peak. From the stained glass window at the opening and the beautiful narration, the viewer is drawn into the story by the appealing music and clever lyrics (""Belle's Song"") which gets the picture off to a bouncy start. The opening sequence showing Belle and the townspeople in song is masterfully handled and choreographed for maximum effect, setting the tone for the entire story.The plot becomes thicker once Belle's father enters the castle grounds where the Beast resides. The castle interiors are brilliantly Baroque and the odd characters inhabiting the grounds are delightfully rendered by a perfect blending of art and voice talent. Cogsworth, Lumiere and Mrs. Potts are delightful creations, each with strong, consistent personalities. David Ogden Stiers, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury cannot be praised enough for their contributions. Two of the musical highlights are Orbach's dazzling job on ""Be My Guest"" (with French accent) and Angela's tender rendering of the title song, ""Beauty and the Beast"". Unforgettable movie moments. As Gaston, Richard White's robust baritone voice adds greatly to the effectiveness of his villainy.It's no wonder the film was the first to receive recognition by the Academy with a Best Picture nomination. Outstanding in every department, including the end title song sung by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson in a more ""modern"" style. Along with SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY, a top-notch fairy tale with its appeal evenly divided between adults and children--as well as the child in all of us."
"This is a classic movie. We have breakthrough films like Snow White and Fantasia, and we have other greats like Aladdin and The Lion King, but this definitely tops them all. There is so much here that is missing in other Disney classics. This film has emotion, incredible music and animation, characters that you admire, laugh at, and despise. This movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. We can all relate with the suffering of the Beast (being an outsider), and we all know a Gaston in our lives. The way we can identify with the characters sucks us into the story. Don't miss this classic...the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar."
"Who can resist this beautiful story? I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside! And what girl hasn't known a Gaston in their lives? I thought it was so great how he was put in his place! All the voiceovers are amazing, especially Robby Benson as Beast. Another Disney masterpiece."
"When an arrogant Prince turns away an old woman looking for shelter with only a rose for a gift, she warns him not to just take the surface appearance as being the all of a person; however he rejects her a second time  only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful enchantress. She casts a spell on him, turning him into a beast with the only hope of return being to fall in love with a woman and have her fall in love with him before the rose wilts and dies. Resembling a carpet stuffed with walnuts, the prince figures he has no chance and withdraws into his castle. When an elderly man wanders into the castle, the Beast holds him prisoner and only lets him go when his daughter, Belle, offers to replace him in the Beast's castle. With time running out, the Beast's staff hope that Belle will be the one to break the curse but the Beast cannot remember how.Being quite a cynical, acerbic person I must admit that I prefer modern animated films that deliver lots of adult humour along with a good emotional story and often I struggle to enjoy films that take the more traditional Disney route. However with this film I was quite taken by how classy the whole affair was, with great effort being shown in every area from the animation, to the songs through to the emotionally involving story whose telling is touched with a nice sense of wonder throughout. The story doesn't really hit many bum notes (I thought Gaston's sidekick was a bit too obvious and half cooked) and it is interesting and enjoyable for the vast majority of the time. The story and comedy is aimed at both adults and children  but the stuff for kids is not basic pratfalls, nor is the adult material just a load of references or suggestive jokes. Instead the two are quite well blended with good physical comedy and plenty of wit. Again, it is the sense of spectacle and wonder that came through that I really appreciated.The animation feels more impressive for the reliance on mostly traditional animation rather than computer effects  in fact the computer effects look a bit dated now, even if they do still produce the goods in some key scenes. Mainly it is the feeling that every frame has had a lot of effort and love put into it that makes the whole affair feel classy. The songs are also great and feature quite a few memorable songs that stick in the mind; meanwhile the choreography of these scenes is generally very imaginative (Be Our Guest was my favourite). The cast don't feature many big stars and perhaps this is good because the real people don't distract from their characters. That said, I thought that Benson, O'Hara, White and a few others were quite unremarkable even if they were good enough for the film. Orbach, Stiers, Lansbury and others provided comic work in the support characters and everything worked well.Overall this is a really classy animated film that shows the effort and care put into it in many different regards. It does suffer a bit from cuteness and sentimentality but I didn't think this was a massive problem or something that was not to be expected from Disney and generally I really enjoyed the film and see it as one of the films that define Disney for people of my generation."
"Only second to ""The Little Mermaid"" on my list of favorite Disney classics, I have been captivated by ""Beauty"" ever since seeing it in the movies in 1992 (I was 7). The film combines the best of Disney: stunning visuals, appealing characters, great music and a timeless story. The first thing you notice about B&B is the gorgeous artwork - the film opens with an eye-popping shot of a forest and remains a visual delight throughout its 90 minute run-time. B&B includes some of the best Disney songs as well, most notably ""Belle"", ""Something There"" and the title song. I own the soundtrack and the score is just as good (""The West Wing"" and ""Transformation"" being my favorites). I also think Belle and the beast make a great couple. There's chemistry between them and their romance doesn't feel forced, but natural and genuine. I was very pleased with my 1993 LaserDisc so I was quite hesitant to obtain the blu ray, fearing it would ruin my enjoyment from the film (wasn't too familiar with the format just 2 years ago). Gladly, I was wrong and the film looks breathtaking in HD (although I do reduce the saturation, given the colors are a little too garish to my taste). Now we just have to wait for my other favorite Disney classic to arrive on Blu Ray, The Little Mermaid."
"Beauty and the Beast (1991): Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Richard White, Rex Everhart, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Angela Lansbury, Jesse Corti, Bradley Pierce, Jo Anne Worley, Mary Kay Bergman, Kath Soucie Kimmy Robertson, Brian Cummings, Tony Jay, Alvin Epstein, Frank Welker, Scott Barnes, Bruce Adler, Jack Angel, Vanna Bonta....Disney entered the 1990's with ""Beauty and the Beast"", by far their most unabashedly romantic film and for many viewers, their all-time greatest achievement. There is so much to admire and love about this terrific film which was adored by the critics and hailed as an instant classic at the time of its release in 1991. It was so loved that it became the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The 18th century French fairy-tale is given a twist to cater to a more modern audience A selfish and heartless prince (Robby Benson) falls victim to an enchantress' curse and is transformed into a beast. His castle is bewitched and even his domestics are turned into household objects such as candelabras, clocks, feather dusters, teacups and kitchen utensils. Only the love of a woman can redeem the prince and only when she sees past the monster and into his humanity can he become human again. Enter Belle (Paige 0'Hara)the beautiful single daughter of an old and eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart) who lives in a small town in rural France. Belle stands out from the other townsfolk in her fondness for books, her individuality and her intellect. Bored of provincial life, she longs for ""adventure in the great wide somewhere"". She's pursued by Gaston (Richard White) a hunky but vain, self-absorbed and wicked hunter who wants to marry Belle and make her his ""trophy wife"". When Maurice sets off to sell his new invention to a fair, he becomes lost in the woods and stumbles into the Beast's castle. Before long he becomes his prisoner. Belle comes to the rescue but in order to save her father she must replace him as the Beast's prisoner. What ensues is a ""tale as old as time"". Despite his monstrousness, Belle learns to see past all that and in time tames the Beast herself. Their relationship is based on respect for one another as human beings, exemplified when Beast saves Belle's life and she in turn saves his. But it's not long before the villagers discover the Beast's existence and Gaston leads a murderous mob to attack the castle. The late Broadway singer Jerry Orbach provides comic relief as Lumiere, an amorous French candelabra and David Ogden Stiers portrays the stuffy British clock Cogsworth. Broadway icon and British actress Angela Lansbury portrays the kindly voice of reason, Mrs. Potts and young Bradley Pierce portrays her son Chip. Jesse Corti plays Lefou, Gaston's awkward and goofy sidekick. These minor characters, purely there for comic relief and cuteness, not only entertains younger audiences but they are so wonderfully portrayed by the actor's voices that even adults can enjoy them. It is through voices that can act as well as sing (Paige O'Hara, Richard White, Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury are all Broadway singers) in harmony with a solid plot and superior animation that this film truly shines. Beauty and the Beast still ranks as Disney's all-time greatest after 16 years. In fact, Disney does not make films like this anymore, owing to the excess use of computer graphics which can often dominate the story itself. Shortly after the success of the film, a Broadway musical was made, one that is still enjoyed to this date. And this film contains many wonderful song numbers: ""Belle"" - a gossip song as the villagers follow Belle on her way to the bookstore, ""Gaston"" sung by Gaston and his drinking buddies in his honor, ""Be Our Guest"" as the enchanted castle's staff entertains Belle for dinner, ""Something There"" a duet sung by the leads as they begin to fall in love and the title song ""Beauty and the Beast"" sung by Mrs. Potts as the newfound friends waltz beneath an opulent chandelier. This romantic song was popularized when a young Celine Dion, not yet a major star, sang a duet with Peabo Bryson for the soundtrack. With its theme of beauty found within, a woman's courage and virtue rewarded, the movie is also a sort of women's empowerment film for girls. Belle, the first Disney princess of the 90's, is strong, resourceful and dares to be different. Far from being a damsel in distress, it is she who rescues the Beast from doom and fights the villain Gaston by firmly renouncing him as a lover. Brilliant music and songs by Alan Menken and a splendid cinematography that used stunning computer-graphic art for such scenes as the ballroom waltz, this film was ahead of its time and marked the beginning of the great Disney films of the 90's - Aladdin, Lion King, Pocahontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame and others, all which used special effects made of computer graphic art. For this film, animators drew inspiration from Romantic 19th century art(Fragonard and Bouche) and from Loire Valley castles. Animators also drew from Cocteau's 1946 live-action version. The look of this film, the attention to detail, is a real winner and it's a pity that Disney does not return to pure animation. For me, this is the zenith of Disney animation and a representation of classic Disney at its best in the 1990's. This is a wonderful film for both young and old and looks as great as it ever did, thanks to restorations as seen on the new DVD version, where you can enjoy seeing how the film was made and scenes that were never part of the original theatrical release. Enjoy this romantic classic today with a date or with the whole family."
"I still remember watching this movie when I was very little. I did not appreciate it as much then, but now because I am older, I can cherish this blessed masterpiece. The music in this movie is one of the best film scores ever and contains the catchiest Disney tunes. Who could ever forget the ever-popular ballroom scene? This movie, in my opinion was Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's best! I also think that this is the best Disney movie made after the great Walt Disney passed away.I had the opportunity of seeing the Special Edition on IMAX. What an experience! The scenes were breathtaking to see on such a large screen. I even found the new song ""Human Again"" very entertaining.It's such a shame that Disney hasn't made a movie like this since ""Mulan"". ""Beauty and the Beast"" will be forever remembered as the epitome of modern-day Disney movies (and should have won the Best Picture Oscar instead of ""The Silence of the Lambs""). Bravo to Disney!"
"The first and possibly last animated movie to be nominated for best picture, and it should have won. This is an absolutely beautiful movie, and it makes me miss the art of hand drawn animation. Don't get me wrong Scilence of the Lambs was great movie and its really a tough choice but i think this one should have won. I hate to admit it but it brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it. If only Disney could get back to the likes of this film, and stop dicking around with the boring cgi movies. I hope someday we will see an animated movie win best picture, but sadly i think it will not happen, the only one in my opinion that came close was spirited away, and thats still no Beauty and the Beast."
"Beauty and the Beast tells the story of Belle, an unusual but beautiful girl, who goes in search of her inventor father and comes across a mysterious castle. She enters the castle in search of her father, to discover it is occupied by a beast. She becomes his prisoner. The beast is loveless and thankless, but she soon begins to fall in love with him, and he with her. The film's end is happy, satisfying, and inspiring, showing what the power of love can do.Beauty and the Beast is a charming story of love and magic. It features lovely music. Songs like ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Be Our Guest"", and ""Belle"" are catchy and fun to listen to. It features first-class characters: the quirky Belle; Gaston, the hateful attractive villain; the Beast, a character one can't help but feels sorry for; the enchanted objects - Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, and Lumiere, characters that bring a lighthearted quality to the movie. Beauty and the Beast also features excellent executed animation. It isn't hard to tell all the talent, the sweat, and the heart that was put in this film. The ballroom sequence, and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema.Beauty and the Beast is great in another aspect: it's ageless. Although it appears to be a children-oriented film, it doesn't take much for an adult to find it extraordinarily appealing. It's a fabulous film for the whole family to watch and enjoy.When I first saw Beauty and the Beast, I fell in love with it. It's a beautiful tale, an engaging musical, and wonderful fable of romance. One of the greatest examples of traditional animation in recent years, it will go down in history with other beautiful Disney masterpieces, like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, and Cinderella."
"I dunno about you, but this flick is without a doubt one of Disney's best and their most beautiful movies, which makes it my all-time favorite. The characters are very well-developed and have multiple dimensions to their personalities, not to mention particularly different to the typical Disney character. Belle's wanting to escape her life to see the world(which is the reason why, amongst other things, she is my all-time favorite Disney princess) and hate for Gaston, the best-looking guy in town, Gaston's vanity and lust for Belle's hand in marriage, and Beast's evolution in his hate for Belle to his love for her, which she experiences too, helped make this movie the beautiful masterpiece it is.The music, which was by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, is without a doubt the some of the best music Disney has made. From the eerie, yet beautiful twinkling of the ""Prologue"", the introduction of Belle and Gaston's personalities and wants in ""Belle"", the the get-up-and-dance fun of the musical extravaganza ""Be Our Guest"", and the simply magnificent ""Beauty and the Beast"", amongst the other songs of the film, work together to push the story forward, express characters' inner-most thoughts and feelings, and are just plain entertaining. Menken's scores too were quite beautiful, especially the ""Transformation"" score, which conveys extremely well a range of emotions, from Beast's dying to the triumphant finale.And what would this movie be without the animation? The sweeping of the camera to Belle and Beast dancing in the ballroom during ""Beauty and the Beast"", which gives me the chills every time, to the ominous darkness of Belle's trek into the forbidden West Wing, along side with the music, make it a treat for both the eyes and the ears.All in all, the movie is a pure masterpiece in many ways and forms and it clearly deserved all the awards and nominations it received, including the nomination for the Best Picture Oscar. This is a movie all Disney fans should watch and I guarantee you'll enjoy it."
"It has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword, but when this age-old phrase is converted to modern times, it translates to ""the desktop is mightier than the pencil."" There's no denying that the computer has become a tool used across the world, whether for political reasons, or for business or especially for educational purposes. Computers have also been adopted by the film industry to give their works of art a shinier feel and along with the visual effects wizards, the filmmakers who use these electronic devices the most are the animators. After a while, it was uncertain whether the cel-based animation used to create such classics like The Little Mermaid and Pinocchio would be completely dropped in favour of the quicker and slicker style. While studios like DreamWorks may have given up on them, the folks at the world's pioneering animation studio are still behind the pencil-and-paper animation that has enchanted families for generations. Looking back at one of their essential works, Beauty and the Beast brings back memories of not only nostalgia, but also warmth. Quite possibly the greatest love story ever told, this ""tale as old as time"" has always been told by bringing pen to paper. From its candle-lit beginnings by a French writer many years ago to the Disney animators who brought joys to people of all ages, Beauty and the Beast has always touched the heart.The main part of what makes Beauty and the Beast such a brilliant film is the fact that the relationship between the two title characters doesn't feel artificial or one-dimensional, even though they're drawn on paper. Unlike other famous fairy tales, Beauty and the Beast feels quite realistic in its definition of love. The story breaks all conventions by not going the ""love at first sight"" route and letting the romance progress at a reasonable pace. Belle also proves to be the most interesting Disney heroine, as she doesn't fit the norm of typical princesses like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Unlike the aforementioned characters, Belle is not bland, but actually as a personality. She defines individuality and seeks to do more than just marry a prince. Her annoyance at Gaston is not only humorous, but also shows that her ideas of romance don't consist of ""a rustic hunting lodge... my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife, massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs... we'll have six or seven,"" as Gaston puts it. The Beast is also a rather stubborn, but loving personality. Despite his tough exterior is a nice person at heart which Belle begins to realise the more into the relationship they enter.Adding to the brilliance of the chemistry between Beauty and the Beast are the songs from Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman. Although both did terrific work on The Little Mermaid and their cult musical Little Shop of Horrors, the music in Beauty and the Beast stands as their best. The title theme song is quite possibly one of the most romantic songs ever written, combining beautiful lyrics with a very memorable melody. This song enhances the film's famous ballroom scene to ever impressive heights, already helped by the breathtaking animation in the sequence. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was not written as just a way to sell soundtracks and win Oscars. It adds another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other. It is both moving and deep. The other songs provided by the team also contribute wonderfully to the film, from a show-stopping Broadway number called ""Be Our Guest"" to the very funny ode to ""Gaston."" They're bursting with energy and humour made even more poignant by the fact they would feature the last lyrics written by Ashman (who had also already contributed some work to Aladdin). It's a brilliant way to end his career and the end credits homage him perfectly: ""To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)""Probably one of the most important ingredients that make Beauty and the Beast such a success is the startling animation. The animators at Disney did a terrific job at making everything absolutely perfect, from the character designs to the sets. Each character has their feel, whether comedic or dramatic, and the animators allow them to breath, seamlessly combining the actor's voice to the moving drawings. The sets are also worthy of mention, particularly the look of the Beast's castle. The Gothic castle is drawn and painted beautifully from top to behind, so much so you're forgetting you're watching an animated film. The film is bright and colourful, but also dark and dreary when necessary. As mentioned before, the ballroom sequence combines Menken and Ashman's music with the animation flawlessly, giving a completely magical feel to it. When computers are brought into the scene, it seams in perfectly, not feeling distracted in the least. Beauty and the Beast most certainly stands as Disney animation at its finest.Some of the best animated films in the world have come from the Walt Disney studios and Beauty and the Beast is deservedly one of their crown jewels. At the film's release, it was honoured with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, a rare feat for an animated film. It proves that like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within."
"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is one of the greatest Disney films to ever grace audiences. A personal favorite, the story of Beauty and her growing love for the Beast is one that people have enjoyed through the years, from the theater to Broadway.I first saw Beauty and the Beast when I was a little girl, around the time that I watched the other Disney classics. And, like I did with the others, I fell in love. The stunning animation and soundtrack coupled with the captivating story kept me in my seat till the very end.This movie is thrilling, with it's message of how love can happen even if the people in question aren't incredibly beautiful. Although the idea of the Beast changing to a prince doesn't sit well with me-- Beauty fell in love with the animal, not the man-- the film is a treasure from Disney."
"When I saw the first advertising for Beauty and the Beast -- a cardboard stand-up in a movie theater -- I nearly burst into tears. Just the ADVERTISEMENT was hauntingly beautiful, tapping into some deep human reality. Hasn't everyone, at some time, felt like a hideous beast hungry for someone to love us as we are and in doing so, transform us into something beautiful?The film itself more than delivered. Belle was the first Disney heroine who wasn't either boy-crazy or a doormat/victim. She has brains, heart, and above all, character. The Beast's transformation from monster to hero is believable and poignant. In a world where possessiveness has become the norm (witness the selfish custody battles of birth parents tearing children from the only homes they've ever known), the Beast's heart-wrenching insistence that he had to let Belle leave because he loves her is a breath of fresh air.The music is perfection, the animation astonishing. Together they raise filmmaking of any kind to new challenges. The ballroom scene is heartbreakingly beautiful.If you've been in a coma for ten years or have some other excuse for never having seen this gem of a movie, correct that omission as soon as possible. And have a hankie nearby."
"'' The Beauty and The Beast'' is one of the greatest stories ever told and one of the best movies from Disney that I watched in my life. I always identified myself with Belle, the girl who does not belong the place where she is lives and also with a big taste of reading lots of books. Our story takes part in France in 18 century, and our main character Belle is the prettiest girl in the city she lives, being the object of the affection and interest of Gaston, an arrogant man that has the sympathy of the people of the region.(And also considered a big catch for the girls of the city)But Belle is not interested in him and always imagined her life different from the domestic life people always imagine for her.One day, Belle's father, an inventor, was going to sell one of his inventions and lost his ways, being attacked by wild animals and entering in a big dark mansion apparently without a owner. He stays there for a time, but soon the Beast comes up and attacks him,making him a prisoner in his castle.Belle stays worried and goes after her father in the mansion and there she sees the violent and awful beast who locked her father. She then makes a deal: Belle agrees to stay in the dark castle with the horrible beast in return to her father's freedom. But with the time, Belle is going to discover all the magic that is beyond the castle, including the talking objects and even a nice side that the Beast has.This story is very inspiring and very beautiful! =)"
"No other Disney movie in my oppinion, except for some of the classics from fifty years ago can compare to Beauty and the Beast. Disney hasn't made any good movies really in the past fifteen years except this. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Disey, Musicals, or movies at all. It is a true classic!!!!!!!!!!"
"This movie is without doubt the best animated movie of all time. The artistry was perfect. I was spellbound at the animated sequences to the songs ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" especially. The characters were very well drawn, and because of the dark and colourful backgrounds, the film looked beautiful. The songs are fantastic. Another movie with great songs is ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""(which has the best beginning to a Disney movie). In fact, all the Alan Menken scores are brilliant, with the exception of Home On The Range, which is one of the weaker Disney efforts. My personal favourites, were the songs I just mentioned, and ""Gaston"" was great fun too. The incidental music was the best in any Disney movie, and that is the same with the other Menken scores. The music in the transformation of the Beast was phenomenal, as well as the animation, and reminded me of the last movement of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which is really frightening. Another Disney with great incidental music is ""The Lion King"". The story is quite simply one of the best love stories ever, and the characters are wonderful. Belle was voiced beautifully by Paige O'Hara, who has a beautiful singing voice. I love Belle, she is beautiful, clever and strong, and is one of the best Disney characters for those reasons. Gaston was made into a complex villain, and quite narcissistic(great idea Disney). When he was nasty he was quite frightening, and Richard White can really sing. Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers were really entertaining as Lumiere and Cogsworth,(I just love how witty, elegant and debonair Lumiere is) and Angela Lansbury gives a brilliant rendition of the title song. The best voice over was that of the Beast, who was very frightening, and there were some parts that were truly sensitive. Why are some people fussed about him as a human? Remember, true beauty comes from within. In conclusion, an essential to your Disney collection with a very poignant ending. 10/10. Bethany Cox"
"Words fail me as I try to express my feelings about Beauty and the Beast, the best cartoon movie ever made! Praise is all that I can find for it and anything that I or any fan writes about it simply cannot do justice to this tour-de-force of top-class animation and elegant story-telling.Beauty and the Beast marks one of the first and best uses of digital animation for the range of human emotions that it captures. Even today, there is no sequence as memorable as the ballroom sequence where Belle and the Beast dance to the strains of the title tune. Speaking of tunes, no mention of this movie's artistic merits is ever complete without a mention of the songs. The lyrics written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are absolutely poetic (Tale as old as time/Song as old as rhyme) and the voicing of the songs by Angela Lansbury, Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson and others is simply incredible!The two best song sequences in the movie are 'Be My Guest' and 'Tale as old as time'. The script is excellent taking the old but fairly well-known fable and developing it into something modern yet touching and poignant. The new innovations of the scriptwriters to the original story such as putting a feminist touch on Belle, the development of the relationship between Belle and the Beast, the talking cutlery are fully fleshed out and have been integrated into the pace, moving the story forward and never slowing it down. The characters are sharply developed. Belle is a vibrant bookish girl who lives in a world of fairy tales, yet dearly loves her wacky but likable inventor father. Also it is worth mentioning that she is shown to have an individualistic bent of mind who sees the handsome but shallow Gaston for what he is and spurns his advances. She has the spunk to wear the type of clothes and act the way she wants unlike the other dumb village girls.At first she fears the Beast, but when he saves her she appreciates him and finds the prince within the Beast. She is intelligent, compassionate and has a mind of her own. She's also very outspoken and courageous as is evidenced by her opting to take her father's place in the Beast's castle and in her tirade of reason against the Beast when he rebukes her for putting herself into danger by trying to run away from the castle. With her strong personality, she makes a terrific role model for young girls everywhere. Long before Titanic, this was the first successful attempt at female empowerment. The Beast is a fierce ape-like creature whose short temper stems from his frustration at being unable to find true love. Gaston the narcissistic village champion who thinks that brawns are more important than brains is ridiculed by the movie and eventually exposed as its villain. Even minor supporting characters such as the clock, the lamp and the teapot are fleshed out and will enchant both kids and adults alike.I actually started crying during the movie's finale when the Beast dies after the struggle with Gaston and my sorrow was turned into joy when the curse is broken and the Beast gets transformed into a handsome prince. The transformation effects are simply mind-blowing (for a cartoon movie!).Some eighteen years after its release this movie only gets better with time. Cynics who normally dismiss cartoons and G-rated fare should see this movie and experience a change of heart. If this movie does not move them, then they should go admit themselves into a morgue!My Grade:A+!"
"wow,this is amazing,and one of the best Disney's movies.I believe Beauty and the beast,Pocahontas and The little mermaid are the peak of all of the Disney's movies.how great it shows love,humanity,abomination and so on. And the songs are just wonderful,specially ""Beauty and the beast"".when this movie was made I was just 2 years old,when I watched this movie I was only 10 and now I'm 18 but still count it as my favorite movie. and this is the best dialog of the movie: Cogsworth: Well Your Highness, I must say everything is going just swimmingly. I knew you had it in you, ha ha! Beast: I let her go. Cogsworth: Yes, yes, - You... what? How could you do that? Beast: I had to. Cogsworth: Yes, but, but... but... why? Beast: Because... I love her."
"This is Disney's greatest achievement. From the first shot of the castle right on to the end view of the stain glass window it is funny, frightening, and powerful. Every shot is even more enchanting and fantastic than the last. Walt Disney would be very proud of this film.Howard Ashman and Alan Menken have done what most composers can only dream of. To create a ""script"" in every lyric and every note that is heard. This film is nothing short of spectacular.Every voice is flawless. Robby Benson in particular reminds us all that you do not have to be in front of the camera to give off a believable and touching performance.The film is Oscar worthy in every way. The viewer would be well advised to bring a box of tissues during some of the films more tender moments. The ballroom scene is an example of how seamless the animation really is. Other tearjerker moments include a fight between Belle and The Beast which ends with the Beast leaving the protection of his castle to rescue the one who could break the spell from a pack of savagely monstrous wolves, the transformation of a monster into a man, and a dedication to the late Howard Ashman. You too will fall instantly under the spell of this beautiful story. If there is ever anything you will miss out on don't let this movie be it."
"**CONTAINS PLOT REFERENCES AND SOME SPOILERS**Before approaching Beauty and the Beast it is worth mentioning that this is a movie which Disney himself had always intended to make before his death. The finished product I should imagine would fail to disappoint even he himself the most intimidating of perfectionists.What separates this particular Disney offering from the usual litany of animated boy meets girl stories previously is the particularly deft and mature characterisation. We have always come to expect charming and technically leading animation from Disney, but the characters themselves are what sets this movie apart as a jewel in the studio's crown.Belle is a truly contemporary and cerebral heroine, beset by a life that offers little to her aspiring imagination and intelligence. The small village in which she lives with her father seems to be a place in which she does not fit. She is looked upon as a crank because her passion is reading. Her father is viewed as insane because of his quirky inventions.Beast is by far the most deep and complex Disney character to date. He is not a perfect prince, far from it- but rather a fallen man, and the product of his own misfortune. Filled with bitterness and cynicism, he exists in a damned world of his own creation and must endure the limbo that surrounds him as a result of his selfish choices in life. Pride has led to his great fall and hope has deserted him. From the outside the viewer feels the plight of both of the lead characters and it is a joy to watch both characters come together, not in the usual Disney formula of a magic kiss, but a real relationship with real pitfalls and real emotional challenges.We witness lonely bookworm Belle finding that books can not be judged by their cover, finding a true friend for the first time in her life, and ultimately true love. Beast's gradual redemption ensues and he discovers the error of his ways, and abandons his defences and even his sense of self in order to truly love Belle.The music delights and the animation charms with a surrounding plethora of delightful supporting characters which appeal to both children and adults alike. Villain and all round sexist boor Gaston adds some comic relief and grotesque cave-man charm in his desire for Belle whom he views as another beautiful hunting trophy for the wall of his lodge.The musical aspect of the movie is astoundingly well written and performed. Each song lends something unique to the movie as a whole without detracting or seeming unintuitive to the storyline.One of the most charming things about this movie is that its French origins have not been eliminated by Disney, but incorporated into a colourful backdrop for a story that will stand the test of time.This movie has so many personal high points for me that I wish I could mention them all. It contains one of the greatest pieces of animation I have ever seen in the Beast's transformation at the end of the film. Beast emerges from his seeming demise magically and changes to his staggeringly beautiful human form almost resembling Michaelangelo's David emerging from the marble. This ending is a fitting climax to a great work of both animation and storytelling.In conclusion this is an unmissable slice of classic animation, served up so beautifully that future generations will keep coming back for more. Beauty and the Beast was well deserving of it's Best Picture nomination, for here at last is a Disney story which will stand the test of time and melt the heart of even the most cynical beast.10/10"
"I agree with the commentator who mentioned that we should ""live the fairy tale"" because Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful story that teaches the viewer not to judge a book by its cover. This movie is my favorite movie of all time because so much of it applies to myself. I am very much a bookworm, and I used to keep to myself a lot. Eventually, I met my prince and am now living happily ever after. I hope that everyone can live this way or live the fairy tale. A lot of Belle's attributes are worthy of praise: intelligence, kindness and bravery. At a young age, I was taught to value these characteristics and to incorporate them into my own personality. It is probably these three attributes that my friends like about me, therefore Belle is an excellent example of a role model, especially for young girls. She also teaches everyone, and not just children, that perserverence pays off in the end with love and happiness. The objects/servants are a colorful lot, much like your friends, family and everyday acquaintances. They add color and meaning to your life and offer humor: the best medicine. Overall, the scenery and the animation are incredible. I especially loved the details in the castle! It is no surprise that the movie was nominated for an Academy award. 10 stars out of 10 =)"
"In the opening of Beauty and The Beast, we find out more about the characters in the first five minutes, then many movies tell us in half an hour.  Taking a risk, and opening an animated film with a long musical number was a risky move, but as it turns out, a perfectly wonderful idea. From the opening to the end, we are totally captivated by this wonderful achievement in music and animation as we have never been before.Unlike many animated Disney movies where a song may be thrown in here and there, and do little to move the story along, each song here is directly related to the story line, moves the movie along, and leaves us anticipating the next big number.  Alan Menken and Howard Ashman deserve every bit of the praise they received for this film, and then some.All the characters in this film are so well animated and voiced, you never once think about the fact that you are watching an animated movie, as is often the case.  From the town that Belle lives in, to the Beast castle, the backgrounds are beautifully rendered in detail, and vibrant alive colors. In 1991, this was a ground breaking, animated film, and over ten years later, as much as I enjoy many of the new computer animated movies such as Shrek and Toy Story, none has come close to the accomplishments of Beauty and the Beast, which mixes romance, music, comedy and drama, in a perfect blend that may never be seen again."
"This movie is pure magic. I love Disney films, especially the traditionally animated ones. I sincerely hope that does not become a lost art form.So, first point for the movie: it's French. I adore the language and the culture, so getting a smattering is a delight.Secondly, it's a classic fairytale that is also quite dark. There is much tragedy woven into to castle and its surroundings. I like best the tales that aren't overly bubbly, and this one keeps the goofiness down pretty well.Next, the heroine actually possesses some intelligence! She reads and has her own mind, and, unlike many, is flawed. It's nice that the film was taken seriously enough to have some dimension, even if it was ""only"" an animated movie. Plus, I really want to have her library someday.Lastly- the movie is just so beautiful! The castle and the woods were gorgeous, the ballroom was beautiful, but the best was the breathtaking scene right after Belle dumps Gaston and runs out to the field behind her house. Sheer perfection. No wonder this movie was nominated for best picture. My only wish- I would have liked to have seen some more of the Beast as Adam. He was pretty cute!Quote of the Film:Well YOU shouldn't have been in the West Wing!"
"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, in my opinion, is a delightful Disney romance. If you ask me, Gaston (voice of Richard White) was truly diabolical. Still, in my opinion, he was very good-looking. On the other hand, the songs were truly superior. Well, despite the fact that every song in this film was good, I would have to say that the title song was the best. This was probably be because she did most of the singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in delightful Disney romance to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
"This is the best movie/cartoon i've ever seen! I just love it! I watched this movie 20 or more times I think. The songs are terrific. The dress of Belle is absolutely amazing, isn't it? :) The little cup of tea is really sweet. I think the voices suit really good for all characters. I would like to see ""Beauty and the Beast on Ice"" but for now it's really impossible. I think that who saw this show is really really lucky! ""Transformation"" part of this movie is good enough and I think you should pay attention the music because Disney orchestra is terrific playing the music. Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast!!! I don't like Celine Dion and her voice either but Peabo Bryson sings very well. He just showed his talent! The new part of show in special edition is good enough. I just love the song."
"by Ashley Chewning.The movie The Beauty and The Beast is a heart-warming production by the Disney family. The movie was about Belle (Paige 0' Hara) who was trying to make a beast (Robby Benson) very lovable for him to change back with his friends: Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansburg), Chip (Bradely Pierce), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers, who is also the narrator for the movie), Wardrobe (Jo Anne Worley), Bergman or Babette (Mary Kay), and the stove (Brian Cummings). If the beast and his friends don't change back before the last rose petal falls, then they would stay like that forever.I thought that The Beauty and The Beast was a very good movie. I thought it was dramatic because there was a lot of fire that threatened the Beast and other people. There were many scenes that made the movie action-packed. For an example, at the end of the movie Gaston (Richard White) and the beast fought with each other at the top of the castle. I thought that was a cool thing to watch.The romantic part was the best part out of the whole movie. It all started at the dance in the middle of the ballroom floor. The song came on and they were dancing and having fun. Then it went to near the end of the movie when the Beast and his friends turn back to normal, and Belle and the Beast live happily ever after.I think that this movie would be good to watch with a family member or with your best friends."
"While loving Disney may seem a bit, childish for a high school teen, I would like to say this movie just pushes my lack of care even more.The narrator that starts the movie does a wonderful job of describing the beginning, which cuts right into a song which Belle sings. Not only is the music beautiful, but the characters are creative and full of personality. What really makes this movie stand out from others is the voice acting, brilliant! Angela Lansbury, Page O'Hara, Robby Benson, Jerry Orbach, and many more.The reason I think this movie is so great, is the fact that the story, music, colors, characters, and voice acting blend so well, it is hard to find fault with this movie. This is THE BEST ANIMATED MOVIE TO DATE!"
"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I was three when I first saw it in the theater and didn't realize at the time how good it really was. I was just one of those kids dancing in the aisle during ""Be Our Guest"". But recently I watched it again after learning that it was nominated for Best Picture. In the first three minutes I thought, ""I can see why"". The opening song is a masterpiece. It tells of an entire history of the characters and what they think of each other in three and a half minutes. Once again we see Howard Ashman's gift for writing lyrics that the animators gain a lot of their inspiration from. Gaston (the villain) starts off as the butt of every joke. Then he begins to become a monster and finally a murderer. This is by far the villain that goes through the biggest change throughout the film. The ending of the film is very moving. With the Beast transforming into the prince. This film also was the first one to have successful use of computer animation. The ballroom scene in which the Beast and Belle finally fall in love is very deep. There is two versions of the title song. One for the credits performed by Peobo Bryson and Celine Dion and one that Ms. Lansbury sings during the dancing sequence. Both may require several boxes of tissues. I still believe that this film is perfect in every way."
"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today!"
"This is the most amazing movie i have ever seen. Everything about it is magnificent. The music goes perfect with the scenes and mood of the film, and the characters have personalities that go with the flow of the movie. Every event leads to another one and keeps you watching. I cant even describe the overall feeling after you watch it. It will make you feel every emotion there is. There are parts where you will be angry at the movie, but another when u are happy and over joyed and yet, sad and crying your eyes out. The old story of a young girl finding the true beauty within from a beast is captured very well. It can be told anyway but Disney really makes it the best. The animation is still beautiful even now when they have higher technology. Overall even know it is still my favorite movie and i do watch it every time i get a chance. I am practically obsessed it is so good. I do have other favorites like the little mermaid and Tarzan and the lion king but nothing can compare to this.Every time i see it i am taken away into it until the end. I always wish that this story could somehow come true and i could be there. It makes you dream and wish and hope. The strong scenes for me are: -when the prince is just transformed into the beast and with the rose as the camera zooms away from the castle. -after Gaston proposes to belle and she runs out of the house asking for a more ""provincial life"" and lays in the grass -the library scene -and definitely the ballroom scene just fills me with joy and tears at the same time -and lastly when the beast is dying and belle mutters that she loves himWhat really makes it the best is the voices too. Just listening to hte music without the movie can make you feel the same way. i am a real Disney lover but i would highly recommend this one above all others."
"This is the best movie of all times.This movie came out in 1991, It has since produced 2 other movies to compliment it. I love this movie so much that I have started my own collect.If you have ever wondered what true love can be like this movie is for you. It gives you hope when you are down. I love it.I have seen this movie many many times and I can't get enough. I saw this movie as a teenager and I have been enchanted again and again. The music in this animation was great. Beauty and the beast won best picture and will for ever be the only one that will ever win this award as an animated movie because it was later given its own category.All of the characters in the film will fill your heart with happiness."
"My favourite Disney film, made in the last great era of the company, before the new wave of technologically advanced films came along. This era included Aladdin and the Lion King, but it is Beauty and the Beast which comes out on top for its simple story, beautifully told. Based on the classic French fairy tale the story is one of love, understanding, and seeing the true nature of a person, not what is on the surface, and the wonderful characters along with sumptuous animation and timeless songs make this a deserving classic.Belle lives with her old father Maurice, and her horse, just outside a quiet country town. She is shy, would do anything for her father, an inventor, but is lonely, wishing that there is something more than the world she sees everyday. Local hard-man Gaston wants to marry her, but she is not interested. One day Maurice gets lost in a massive forest, and finds shelter in an old castle. There he finds magical creatures, cups and ornaments who can speak. However the castle is owned by a monster who captures Maurice. The beast will only save Maurice if Belle will go to him forever, and Belle sacrifices herself. At first the beast is frightening, but with time they grow to understand each other, eventually falling in love. The beast's curse is that he must have a woman fall in love with him before his magical rose dies, or he will be trapped in that body forever. Years ago he was cursed for not helping an old woman and has become bitter, but Belle changes that. However, Gaston has plans of his own. The film is full of beautiful imagery which will stay with you forever-the rose petals falling, the ballroom dance, and the swooping camera adds a new dimension to the musical score. Seasons change from summer to winter and the animators eye for detail with each change is truly breathtaking. Smaller characters like Chip, Lumiere, Mrs Potts and the clock add to the delightful mood. Only a heart of stone could dislike this movie, and the story is sincere and touching, if a little whimsical. Each song is charming and memorable, and the Oscar is well deserved. Short enough to keep any kid occupied, but older viewers can equally enjoy the romance which is more effectively shown here than in the majority of non-animated features. Watch this and the world doesn't seem so bad. 10 out of 10"
"This movie has been my favorite Disney movie since I was three years old. It is filled with humor, magic, suspense, and heart. It tells the story of a teenaged girl named Belle, whose father Maurice has been captured by a hideous beast, who is actually a selfish prince with a spell put on him. She makes a deal with the beast: The beast releases her father and takes her instead. She eventually warms his cold heart, and the two fall in love. But, a selfish man named Gaston, who has been in love with Belle, doesn't approve, and his plans almost prevail in an excellent climax. The title song ""Beauty and the Beast"" performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is classic. I would highly recommend this movie, even to adults, because it is sure to touch all who see it. 10/10."
"I absolutely love this movie.  I have to disagree with some of the people who said not to see it on IMAX...  I saw it on IMAX, and yes, it's more expensive, but I really enjoyed it.  It allowed me to see a lot of details that I didn't notice before, good and bad.  The only bad part was at the end where people are standing still while Belle and the Prince are dancing... but that wasn't a big deal to me.  I thought watching it on IMAX was great, but it's probably better if you've seen the movie before because you'd appreciate it more seeing it on the super-huge screen."
"This film, from it's opening narration, to the end credits, is a beautifully animated adaptation of a well known classic.When I first saw this, I was captivated by both the animation and the story. It's a nice tale, and as always, has something to teach us.
The songs are really great too. Every one in this movie, is beautifully sung and well orchestrated. Everyone knows the song ""Be our guest"" and it brings a smile to my face every time I hear/see it.The villain of the piece is of course Mr Universe with his bulging biceps and pearly white teeth, and we as an audience can't wait for the inevitable confrontation between him and the Beast.But to me, the real star of this film is Mrs Potts (Angela Lansbury). She sings THAT song wonderfully, and sends a shiver down my back, and brings a tear to my eye every time!!This is, I must say, Disney at their best, they don't make them like this anymore, and it shows that when people care about something that they make, it'll all work out, and everyone will be happy ever after.10/10Enjoy!"
"While just about everyone is bragging about how great Lord of the Rings is and how its now their favorite film and best film of all time, they certainly forgot the real movies like Beauty and the Beast. This movie has some of the best music and best animation I have ever seen. When you see this on the IMAX, it is almost a whole new experience seeing this movie on film. Even though it's a re-release, I think it is one of the best movies of the year 2002.10/10"
"this is one of my all time favorite films.  the story is classic and can be related to any time period.  it contains a terrific moral, as well as the most beautiful and wonderful animated creation in all of film.  she also has a wonderful voice, a definite plus.  the music is great as well."
"So in Beauty & The Beast, the Prince is offered a magic rose by a haggard old witch in return for some shelter for the night. The Prince says no and he is turned into a Beast (surprise!) as punishment for his selfish and shallow nature, and the curse will only be lifted if he can get someone to love him before the last rose petal wilts on his 21st birthday.But lets take a closer look at this, shall we?Right at the very end of the film, the last petal falls, and since the film only takes place over a couple of days (thanks to one of the most economical scripts I've ever seen), and the curse has been on the Prince and his servants for 10 years (as Lumiere sings in 'Be Our Guest' – ""Ten years we've been rusting""), I think there is only one thing to take from all this:The Prince was only TEN YEARS OLD when the curse was put on him!No wonder he was scared of the ""old beggar woman"" who came to his castle. He's ten years old, all alone on a dark stormy night, his parents are nowhere to be found, clearly his servants are neglecting him as well as he had to answer the door himself, and he confronted with a hideous old crone. What ten year old wouldn't be scared by that?!And then he has to find love as a beast when he wasn't even old enough to have had a chance to develop any understanding of love as a human! No wonder he's been so angry all these years.Think about that next time you watch."
"The story goes something like this: A prince is cruel, and rejects an old woman's rose in return for shelter. She's really an enchantress. She turns him into a beast, and placed a magic spell on everything and everyone in the castle. He then secludes himself in his home, with a magic mirror as the only view to outside the castle. The rose will bloom until he turns 21--pretty young for a prince, eh? He needed a girl to fall in love with, and get her to love him back, then it would be all good. And if not, he's doomed to stay as a beast forever and ever. The narration--by David Ogden Stiers, who plays Cogsworth--was great, and really like ""...for who could ever learn to love a beast?"" The next scene, we meet a young girl named Belle, a very beautiful but very odd girl, because she always likes to read, and is somewhat of an outcast, like her father, Maurice. The song 'Belle', which is a great song, really shows how much she's different from everyone else, and that she wants more out of life than just her small, poor French town. And really, don't we all want more out of life? A man, Gaston, the town 'hunk', wants to woo Belle, while his oddball sidekick, Lefou, doesn't think that she's the best of the best, as opposed to Gaston. Belle knows that he's handsome, but 'rude and conceited' as well, and not for her. As she gets home to help Maurice, who's working on what could possibly the weirdest machine made to chop wood. At least it works, and he takes it to the fair.He and his horse Philippe trot off to the fair, but they get lost. Men and their direction skills. That last statement was just a stereotypical thing, because we see it happen often. So they take the dark, gloomy road that Maurice wants to go, rather than the safe, light road that Philippe wants to take. Maurice should've listened to the horse. But of course, then there would be no story. Maurice then realizes that it's not right, and as usual, blames Philippe for it, because no one wants to take the blame for something that they did wrong. They get chased by a pack of wolves, Philippe gets away, and Maurice ends up in the castle where the Beast lives, but he doesn't know that. When he gets in, we get introduced to Cogsworth and Lumiere, the clock and candelabra, who are pretty much opposites, and Lumiere's welcome eventually wins over Cogsworth's attitude to get Maurice out. Lumiere makes him comfortable and Mrs. Potts and Chip, a teapot and teacup, serve him tea, and then the scary part comes. Enter the Beast. Maurice gets taken to a prison.The next day, Gaston tries to get Belle to marry him, but our heroine knows better, and works a way to get him out, and she finds Philippe, who amazingly tells Belle in some form or way that Maurice is gone. They try to find him, and immediately Philippe wants to leave, but Belle keeps him steady. She goes inside the castle to find him. As she searches, the servants in the castle see her, thinking that she's the one who can break the spell. Lumiere and Cogsworth try to remain inconspicuous, and Belle finds her father, and the Beast finds them. Belle then makes the sacrifice of her life: she takes her father's place, and promises to stay forever, after seeing the Beast. She feels terrible and without a goodbye, Maurice is taken back to the village. Belle is told that she can go anywhere in the castle except the west wing, because it's forbidden. She is told that she must join the Beast for dinner that night. She then finds out that everything is enchanted,and she is stunned. She decides she's not going to go to dinner. After finding out she's not coming down, the feud between the two of them grows. When Belle comes down to eat, Lumiere starts to sing 'Be Our Guest', and it is entertaining! After the number, Belle is taken by Lumiere and Cogsworth for a tour and Belle stumbles upon the stairs that lead to the west wing. She tricks them into taking themselves to the library, and ventures into the forbidden zone. She sees some peculiar things, but she then sees the most intriguing object of all: the rose. She wants to touch it, but is caught by the Beast, who scares her away from the castle. The Beast saves her from death by wolves.The Beast and Belle dance with Mrs. Potts singing 'Beauty and the Beast', and it makes their bond so much better. Belle realizes that her father is sick, and the Beast releases her, because he loves her. The town find out about the Beast, and try to kill him. The servants fight back, in a hilarious battle, while Gaston goes in for the Beast. The Beast and Gaston fight each other, and Belle returns for the Beast, but right as they reach for each other, Gaston stabs the Beast, but then karma gets back at him and he falls to his doom. Belle tries to keep the Beast with her, but it seems too late. She whispers to him, ""I love you,"" right before the last pedal falls. The spell is broken, just in time. Sparks fall from the sky, and the Beast resumes his original form, and they kiss. The castle returns to normal, and it's all good.Deserved the Best Picture nomination and it is one of the best Disney movies in my mind."
"Beauty and the Beast is truly the best animated movie of all time. Tonight I watched again after 4 or 5 years and it just opened my eyes. If all of my brothers weren't watching it with me I would have cried so much. The story is incredible, but what really makes this movie so wonderful and beautiful is the music. The songs are great, especially "" Beauty and the Beast"", Alan Menken did a great job on this movie( Songs and score). I'm very happy that it won 2 Oscars, and got nominated for best picture, I think it should have won. Beauty and the Beast is a movie for all ages, it will make you happy when you're child, and make you cry when you're older. In conclusion, I believe that this movie is one of the greatest ever made and I'm surprised it's not in IMDb's top 250 'cause it really should be, anyway, to all of you who still didn't get the chance to see it or thought that it was to silly and childish, believe me it's not, it's a true masterpiece. I love it!!! And I know you will. 10/10"
"Iv'e heard the comment before and I definitely would never believe it.Classic Disney Films have a certain unbeatable magic that gives you such an emotional feeling if your like me, and I would never say that these movies are just for children.Think about it about 75% of Classic Disney movies (im not talking about the emperor's new groove, Hercules, etc) I'm talking about Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Alladin, The Lion King, Bambi, Snow white, The little Mermaid, and Pochahontas, are all romances (or have a portion of romantic moments.When I was little I loved those movies so much (I grew up a Disney baby I'm now 13) because they were colorful, bright, happy, fun, and magical, but somehow they mean even more to me to this day.Beauty and the Beast has definitely become my favorite Disney film (I also love Aladdin, the lion king, Bambi and the others I mentioned VERY much).It's easy for me to understand now and there's something about Disney that now means so much more to me.It's not just about fairytale princesses and fun animated little objects, Beauty and the Beast is a beautiful tale of romance and acceptance.Showing you that love comes from the heart, not the eyes.I cry every time I watch it because the significance has an amazing effect on me and my entire family.This movie (and many other classic Disney productions) is a masterpiece and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool, this movie is beautiful, original, and very heartwarming so anyone that says Disney films are for children can't appreciate the message they really send out, just because they're animations and not some sick bloody gross-out horror movie or crude sexual comedy or blow up action film, it doesn't make them childish.It makes them meaningful by their stories not their appearance, just like the whole theme of Beauty and the Beast ;-)"
"This animated masterpiece is and will always stay one of the best romantic movies ever created.This is one of those rare movies in which everything comes perfectly together. The characters, the music, the humor, the pace, the story everything in this movie is just perfect. It's a highly memorable movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.The movie is beautifully animated and it features some of the best Disney characters. Mrs. Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere and of course Belle and the Beast are highly memorable and very well constructed characters. Also the villain role Gaston which is always one of the most important elements of a Disney movie is a good one. However the villain isn't as prominent to the story as in most other Disney animated movies is the case. This movie truly is about love and the beauty inside. The movie its love story is nicely supported by the very good songs composed by Alan Menken and with lyrics by Howard Ashman. Unfortunately this was Howard Ashman's last project and he died before he could receive his well deserved Oscar for this movie. Unique fact is that this movie was also even nominated for the 'Best Picture' Oscar. Something that was really well deserved by the way. The story is quite 'mature' but also there is still plenty to enjoy for the little one's here. The movie is filled with lots of humor and imaginative characters. The movie is told in very good quick pace and features some of the best editing I have ever seen in an animated movie.The voice cast consists out of some good actors; Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach are especially perfect for their roles.The movie features some unforgettable classic moments and is a milestone in animated movie making. An highly recommendable animated romantic movie that shall always remain one of the best romantic movies ever made. This movie is recommendable to everyone, even those who normally don't like romantic stories and movies, thrust me, you'll love this movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Out of Disney's 4 golden age movies, Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Lion King, and this one, Beauty and the Beast is easily the best. The animation is beautiful, the music is hauntingly good, the story is a classic and the characters are unforgettable. It all comes together as Disney's best animated film to date. The remake doesn't hold a candle to it."
"Just rewatched Beauty and the Beast with my movie theatre-working friend at where he works. This was actually my first time seeing it on the big screen and in 3-D, to boot! What can I say except after 20 years, it's still one of the most wonderful of the animated Disney fairy tales to be depicted in movies. No wonder it was the first of its kind to be nominated an Oscar for Best Picture. And the songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman like ""Belle"", ""Be Our Guest"", and the title song were also worthy of the nominations with the last one deserving of the win. And those voices, ah, what voices! I mean, Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), and Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts) just make the picture perfect with their line readings and singing. The last one, especially, when singing the already mentioned title song which would also be lovingly rendered by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson during the end credits. Really, all I'll say now is Beauty and the Beast gets a very high recommendation from me. P.S. I also loved the dedication at the very end ""To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman (1950-1991)""."
"This was the very first film I have ever seen in my whole life. I remember my Mom taking me to the theaters in 1991 (I was four at the time) to see this movie. This is no ordinary family movie; in fact, I think that this is the best family movie ever made. I am always excited whenever I see this movie. Heck, in March 2003, I bought the DVD of this movie so that I can finally own my favorite old-school Disney movie! That's how much I love ""Beauty and the Beast."" I miss all the great stuff that Disney used to put out at the time; I spent pretty much all of my childhood growing up with this kind of Disney entertainment! Now, we have mostly dull stuff from 2002 onwards, but some of it (like ""National Treasure,"" for instance) is still good! Please, make this movie your favorite Disney movie now!"
"This timeless fairy tale has been reworked to respond to specific gender preoccupations of the day. Disney's Beauty and the Beast addresses the contest between two types of masculinity, aggressive and gentle, targeting young boys to socialize into the new sensitive male of the 90s. The representation of femininity plays a minor part in the story.Because Disney films are targeted to a younger audience, the sexual implication of the `Beast' is replaced with a coarse, boorish and unrefined type of masculinity. This film is about the socialization of young boys, and the audience learns through textual analysis what behavior the film deems appropriate. The Beast is 11 when he is put under the spell and 21 by the time it is broken, which covers the formative years of the transition from boyhood to manhood. The most obvious lesson he has to learn is to love, and to be good enough to have that love returned. Heterosexual love sets everything right and is the definition of the manhood he has to attain. The rest of the film reads as a transcript of proper behavior, and Lumiere, the dating etiquette expert, is his teacher. The Beast is expected to find more suitable accommodations than the dungeon, walk Belle to her door, say something to fill the awkward space on the trip to her room, and invite her to dinner. As a man, he is expected to control his temper, eat in a civilized manner, and learn gentleness with the birds. In the scene depicting his table manners, Belle switches from the role of date to that of nurturing, instructive mother. Belle recognizes his effort with the spoon and compromises with him by sipping her broth from the bowl. All of the characters have a part in his instruction. Especially informative is the scene when Belle sings about how he was course and unrefined, and now he is dear to her because he is unsure. It is the self consciousness and insecurity, in eating and getting dressed in bows, that sets the Beast apart from Gaston and makes him the ideal 90s (less masculine) man. In fact he has physical prowess but he represses it, and appeals instead to Belle's mind with the library. The film reassures boys that one can be both gentle and manly. The key to winning the girl lays in his evolution; he overcomes his selfishness. The Disney film leaves no room for competing versions of masculinity. Only one would survive; the bad guy dies.Gaston and the Beast are quite similar rivals, analogous in their social worlds. Either the entire town or all of the appliances cheer their respective protagonist. Gaston is beastly as shown by his shadows, bestial shape, and pride that every last inch of him is `covered in hair.' Their fight in the tower marks the emotional high point of the film and is essentially a rivalry between two types of masculinity. The sensitive male that the audience has witnessed evolving, or the 100% pure testosterone laden Gaston who is aggressive, has a thick neck, eats to excess, is not an intellectual (he knocks over a chess table) and is a model to which all those in the village aspire to. Belle drops out of the equation entirely, as the major lesson of the film is the contest between two versions of manhood, with the sensitive male of the 90s the victor.To a lesser degree, the film is also about the new woman of the 90s. Belle is the new heroine that Disney produced, though she is just as skinny and wide eyed as the heroines before her. She does read books, but they are fairy tales and her idea of `something more than this provincial life' is prince charming. She is really not all that intellectual. She does have two physical saving scenes, when the Beast is attacked by wolves, and before he falls off the tower and she catches him. However, overshadowing Disney's attempt to create a modern, liberated woman, Belle ends up faced with a choice that is really no choice at all. She has to get married in the end whether it is to one man or another.Belle simply settles for the best type of masculinity, what she a `new woman' is looking for in a `new man.' She has little choice, since she doesn't like Gaston and she does want to get married. The lesson is that one type of masculinity not only triumphs and survives, but it also gets the girl. It is surprising that a more recent film, after the women's movement, and one self-consciously trying to create a new heroine, actually takes more power out of the female's hands then older versions of the tale. Animations oftentimes reinforces stereotypes, and the `happily ever after' genre conflicts with any real independence Belle could have shown, resulting in no choice other than marriage."
"This is possibly the greatest animated film ever made. That's right, the greatest. Although, more artistically adept Anime fans may detest and although 'The Lion King' is traditionally realized as the quintessential animated film, 'Beauty and the Beast', in the indiscriminate animated realm, may very possibly be one of the most important animated films, Disney, Animated, or otherwise, ranking alongside the likes of 'Snow White', 'Toy Story', and 'Fantasia'. First of all, let's talk about the cinematography. I declare there is not a single shot in this film that does not impress me. Prior to this film's completion, Rescuers Down Under had enjoyed the distinction of being the first full length animated feature in CGI. But, Beauty is the film that perfected it. Even with all of the animated films that have come since the release of Beauty, I am struck by the polished clarity of the animation in that the background and its objects remain completely in focus in proportion to the objects in the forefront, as critics are still astounded today that young Charles Foster Kane playing in the snow is able to remain in focus through a window in proportion to Agnes Moorhead in 'Citizen Kane.' Likewise, look at Belle and the Beast's snowball fight in 'Something There' while the objects converse. Belle and the Beast, from a distance, can be clearly viewed as easily as can the objects. When Maurice runs down the staircase of the cottage before the angry mob, the camera flies down following him, and yet Belle and Monsieur D'Arque remain completely visible. Remarkable shots like these can be found throughout the film, such as the Swooping Ballroom Ceiling Scene, the wolf chase, and the Beast's transformation sequence. It is understandable that Walt Disney gave up on his treatment of 'Beauty,' just as it is understandable that the makers of this film almost gave up on its completion. The story does not scream success (a beautiful girl passively sacrificing her life for her father and falling in love with a cursed beast). And, yet it is a testament to the power of storytelling that this film is as entertaining as it is, for a film without a straightout villain or hero. From the start, we are taken from a haunted castle, paranormal in its scope, to a simple French village bustling with activity, and the film never loses its power. The film's only legitimate weakness is its instrumental score. Following the fantastic score of 'Mermaid' and preceding the wonderful score to 'Aladdin' and the riveting score to 'The Lion King,' the score to 'Beauty' holds few surprises, for the most part. Otherwise, this is a film devoid of weakness and, more importantly, scandal (like most of the other ""Renaissance"" films). And whatever I could say about the film's wonderful and groundbreaking songs, characters, scenery, and detail has likely already been said. All I can do is recommend this as highly as any great film I have ever seen."
"Before any hate comments I like to point out like I said in the title, it's a classic and I like it. It has a good story, great animation, wonderful music etc. but after reading the plot of Beauty and the Beast book on Wikipedia I think it could've worked better. In the original, Belle is one of the six children in a wealthy merchant family, now you might think she'll be bratty or selfish and all that clichéd stuff but really she sounds very nice and kind, as of course Disney had adopted the personality into the movie so credit for that. Though the sisters really have that 'ugly step sister' appeal like from Cinderella treating Belle like a servant and secretly taunt her. The merchant lost his wealth in a storm and was forced to live in a small farmhouse. Years later, the merchant, found out that one of his ships had survived the causality and returned to the city to find out in the end that wealth has been seized to pay off his debt. Beforehand, thinking that the ship might have something valuable promised his daughters some jewels and dresses and Belle a rose, which is from the beast's garden, more of the plot can be seen on Wikipedia. The book's plot pretty much works better then Disney's adaptation and as I said before, the movie is a classic. But I love stories that has also have no villains, Gaston is a really memorable villain, not plotting revenge or wanting to kill someone, well minus beast so he can win Belle, but not for glory. He's just pompous, self-centred person. But films like 'My Neighbour Totoro' works without a villain, it's shows the struggle of the main character. As much as I love this film and its story, the book version would've been a better choice to adapt. As of the movie. I love the side characters and climax, and I do accept the Disney version by the way. The songs are fun and the animation very fluid and colourful."
"This is in short the most magical movie, Disney has ever put out. I have watched it so many times and every time it just feels equally or more magical. The songs are perfect, the animation is perfect, the villain is not the ""evil-just-for-being-evil"", but realistically motivated to do bad things which fits the movie perfectly. And finally, the romance between Belle and beast are among the most real and beautiful ever done by Disney if not the best.The story is definitely a tale as old as time."
"Along with Lion King and Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast is widely considered by most as Disney's finest film. That is simply a completely fair observation considering how good everything about the film is.The film follows the story of a man who was turned into a beast by a witch after he failed to help her due to her hideous appearance and a sweet young lady named Belle. As Belle is held prisoner by the Beast, both begin to discover what each other are deep down. Why do I absolutely love this film? Simply said, I love everything about the film. I love the voice acting, I love the classical animations, I love the story itself and the characters and also find the songs surprisingly good! This film has a magical taste to it. It just has this sweetness to it that many film nowadays attempt to accomplish but obviously fail, most notably Twilight. The relationship between Beauty and the Beast works so well during the film and it also adds a lot of comedy to it. I loved the pacing of the film and find that this is one of the most enjoyable movies of all time!"
"I finally have a legitimate excuse to review this movie. One of the great ones. One of the greatest animated masterpieces of all time. There's no real reason to hate on this movie; it really is a gem. It's been talked about to death that all I can hope to do is bring my own opinion to the table.The story is still good. It's perfectly paced and excellently executed. The best scenes involve Belle and the Beast falling in love. One of the best elements in the movie is the romance. Unlike most Disney romances where the couple meets, falls in love, and gets married a few days later, Beauty and the Beast takes its time. You never know how long it takes the couple to fall in love; it could be weeks, maybe even months, so its open for debate and allows the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions. The characters are still memorable. Belle is beautiful (duh, the title tells you that), but she never flaunts it. She is constantly taunted and mocked, but does she care? No. On top of that, she's smart, kind, and anything else you look for in a Disney princess. The Beast is drawn great and you do believe he's evolved throughout the course of the film. Gaston is one of the best villains of all time. I love how egocentric he is, and when he doesn't get his way, he becomes this vengeful, hateful person. His transformation is just as believable as the Beasts.The side characters...do I need to say anything about these guys? You all remember the quick-witted Lumière, the snobby Cogsworth, the gentle Ms. Potts, and the hilariously stupid LeFou. They're all memorable and I don't need to say anymore about them.I guess I'll talk about the things that I don't like about the film. The first thing is the design of the human version of the Beast, or as Disney so persistently calls him, Adam. It looks goofy and unlike Disney males of the past. Adam looks very out of place, but that's just nit-picking. The 3-D is another gripe I have with the movie. I did not want to see the movie in 3-D, not because it's not a good film, but because I own the movie. Why would I want to pay $13.50 for a ticket when I could pop it into my DVD player FOR FREE? But, after the 3-D Re-release of the Lion King, everyone began to praise the 3-D animation. So, I spent the money on the ticket, and within the first 5 minutes of the film, I regretted it. The 3-D isn't a cheap conversion like The Last Airbender or Clash of the Titans, as I am told that Disney put a lot of money into re-releasing the movie in 3-D. But still, the movie is so clearly NOT shot in 3-D that it just doesn't look good. The opening shot in the forest looked great, but that's it.Final verdict: Though I don't think the movie is worth seeing in 3-D, still take your kids to see it. The animation, the characters, the story, and the music is perfect. It's a better alternative than something like The Smurfs. Raise your children on stuff like this, parents of America. I hear some theaters show the 2-D version, and by all means, go see that. For the problems I have with the 3-D, I won't deny that it was great seeing this film on the big screen. Do yourself a favor this weekend and go."
"You know, two of the best aspects of Disney's version of Beauty & the Beast, seemed small and insignificant to most, but have stuck with me since I saw this in 1991. #1 They freely admit that this is a ""tale as old as time"" – they're not hiding that fact and #2 they're also completely up front with stating ""she's the one"" to break the curse, i.e. they don't make us wait until the end (LIKE MOVIES DO ALL THE TIME) to reveal what we've known from minute one. I respect that.Those are just two things of, I dunno, 50 great things about this near-masterpiece of filmmaking. A beautiful score, fantastic and timeless songs, gorgeous cinematography, hilarious dialogue and ""sidekicks"" and secondary characters, a story very moving, strong leads, adventure, suspense, love, funthis movie is all of those plus so much more.Watching it (for the 20th+ time but) now in the usual-Disney ""We Want Even More of Your Dollars"" way, the re-release, of course in 3D, it still held up for me. My friend and I in the theatre were rocking back and forth with the wonderful musical segments while mouthing the words – trying desperately, albeit probably failing, not to disturb other movie-goers.I will say this, despite my 10/10 Star ratingthe movie did look 21 years old, unfortunately. Some of the background characters did not move while the foreground was in motion. This was, sadly, unintentionally humorous. That said, I am a huge supporter of hand-drawn animation, or, movies people put their heart, soul, sweat & tears in VS clicking the mouse. This was old-school animation and I am fine with that. I just think this was better served, in 2012, at home to appreciate.Sure, I love re-watching classics or even movies I just like a lot, on the silver screen, but this wasn't one of those. Anyone that knows me knows I do like 3D, but I have NOT seen a single Disney 3D movie that impressed me. Especially converted ones. The ONLY good 3D imagery here was the rain & snow, and I said the same thing about The Nightmare Before Christmas's re-release in 3D. Sad, there were a lot more 3D to choose from, but I ONLY liked the rain & snow which, to me, was the only 3D that had depth.So I will NOT recommend this to be seen in theatres. I will NOT go see another Disney Classic on the big screen converted to 3D and I am no longer upset I missed The Lion King's same 3D re-issue last year. I will, however see Finding Nemo's 3D re-release later this year for several reasons: I DO NOT consider that Disney, it's my favorite Pixar film – though I haven't seen it since the original release in 2003 and the less than 2 minute preview before Beauty & the Beast looked far better in 3D than ALL of Beauty & the Beast. (On a side note, it's absolutely easier to convert that – it was 100% digital and computerized.)Stick with this classic on BluRay. I just hope they put that fantastically hilarious Tangled Ever After short (shown before this movie in the theatre.) It was a lot of fun and had us cracking up.For the movie itself: 10/10 Stars. For the 3D conversion: 2/10 Stars."
"Anyone can tell you that 1991's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed animated film from that year, is a modern-day classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a film I saw throughout my childhood growing up in the '90s (I was six when the film was originally released in 1991), and I often regarded it as just another Disney fairy tale movie.Boy, was I wrong.Yes, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is an animated Disney fairy tale, but it's an animated Disney fairy tale like no other. The film came out during a time that is often regarded in film history as the Disney Renaissance period, when the company was putting out top-of-the-line animated features that were of the highest degree of excellence after a nearly-30-year decline in quality, had stellar production values and animation, stellar star/no-name voice talent, and the films were just of overall better quality than in times past. As a result, Disney was beginning to see critical acclaim and box office profits that at the time were unprecedented in the company's history, or animated-film history, for that matter.It supposedly began with ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989) and ended with ""Tarzan"" in 1999 (and I also don't want to forget about 1992's ""Aladdin"" or 1994's ""The Lion King""; ""Beauty and the Beast"" is easily the best film from this time.""Beauty and the Beast"" is of course an adaptation of the classic French fairy tale, and the animation screenplay here (ultimately penned by Linda Woolverton and co-directed by Gary Trousdale & Kirk Wise) is credited to no less than 11 writers. In the film, an unnamed and selfish young prince (Robby Benson) is transformed into a Beast by a beautiful young enchantress who had disguised herself as an old hag. This curse has not only transformed him into a monster closely resembling a humanoid lion, but it has affected his entire castle - turning it into a darkly ominous and Gothic house of horrors (that is obviously meant to match his inner turmoil, hatred, and contempt for the world) and turned his servants and everyone else in it into everyday household items like silverware, furniture, and other decorations.In the nearby town, Belle (Paige O'Hara), the town beauty who is regarded as somewhat of an oddball and a goof - due to her love of books and gaining knowledge (my kind of woman, personally!) - is growing tired of her assigned lot in life and wonders if there's anything better out there. Still, she is generally pleased with what she already has, living with her eccentric inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart). When Maurice leaves town to attend a nearby science exhibition, he gets lost and winds up at the Beast's castle. The angry Beast takes him prisoner, but agrees to let him go in exchange for letting Belle remain in his castle forever.Although Belle is initially repulsed by the Beast, not so much by his looks but by his violent temper, she gradually begins to warm up to him and his kindly staff who begin tending to her every need. Underneath his horrid exterior, she begins to see that he is indeed a kind and gentle soul, and a very lonely one at that, and predictably begins to fall in love with him and vice-versa. Meanwhile back in town, forces led by the town's ultra-vain hot-shot alpha-male, Gaston (Richard White), are conspiring to get Belle to marry him at any cost, while also masterminding the Beast's downfall.""Beauty and the Beast"" is an extraordinary motion picture event, which had the distinction of being the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (that was until Pixar's ""Up"" in 2010). It was also one of the earliest pictures to make use of hand-drawn imagery that was seamless integrated with computer-generated special effects. To me, while I usually detest musicals and even though ""Beauty and the Beast"" has some musical numbers in it, by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, the songs don't slow the film down at all. In fact, they actually enhance the film by actually continuing to tell the story (and they are in fact pretty catchy, which is a rarity in films like this - I might actually go out and by the soundtrack pretty soon).Another aspect of the film that makes it so extraordinary is how dark it is, and also worth mentioning is the fleeting violence of the film's climax (which does include a slapstick showdown at the Beast's castle between the household staff and Gaston's goons, but I'm specifically referring to the climatic fight between the Beast and Gaston on the roof of his castle). And the Beast himself is actually quite scary, especially in the film's earliest moments. I'm quite surprised that ""Beauty and the Beast"" didn't receive at least a ""PG"" rating considering how dark this picture is, both in its subject matter and presentation. Notice how ugly and how drenched in darkness the Beast's castle is when the story begins. But the story is also about beauty, specifically the love of inner beauty. The film and Beast's castle begin to brighten up and come back to life once Belle arrives and begins falling for the Beast.It may be rated ""G,"" but it's still a mature-minded animated feature that doesn't play dumb to its audience and spoon-feed them crappy, sugar-coated moralistic messages about the true ugliness that is sometimes referred to as life.""Beauty and the Beast"" is very easily one of my favorite Disney animated films, very easily one of my favorite animated films of all time, for sure. I especially appreciated its message about inner beauty, a theme that has always been particularly of interest to me in the few love stories I actually like but has never been realized so brilliantly as it has been here.A true Disney classic.10/10"
"Beauty and the Beast is probably the closest to perfection of any film I've ever seen. It's such a beautiful love story, full of suspense, humour and emotion. The animation, as usual with Disney, is stunning. Every frame of the movie has very detailed, beautiful artwork. Special mention goes to the animation of Ms. Pots, Lumiere, Cogswarth, Chip and all the other objects who manage to move naturally without any limbs. And of course there's the Beast, who starts out very menacing and scary and gradually becomes more and more human by his posture and facial expression. The voice actors also have exceptional talent. The actress who plays Belle has a very nice voice and is a great singer. Gaston has very deep, manly voice that suits his character perfectly. But if there was an Oscar for best voice-over performance, it would go to the Beast. He gibes such a powerful, tortured performance, that I really wish I looked up his name before writing this. And also usual with any Disney movie, the songs are ridiculously catchy. I especially love that fun, energetic song about Gaston, and the very beautiful title song ""Beauty and the Beast."" The latter song is sung during a very beautiful sequence where Belle and the Beast are dancing in a CGI room. The CGI maybe dated, but it's still a timeless scene. Another thing Disney also does greatly is mixing romance, comedy and suspense. The movie has lots of funny scenes, especially the parts with Cogsworth and Lumiere, but there are also very intense scenes that will keep you in suspense, like the exciting climax. And of course there are a couple scenes that will have you reaching for the tissues.With interesting characters, catchy songs, nail biting suspense, a beautiful love story and stunning animation, I recommend this masterpiece to just about everybody who watches movies."
"As Mrs Potts rightly sings- ""Tale as old as time"", the story of 'Beauty and the Beast' lives on forever and ever. Never, ever in my life, in my opinion, have I ever seen a film with such complex themes, with such a message to keep the audience thinking and such depth to its story. Of course and rightly Disney has presented this film beautifully and poetically, so all the audience, who have seen the film from old to young, will understand the message and directed by Gary Trousdale, he shows this amazingly.When a selfish prince is turned into a he is hideous beast by a beautiful enchantress, disguised as a beggar women, he is forced to be confined to his castle, along with his faithful servants, who have been turned into common house-hold objects. The only thing with him is a single rose, which will bloom until his twenty first birthday. Until then, if he doesn't find true love, then he is doomed to remain a beast forever. However, there is little hope, when a lovely young woman comes, looking for her father, who is kept hostage in the castle she seems to be the solution and the one to break the dreaded curse. ""For who could ever love a beast?"" Disney really delivers the message of never judging anyone, simply in this fairy tale, in which everyone can keep in their hearts. With characters with such depth, 'Beauty and the Beast' never fails to entice the audience, with the theme of love, finding what really matters and looking deep to what really matters.With the best actors, providing the voice for the characters including Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston, Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice). With Mrs Potts singing the legendary title song, we see the Beast becoming the man that he has hidden all those years.Overall, I cannot stress how much this film touches everyone's hearts. A must see to see... again and again and again!"
"This film is truly a wonder to behold. An excellent film in every aspect. For me, this is the only Disney movie in which the music is comparable to that in ""The Little Mermaid"". Visually, ""Beauty"" is a great example of how CGI can complement hand-drawn artwork without taking over it, like in later Disney films (most notably ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"" and ""Tarzan""). The ballroom sequence was truly groundbreaking but that's about the only ""computerized"" part in the film, thankfully. Belle herself is a fantastic heroine, one who dreams of adventure and not about a lover. I don't see why so many people were let down by the prince in his human form. I thought he was done very well. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is definitely up there with ""The Little Mermaid""."
"This is atypical Academy award contender for Best movie (in 1991) - it is a good movie! Gorgeous Gothic romanticism of dark forest, Gothic castle and enchanted rose are lovely to look at. Belle is a heroine with inner and outer beauty, Beast makes interesting tragic monster who needs to learn to love and be unselfish and Gaston... well, he is sleazy, shallow bully, very villainous. Scene where the scum goes to attack the castle, singing the best song of the whole movie, shows that at least Gaston has voice! Much, much better than Pixar films - yes, Toy Story included! - and in par with such classics than Snow white... perhaps even better!"
"""Once upon a time, a prince lived in a shining castle; and although he had everything his heart desired, he was spoiled and selfish...."" Thus begins one of Disney's most wonderful animated classics. The prince is transformed into a hideous beast, matching his outward appearance with his heart. He is given an enchanted rose which will bloom until his 21st birthday. By the time the last petal falls, he must learn to love someone and earn her love in return, and the spell will be broken. If not, he must remain a beast.The story, music, and characters are all truly enchanting and wonderful, fully embracing the Disney Magic. The setting is France, and I can see the French influence in it when I compare it to other French stories like ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""Phantom of the Opera,"" and ""Les Miserables."" (The last two are not Disney, by the way.) What I really like most about all of these is that they all encourage us not to judge by outward appearance."
"This is, without a doubt, the best film Disney ever made. Now that's saying a lot, as the studio also made ""Bambi"", ""Little Mermaid"" and many other great films. ""Beauty and the Beast"" represents everything they could do right in a movie. The music is fantastic and couldn't be better (mostly because many of the songs had a great sense of humor), the characters wonderful and the story promoted some of the most wonderful values you could want. Belle is a completely admirable young lady--and I was thrilled that my own daughters could watch her and learn about her strength and integrity. And, the film is fun--yet will also bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded viewer. Not surprisingly the film was nominated for Best Picture--it's just a shame that an animated film will probably never take home this Oscar. Well worth seeing and owning--a truly great film."
"This was a well-done Walt Disney animated movie. Although not a huge fan of the movie, I find no fault at all with this film, and it's especially appealing now that it's out on DVD. It looks and sounds super. The colors are bold, bright and just plain gorgeous. The sound separation is excellent. If you have a nice surround system, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this.The story is nothing extraordinary but decent with a lot of subtle humor mixed in with it, mainly with the talking objects in the castle. Little ""teacup"" is the cutest of the characters.The songs, with the exception of the title tune and a Busby Berkeley-type number, are nothing to write home about.Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies."
This movie has been one of my favorite movies for years now.The animation style in the movie is really amazing.The songs are very beautiful.And I love the romantic storyline of Belle and the Beast and it is a very great classic animated movie.Belle's dress in the movie is a very beautiful gold dress and I love how adorable little Chip is in the movie and is very sweet.
"This is an excellent movie for the whole family. I was already in Junior High when this came out but it quickly became one of my favorites. Even now with children of my own I love to pull this movie out and sit down with them to watch it.It starts out with beautiful scenery and wonderful singing. You will follow the life of an ordinary girl named Belle who has a love for reading. She lives alone with her father who is a but odd with his inventions and solitary lifestyle. He goes off to show his invention, he gets lost, finds a castle in the woods and lets himself in. Once inside he meets the enchanted occupants. Then the story really starts. The Beast discovers he has an unannounced visitor and thinks he is there torment him. So the father gets thrown in the tower.Belle has an unwelcoming admirer, the town bully. He tries to woo her, unsuccessfully. She runs out to the field to escape him and finds her fathers riderless horse barreling down on her. She then travels to the woods in search of her father.When she finds him at the castle she trades her life for his and the Beast releases her father and keeps her. Then the story begins."
"""The Beauty and the Beast"" fable has been around for a long time, present in various forms in various different cultures under various different names. For example, in the 1600s there existed a similar Germanic folk-tale, often titled ""The Beast"" or ""The Wolf Prince"".Regardless, the fable is similar in each version, and seems to have started out as a tale told to young women in order to prepare them for intercourse and future marriage. At its core, the story says that man is an animal, is bestial, until a young woman's love redeems him. Or rather: man is not a sexual animal at all, once the woman gets to know him properly.So like most folk tales, this is a giant fantasy designed to placate (and probably even has evolutionary value). In the story the Beast loves the woman, lusts for her daily, though she does not love him. To keep the Beast's hormones at bay, the young woman promises to meet him at his castle, but because she is bound to her father and loves the old man dearly, forgets all about the Beast, who slowly dies of grief. The young woman, seeing the Beast dying, then suddenly realises that the Beast loves her and swiftly falls in love.In a very archetypal sense, the fable symbolizes the union between a sexually developed man and a young, innocent female who views the man as beastly at first, but eventually grows to love him. This happens after she cuts all ties with her father, who up until that point had been the only male figure in her life. When she accepts the Beast, he literally becomes beautiful, his clothes and bestial figure vanishing such that he turns into a prince.Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the beast"" (1946), a film which retells this tale, keeps the same structure but treats it in a much more baroque fashion. It's still a tale filled with much primal, repressed sexuality, but Cocteau is such a master stylist that he imbues virtually every scene with wonderful visual flourishes. With its dancing candle holders, animated household objects and statues, the film is a triumph of art design.Unsurprisingly, the Disney version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" waters things down further. In the Disney version, the young woman is an introvert and outcast (but gorgeous of course) who views the world differently to all the other young women around her.Being different allows the young woman to see and empathise with the ""goodness"" at the heart of the Beast, and so the two outcasts join together, teaching us that it's ultimately ""what's inside that counts"". (if this is so, why does the Beast transform into a prince and why is the ""beauty"" always outwardly beautiful as well? Where are all the fairy tales about an ugly woman struggling to inseminate a Doberman?)This kind of ""march at the beat of your own drum"" and ""be different because you are better than everyone else"" morality tale is common in Disney flicks, but there is also a slightly dark underside to this updated version of the tale.Both the Disney and Cocteau version of the myth feature a ""Gaston"" character who is not found in the original, ancient folk tales. This character represents the ""common mentality"" or ""the standard values"". He's the ""practical male figure"" who the young woman should marry, and whom she is encouraged to marry by her friends and family, but whom she possesses no love for. This little addition updates the tale for a more enlightened society, by portraying ""woman"" as having a certain freedom: the ability to choose the ""bad boy"", the ""beast"", and indulging in her own carnal fantasies, regardless of what her parents say. Of course to make this fantasy palatable, the story has to romanticise the beast and ruthlessly villainize the ""practical man"".In any case, all these re-tellings of ""Beauty and the Beast"" highlight how petty humans are. Incidentally, early art work from the 17th century featured the beast as a literal wolf or dog creature, often with an erect penis, the young woman on her ankles submissively before him. One recalls a line ironically spoken by Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"": ""Perfect for a child."" 8/10 – Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" 7.5/10 – Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" I suspect modern audiences are so familiar with this fairy tale that both Cocteau and Disney's ""retelling"" seem like old news. Still, Cocteau's film features wonderful art design (Cocteau mingled with many French surrealists), inventive camera work and is pleasantly fast paced. It's probably the best version of this story, though I wonder what use modern man has for these centuries old fables.Worth one viewing."
"From the time we could walk we would all hear about films such as The Little Mermaid or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and how they changed film-making forever. These films helped bring animation to life (Snow White being the first animated film and The Little Mermaid reviving the genre after it had almost died) while there are films which keep it alive. Beauty and the Beast is one of (if not) the best work of animation there has ever been.The story is about a girl named Belle who wants to have a better life than the ordinary one she got stuck with. In the beginning we learn of the prince who got turned into a beast for his heart was cold. And if he couldn't find anyone to love and love him in return before the rose he was given had wilted then him and all of the people who live in the castle (turned into house ware items) would remain the way they were forever. And that is where Belle comes in, as she goes in search for her father who went missing she finds herself at the Beast's castle and her father as well. In exchange for his freedom she would remain there and never leave again or see her loved ones again. So now a chain of events has been set into motion that will determine the fate of the Beast and all who inhabit his castle.Beauty and the Beast is obviously one of the most romantic, funny, charming, and enchanting films ever made. The characters are funny, loving, and beautifully made. The music is perfect along with the animation. Because of the animation we can see many charming characters do things that hasn't been done before in animation. The choreography moves everywhere and leaves us all just wanting more. This film is an instant classic filled with beautiful animation, great choreography, timeless music, and a love story to make your heart melt. Beauty and the Beast is one of the most enchanting films ever made, people will want to watch this over and over again."
The only animated movie to receive the best picture Oscar nomination and indeed it deserved it. The songs are very good and perfect for the scenes. My sister and i watched this movie many times when we were kids. I had tears in my eyes when the beast dies . Till i was a teenager i watched cartoons and i did watched this movie multiple times. I have seen some other good animated movies but i don't think they or any other animated movie which can be compared to this one. Beauty and the Beast is my only one favorite animated movie.
"This movie is beautiful. No other word can describe this film. It's the Shawshank Redemption animated. This movie is the greatest Disney movie ever, in my opinion. Lion King is very good but it's not even close to this. It will give you bumpers, it will make you laugh, smile and cry. It will change your life in some small way, but still it will do something to you. The music is amazing, the voice acting is fail free, everything about this movie is perfect! I will not give any spoilers about this film but it is a MUST SEE for everybody! Watch this movie and you'll know that it deserves better ratings! Beautiful, just beautiful!"
"I saw this movie as a child, and liked it OK.As the years passed, the VHS sat in the corner of my room and collected dust. We moved, and my family lost the copy of it. Strangely, one day, while opening an unopened box, I stumbled across some old Disney movies, and a beat up VHS player. So I hooked it up, and put in Beauty and the Beast on a whim. The only word I could use to describe the experience is: stunning. From the low drone of the tuba at the start of the movie accompanying the enchanting story of a selfish heart, to the triumphant end with some of the most beautiful animation I have ever seen... I was astounded. The artists from the movie were brilliant. The beast was Perfectly scary enough to still be human, and Belle was normal enough to be beautiful. The colors used throughout the movie are perfect. The use of warm, dark colors moved with the story, creating a very atmospheric setting, relaxing enough to lull one into a dream.Aside from the art, the music is impeccable. Every catchy tune repeatedly pops into my head just thinking about the movie. The orchestration flows smoothly throughout the movie, blending remarkably with the art, and the story.Finally.... The story. The story is one of the most beautiful love stories of all time. The idea that a beautiful (stubborn) girl could ever fall in love with a hideous, but troubled beast- even with an evil man trying to split true (yet, perhaps, undiscovered) love apart- is so pleasing and encouraging to everyone with a heart. Whole, broken, or mended. So, whether you watch the movie every day, or just remembered that it was in a box in the attic, you can surely appreciate the beautiful art, music, and message which is presented in this masterpiece."
"Beauty and the Beast in my opinion never gets old! It's always young and magical. I love the characters, animation, music, and story. In the story a Prince gets transformed into a Beast for being selfish towards an enchantress disguised as an old woman. He later falls in love with a girl named Belle who he takes prisoner. His whole household who have also turned into objects from the enchantress also like her hoping that she falls in love with the Beast to break the spell and be human again. My favorite scene in the movie is towards the end when Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) and Cogsworth (David Ogden Siters)argue over who told who that Belle was gonna break the spell. That was funney. I also liked when Gaston told Belle that his little wife (Belle) was going to massage his feet while the little ones (Strapping Boys) played on the floor with the dogs. That was hilarious. Gaston in my opinion was one of the greatest animated villains ever because he's got a lot of comic in him. Filled with great animation, story, characters, and music written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who sadly died of Aids before the film's release) Beauty and the Beast is an animated feature that'll go on forever and ever. I'm glad it's the only animated feature to win an award for Best Picture because I think it really deserved that and I think Walt Disney himself would of been very proud to know of that award. 10 out of 10."
"I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters in 1991 (I was 5 years old) and fell in love immediately. I used to watch this movie when it came out on video soon after. Wore out my VHS copy. I was excited when the movie came out in IMAX in 2002 (I was 17) and, though I would have preferred to see it with my friends, I enjoyed it nonetheless. My aunt bought the movie when it was released on Special Platinum Edition DVD, knowing that I'd be upset if she didn't.This movie is arguably one of the greatest films ever made, with its great story, stunning animation & Academy Award winning songs, my favourites being ""Belle,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Human Again"" & the heartwarming title song, of course. The movie reminds me very much of my best friend, as she is a lot like Belle (forgiving, slow to anger, very patient, understanding and loving) and I'm a lot like Beast (ugly and utterly abominable when I lose my temper). In spite of all this, she loves me for who I am, though we can never be together.I cannot recommend this classic movie enough for everyone. Classic songs, a great story and stunning animation make this film a treasure. The Special Platinum Edition DVD has a treasure trove of riches with which you are most certain to be enchanted, including not one, not two, but 3 versions of this most excellent and history making movie (it is the only animated feature ever to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, winning two for Best Original Score & Best Original Song, also picking up two nominations for Best Original Song and Best Sound and won 3 Golden Globes, including Best Picture). Rated G."
"Belle is a beautiful, innocent, intelligent and kind young girl bored with her life in her small village. Her lovable father falls in the clutches of the Beast who is really a handsome prince under a spell. She trades herself for her father's freedom. The Beast agrees. Also the spell on him can be broken if someone loves him--but time is running out. Since this is a Disney film you probably know how it ends.This was a blockbuster success for Disney. It was also the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It's beautifully done with some jaw-dropping animation--the ballroom sequence is already a classic. Also it's a musical and it's one of those rare occurrences where EVERY song works! This was a well-deserved Oscar winner for Best Song and Score. I saw the extended version with one new song--""Human Again""--which fits in seamlessly with the original movie. All the voices match the characters perfectly--it's quite amusing to realize that Robby Benson does the Beast's voice! Also this was (for Disney) a step forward in portraying female characters. Their previous film (""The Little Mermaid"") got some heat for how the mermaid NEEDED a man to live. In this film Belle doesn't need anyone--she's strong, self-willed and can fight back. She does fall in love with the Beast but not because she needs him--in fact he needs her! For Disney that was feminism.Basically one of the best Disney cartoons ever. Also it's perfect for the kids--only really small ones might be frightened. Perfect for everyone--a 10 all the way."
