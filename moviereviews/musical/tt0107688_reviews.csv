"Nightmare Before Christmas is such a classic movie that will always hold a special place in my heart, even if the new emo generation is claiming hold of it, they do realize that this film was made years before, right? Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town"". Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she alone fears that his plans will become disastrous. Christmas Eve he begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts: shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, only terrify the recipients. Realizing what damage he did Jack attempts to fix what he has done, but has to make sure to make Santa safe and happy again.People who do not enjoy this movie, I don't understand how you could not honestly. It's such a charming movie and very unforgettable, I was 10 years old when I first saw this in the theater in 1995, I still watch it every year for Halloween and even Christmas. My sister and I are grown women, but if I slip in the soundtrack, we become kids again and start singing to The Boogey Song. I do admit that Spencer's Gifts and Hot Topic have over blown on the Nightmare Before Christmas memorabilia, but everyone wants something from this movie because it's just that memorable and you can't help but fall in love with it. It's positively magical, Jack Skeleton is awesome and can steal any holiday any time, I loved his ideas personally, Easter is next! 10/10"
"Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King Â– the creative genius behind the holiday of Halloween, designing each year to be scarier and more horrible than the one before. However deep inside he longs for more than the horror and scares of Halloween Town, a longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes of which has evaded him all these years. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas all the time. But the others in the towns realize the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack's evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.With Pixar currently dominating the world of 'animations that please both children and adults' it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film to the cinema using a much more traditional animation and a huge amount of imagination. The basic plot is a great little fantasy fairytale with a very dark heart to it that make it much more enjoyable for having that edge. Too often kids films (especially at the time and animated) are soaked in a sweet sentiment that simply forgets that kids are not stupid and indeed often prefer a bit of darkness in the story. The only downside of this darkness is that younger children might not 'get it' and just end up being scared by the Halloween images and imaginative images. Despite this the material will play equally well to adults and children because it neither panders to nor excludes one group over the other at any time. Regardless of the material, the film still manages to come off as charming and enjoyable thanks to a well-written script that never plays for the basic laugh or easy sentiment. Some viewers may come to this with Pixar in their minds and bemoan it for not being hilariously funny from start to finish, but they are missing the point andThe songs reflect this approach and are very clever throughout; whether it is the sorrowful longing of Jack at the start or the Cab Calloway-inspired song from Oogie Boogie Man, generally they are inventive and fun. The same praise can be laid at the door of the stop-motion animation, which is inventive and fun to look at from start to finish. All the characters have a great deal of effort put in and they add to the dark feel of the film. The voice cast may not feature a load of well-known voices in the same way as Pixar films generally do, but they still do a great job. Sarandon and Elfman combine to do a good job with Jack; Page is fun as Oogie Boogie; O'Hara is good as Sally despite not having as fun a character to work with but for my money it is Hickey (as Dr Finklestein) and Shadix (Mayor) that make the biggest impression, mainly due to having the most enjoyable characters.Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (with the same material) and never ignores or panders to one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairytale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered even as kids movie get smarter and fancier."
"By 1993, director Tim Burton was such a successful filmmaker in Hollywood that he was able to return to one of his most beloved early projects, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" It's certainly an inspired movie, as it is also very weird, and when I say ""weird,"" I mean it's distinctly Burton.Even though it was directed with enough competency by Henry Selick, this groundbreaking stop-motion animation film is Burton all the way, as it contains ample ""esque"" qualities that make this ""Nightmare"" uniquely his vision.As the film opens in the twisted, ""Burton""-esque village of ""Halloweentown,"" Jack Skellington, who is dually voiced by Chris Sarandon and longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, is celebrating another ""horrible"" Halloween. You'll be shocked and amazed at some of the town's inhabitants, who include jazz-playing zombies, Four Tenor-like vampires, a wolf man, and a wheelchair-bound scientist who occasionally opens up his cranium to (literally) scratch his brain; his creation, a Frankenstein-like scarecrow named Sally (Catherine O'Hara), yearns for contact with others and is quite fond of Jack Skellington.But Jack's quickly growing tired of the same old routine year after year, and because he's so downtrodden with boredom, he ventures into the dark forest outside the town's borders, and accidentally stumbles onto the wondrous, jolly world of ""Christmastown."" Enticed by its splendor, he decides to bring back his discovery to the residents of Halloweentown, who of which are just as shocked by Christmas as he is. Jack gets the brilliant idea to pose as Santa Claus but hires three mischief-makers to kidnap the real Santa so he can share his own, misguided vision of Christmas with an unprepared world.Painstakingly and meticulously crafted, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a beautiful and wonderful film from start to finish. The most famous image of this film is the cover art, which features Skellington eerily silhouetted against a full moon while he stands atop a coiled hill that overlooks a desolate graveyard.Burton is such a wonderful director, who had already brought us one unique ""esque"" vision after the other, especially with the first two ""Batman"" films and ""Edward Scissorhands"" behind him as of '93 when ""Nightmare"" was made.10/10"
"I was a kid when I first saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas, but I wasn't scared by it in the slightest - this world is one entirely of the imagination, and in a sense saying that the film is scary for younger children is something of a compliment.  'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.  A+"
"I am not a big Tim Burton fan, but this movie is in my top 3 of all time. Perhaps the fact that Halloween is my favorite holiday influenced my opinion, but I doubt it. The more I hear and read about this movie, the more I love it.Based on a parody of the famous ""Night before Christmas"" poem by Moore that Burton wrote and illustrated while employed at Disney, this idea was stagnant for many years prior to filming. In many ways this was a good thing, technology was able to catch up to Burton's ideas.In NBC, we see our hero Jack Skellington, aka The Pumpkin King, depressed as another Halloween passes. In the background we hear the residents of Halloween Town celebrate another wonderful holiday. But Jack is sad. The only one who notices is the Rag Doll-style woman Sally.Other characters, including many town-monsters, are introduced. We meet the wonderful mayor with two faces, the evil scientist and his assistant, three local children and our evil boogie-man.After an accident, Jack develops a plan to kidnap ""Sandy Claws"" and give presents out for Christmas in place of Christmas Town. You will have to view this movie to discover the rest.The claymation is not what I expected, it was of a high quality and the movements are not jerky like the old Christmas Specials. Danny Elfman's music has little resemblance to his work with Ongo Bongo and ""What's this?"" (which Jack sings when he discovers the colorful world of Christmas Town) is closer to a tune mixed from Cabaret and The Music Man. The voices match the mouth movements nearly perfectly. This was a project from the heart and all the little touches to make it 'just' right show this fact."
"This film, while far from Burton's masterpiece, is a delightful musical that in the end shows that, sometimes, we have things far better than we think we do and the other side of the fence sometimes looks better just because it's different, but that doesn't make necessarily wise to pursue someone else's dream because we mistakenly think we may like it more.  Tim Burton's fingerprints are all over this film.  Excellent casting of vocal talent, the score is great and the animation is marvelous.  A very good film and worth watching more than once.  Recommended."
"THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS / (1993) ***1/2Starring the voices of: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, Ken Page, Ed Ivory, and William Hickey Directed by Henry Celiac. Written by Michael McDowell. Running time: 76 minutes. Rated PG (for horrific images and some animated violence).	Tim Burton seems like the only being on the planet who could come with characters such as the ones found in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" The feature is literally a tale likely to be found in a child's dreams. It creates a world of its own, inhabiting unforgettable characters and events that should be shared with generations. This film is a visual masterpiece; a movie that deserves to be a holiday favorite for some time to come.
	The atmosphere director Henry Celiac captures in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is truly breathtaking. The cities and setting in which these characters live are visually perplexing, yet descriptive and develop the production's mood perfectly. We, as audiences starving for originality and imagination, are able to enter a scope so believable and unrelentingly convincing we lust for every last minute of it.The movie's protagonist is Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of the holiday town of Halloween. Jack is the role model for much of the cities population. The only problem is that Jack has been around for ages, parked in a town where every single year builds up for a conventional holiday, Halloween. This character has grown depressed and saddened by the routine living style he inhabits. We learn of his passion for new events and a and new life through a musical number that is both effective and engaging.Later on that vary night, Jack wonders off into a nearby woods and stumbles upon an area surrounded with magical doors leading to specific holiday worlds. Jack, blooming with curiosity, enters Christmas town: a joyful, happy place with snow, glitter, children singing, and colorful lights decorating the village in its entirety. Jack is mystified by the glamorous atmosphere, and rushes home to tell the Town of Halloween about his adventures.	We realize the internalconflict is Jack's boredom of routine. This becomes more complex when he tries to figure out the meaning of Christmas. The external problem comes later in the plot, where we predict an uneasy disaster upcoming due to his intentions of recreating Christmas in Halloween style.Other key characters are Sally, the puppet-like creation of an angry professor, the city's Mayor who has a head for both his good and bad personality, the Oggie Boogie, the film's villain who is everything we ever dreamed of regarding a diabolical animated bad guy, and the inevitable character of Santa Clause.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not necessarily a children's movie, it might be too strange or fanatical for the very young. It is certainly a musical production, and at times, I felt that the songs replaced essential development. However, the musical numbers are challenging and memorable, containing passion and emotion. The picture is a walk into the mind of some of the most wildly imaginative filmmakers of our time. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is titled wonderfully, although the film is truly not a nightmare, but a dream--a dream brought to life on the big screen.

"This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I never like holiday movies, because i always find them to be full to bursting with slapstick comedy, or way too sugary-sweet and dramatic. both of these things are okay in moderation, but most Christmas movies seem to go to one side of the spectrum or the other. this wonderful fairy tale is perfect for someone like me, who likes a little bit of a darker movie, but expects a Christmas movie to have a good message. the darkness in the movie is not without cause-it shows the joy of Christmas in great contrast to the scariness of Halloween, and it made me love both holidays all the more for that reason. i don't know, maybe that's just because Halloween and Christmas are my favorite holidays, but i really feel that this movie is great for older children and adults. younger children (up to 5 or 6 years) may find this simply frightening, but older children would find it wonderful."
"Thank God for stop-motion animation and the creative genius that is Tim Burton because any other technique would have diminished its surrealistic landscape. But, however kid-friendly THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas appears, this is a somewhat disturbing tale that children under the age of ten may not like because of some of its subject matter, specifically a scene in which Santa Claus gets tortured by the Boogeyman and children have a frightening experience with Christmas presents that turn deadly.Relying heavily on HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas, the story tells of how Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown is in a rut because every Halloween is the same old thing. By accident he stumbles onto what seems to be a portal embedded unto a tree which lands him in magical Christmastown -- a place which enchants him, a place where ""Sandy Claws"" is revered as its gift-giver. Here he gets an epiphany of an idea: he decides that he wants to celebrate Christmas the Halloween way, all in good spirit, and decides to kidnap Santa Claus, but Sally, the rag doll who loves him, has a strong feeling that this will not turn out well and must find a way to stop him, particularly when Oogie Boogie, the Boogeyman, enters the scene with nasty intentions.This is, quite simply, a beautiful film despite its dark and borderline disturbing tone which arrive late into the story once Jack Skellington decides to go on his frightful crusade to bring Halloween into Christmas unto an unsuspecting world. However, the film is really in good cheer and even a ghoul as mean as Oogie Boogie proves to be quite harmless. I do believe, though, this is a film to be watched closely and with a child spirit in order to appreciate its technical wizardry: Jack Skellington's eyes say it all: when has a skeleton looked so childlike and full of wonder? And who but a child could create the havoc stemming from a prank instead from meanness? Like I said -- this is a stunning film, and one the family can view on not one but two holiday seasons. If you like your Christmas a little iconoclastic and retch at the thought of singing another Christmas carol, this is the film for you."
"I was five years old when I saw this movie and after that the words Tim Burton rang in my ears as one of Hollywood's most eccentric directors. Whenever I hear that a Tim Burton film is coming out I think of The Nightmare Before Christmas and how wonderful it is. The story is very original, the scenery is wonderfully Gothic and the characters and animation is to scream for. Another thing about this film are the songs. They're so twisted and funny that I can't help but hum, whistle or just sing them word by word and musical note by musical note. So in conclusion, The Nightmare Before Christmas is what you would get if you were to put the minds of Edgar Allen Poe and Dr. Seuss in a blender. You get a beautifully dark and wildly bizarre film about Santa Claus, dancing skeletons and what goes bump in the night."
"The Nightmare Before Christmas has captivated me with its crazy and sinister animation, its haunting soundtrack and its horrific yet enchanting characters. When it was first released in the U.K., the trailers terrified me and I refused to go and see it. However, I have now aquired deeply sadistic humour and so relish in such brilliant and infectious songs like ""Kidnap the Sandy Claws"". My friends and family now get exceedingly annoyed by my attempts to recite the musical score on car journeys etc. The sets and props are amazing and painstakingly detailed-just take a look at Santa's list and the Halloween/Christmas plans. I only have one complaint; there should have been more appearances from Lock, Shock and Barrel: a thoroughly malevolent trio."
"Tim Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of the nice animated movies not from Disney. It is about Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, who lives in Halloweentown. One day he goes through a door in a tree and arrives in Christmastown and sees how happy and beautiful it is over there. When he is back in Halloweentown he shows his friends what Christmas is like, and he suggests to do Christmas this year instead of Halloween. Things do not go as planned.Everything is beautifully animated and although the story is not that great it is entertaining the whole way through. I liked all the songs in the movie and there are some good laughs as well. Definitely worth watching."
"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a perfectly professionally made movie with almost flawless looking stop-motion animation. However as entertainment this movie is flawed, due to its simple story and a pace that is a bit too fast for the movie.""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has some highly fun and amusing characters in it and that also is the strongest thing of the movie. Jack Skellington is a nice and memorable main character but it is the Mayor that mostly steals the show in this movie. The movie is filled with tons of odd looking- and acting monstrous characters. Oogie Boogie is a cool villain but he unfortunately doesn't get an awful lot to do in this movie. The characters are fun but the movie itself isn't halve as much as fun. There are just a few laughs in it and in general the movie is simply too short. Because the movie is so short all of the scene's come and go too fast after each other. The story is told too fast and because of that things aren't always build up nicely or correctly. Because of this there also are some plot holes in the movie. The movie should had been maybe at least 10-15 minutes longer. It makes ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" a bit of a movie that is most certainly not bad but has many missed opportunities in it.Even though the movie isn't directed by Tim Burton himself, it still has 'Tim Burton' written all over it. The visual style and characters are definitely Burton material. There is plenty to enjoy for his fans, in this movie. The music and songs by Danny Elfman are also what gives this movie a 'Burton' kind of feeling and atmosphere. The music by Elfman is good and the songs, even though no Oscar material, are enjoyable and quite memorable as well.It certainly is a professionally made and good looking movie but the story could had used some more work and the movie should had been longer, to build up the scene's and characters better. It still is an enjoyable movie to watch but it could and should had been way more entertaining.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is a visually spectacular tour de force of Gothic styles and themes, bound around a simple children's tale. The story follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween Town, who one day while walking in the woods stumbles upon Christmas Town; a town where, you guessed it, every day is Christmas. Jack doesn't quite understand the concept of a celebration where nobody is frightened or killed, but he decides to have the celebration in his town regardless. While plotting, he also decides to kidnap Santa and deliver Christmas Town's gifts himself this year...much to the dismay of the local children, who aren't too pleased about receiving the gifts that a skeleton from Halloween Town brings them...This movie was actually directed by Henry Sellick, but it is obviously Tim Burton's film. His style is rampant throughout the film, and it is clear that this could only have come from his mind. The animation on display here is magnificent; the style is very unique and it blends very well with the Gothic theme. Where the film falls down, however, is on the story side and, more notably, the delivery of the story. The story is very linear; I understand that this film is predominantly aimed at children, but even children's films can be more expansive than this; the film also really should be more expansive as Tim Burton has created a whole world with many unique and interesting characters, yet only a handful are allowed to shine. Burton (and his composer, Elfman) seem far too keen to pack the movie with songs. I have no problem with this, but the songs here are really rather dull. The majority of them have little more than one or two lines that are sung over and over and considering that the film is packed with these songs; it gets old fast and more dialogue would have worked better.Overall, Nightmare Before Christmas is a nice film. The animation and style are amazing and it has lots of nice moments; but it is let down by a thin story and poor delivery. Horror fans will have fun spotting the tributes, and I don't doubt that many children will love this film, as will many adults; but it could and really should have been a lot better, and I have to say that it left me cold."
"How appropriate that I start holiday viewing with a film that bridges Halloween and Christmas.Now, I am not a fan of animated films, but this isn't the usually animation you find in Disney films.It is call stop-motion animation, and it looks very realistic.Now, Jack Skellington from Halloweentown (voiced by Chris Sarandon and Danny Elfman (the singing), is really getting bored with Halloween - the same thing every year, and he goes walking in the forest and enters the door for Christmastown.He gets excited about Christmas, and tries to institute it in Halloweentown. Unfortunately, he doesn't understand the concept and it turns out badly. They even kidnap Santa Claus (voiced by Edward Ivory).And, can you believe they even wove a love story in here.The film is full of interesting characters, of course, and some really good music. It is a visual feast."
"Who would ever think that a musical about the overlap between Halloween and Christmas would work? However, it does work with the songs not exactly being Christmas - or Halloween - classics, but fitting the dark mood of this film perfectly.The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace ""Sandy Claws"" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -""I'm only an elected official here! I can't make decisions!"" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is ""You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having."" You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as ""Beetlejuice"". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family."
"I remember when I was in 3rd grade I became obsessed with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". I remember telling my friends at school my own ""stories"" of some of the characters. To this day, I still love it.Everything about this movie is excellent, great, beautiful, every positive word you can think of. The songs, the animation, the characters, everything! Let's start with some of them.The songs are excellent and they should've been nominated for an Oscar for Best Songs, and it should've won! My favorite song is Sally's Song, which is just too gorgeous for words. I also love This is Halloween, Kidnap the Sandy Claws (that song is hilarious), and Oogie Boogie Man, which reminds me of a Ray Charles song.The characters are great, too. Jack, who is wise and independent; Sally, who is gorgeous, sweet, and kind; the Mayor, who's chatty and talkative; Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who are mischievous but friendly; Dr. Finkelstein, who's usually grumpy all the time; and of course, the Oogie Boogie Man, who's evil.The animation is gorgeous, not like anything else I've seen. The movie was made in the early '90s and it has the most spectacular animation of any animated movie made in the '90s! This has been one of my favorite animated movies for a long time and it still is. In fact, when I get older and have a career in show business, I'll release an album where I sing songs from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". You'll soon see! This is a great movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. Great job, Tim Burton!"
"I love Tim Burton movies in general, but I think that this one is something special. Not only do I like the characters and the story, but since there are already a bazillion comments about those things, I'd like to point out the prodigious gifts of Danny Elfman, who wrote the songs and the score for this film. He's amazing.Of course, anyone who loves ""The Simpsons"" as much as I do is already an Elfman fan... and as Jack Skellington you can hear just a hint of the singing voice of Sideshow Bob!But it's the music that just blows me away. It ranges in style from the 1920's Kurt Weill- Bertolt Brecht adaptations (right down, on occasion, to the rhythm banjo and mournful alto sax), to the Russian composers, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich, all done with a sense of humor and homage that keeps it fresh, unlike, say, Kander and Ebb, who keep writing Weill-Brecht material to the point that there's more of their music in that particular style than there is by Weill, who figured out by the 1930's that it would only go so far, and who wrote some of the great tunes of the American theatre, as well as the incredible and underrated opera ""Street Scene.""Elfman is a film composer whose work ranks with the best of (and this is high praise, indeed, coming from me) John Williams, Bernard Herrmann, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Even if this weren't a wonderful movie to watch (and it is) it would be a wonderful movie to hear."
"Jack Skellington is the pumpkin king of Halloween Town. He is very famous in his city and also the object of Sally's affection, a doll that was made by Dr. Finkelstein to serve him. Jack is tired of doing the same presentations every year for the Helloween,and he tries to think about something new, but the inspiration never comes. One day, while walking with his ghost dog, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town by mistake. He stays amazed with what he sees, and decides to copy the idea to do in Helloween town,even kidnapping Santa Claus. He tells the people of his city about his idea, and spite of the fact that they don't get very well the Christmas idea,they help to produce the most strange and bizarre 'toys' for the human kids,like bats,spiders and Gothic dolls. But things are not the way he imagined...."
Halloween and Christmas are two of my favorite holidays! Tim Burton is still the genius when he and the crew worked on this film. My sister likes this film. I love the film's animation and Danny Elfman's composing. I also like the musical numbers. Jack is my favorite character and really wanted to be like him on Halloween. Burton takes us on a dark and scary journey when we watch his films. That's what I like about him. We enter Tim Burton's dark world of imagination.HAPPY HALLOWEEN TO US ALL!!!
"Once upon a time there was a town called Halloweentown ! Where everything is Halloween, all year around ! Then Jack Skelington the Pumpkin king of this dreary and creepy little town. Had a wonderfully awful idea why not, celebrate Christmas and make it ours. There in lies the title , The Nightmare Before Christmas. A dark and gloomy spin on the classic poem. 'Twas the Night Before Christmas', that only Tim Burton himself could deliver! Such a twisted tale,of meshing Christmas and Halloween together as one! In this hauntingly delightful musical. About kidnapping Father Christmas, and putting his own spin on the holiday! But his plan takes a frightful turn for the worse, when the toys he created terrify and turn on the little kids! All of that sinister planning of his crashed and burned! My favorite character was Sally , a kind hearted rag doll held captive by a mad scientist! Who in the end won over the black hearted Jack! I love this this movie ! It combines two of my favorite holidays together. In a off colorsort of way!"
"This movie is so dark, funny and cute its hard to explain, but i'll try, here goes. Jack Skellington is the king of Halloween, the scariest guy in town. But he's bored and restless with life. One night, walking in the woods, he comes across a doorway to Christmastown, where everyone is happy, kind, cheerful and no ones dead! He decides he wants to try Christmas himself, so all of Halloweentown try to claim Christmas while preparing for their very own Christmas eve...This has got to be the best animation films i have ever seen, it is not up-to-date computer technology with fancy lighting effects and computerised water reflection. Its old-fashioned, simple puppet animation, and it fits fantastically. The attention to detail is extraordinary, Halloweentown pacifically looks wonderfully Gothic. Christmas town is..well..christmassy. The puppets movement seems a little jittery the first time you watch it, but once you are used to the style you will not notice anything drastic.You do really feel for Jack as a depressed skeleton, bored with his life. You want him to find what hes looking for. Also for Sally, Jacks unnoticed, under appreciated love interest who knows something will go wrong and tries in vain to stop Christmas. The greatest characters though are the Oogie Boogie man, a gambling addict, slightly old school town misfit brilliantly voiced by Ken Page. And the Mayor, who has two personalities, optimistic or neurotic, depending which side of his head your talking too! The music is catchy, although sometimes it gets in the way of important character development, and everyone in the cast can sing (which is unusual for this type of musical.) Only one song is a little boring and that is the slow one which is sung by Jack second, but you soon forget about that and on to the brilliant ones like 'Kidnap mr. Sandy Claws' and 'The Oogie Boogie song.' My only glich with this film is it doesn't spend enough time on the character development the other residents of Halloweentown, spending far too much time on Jack. I for one would love too discover more about Oogie Boogie, like why was he outcast in the first place? and why does he seem to have a vendetta with Jack? And there are a lot of background characters who i would have loved too see more of. Wolfman, The hanging tree, the 2 witches, the slime monster and the Vampires to name a few.A cute little plot woven in with brilliant characters and catchy songs, Tim Burton has outdone himself with this holiday treat for everyone!"
"Part of my mission on IMDb is to identify films that are not given their due ... this pretty much qualifies. Danny Elfman, in the single most astonishing work of his career, takes on PHANTOM OF THE OPERA .. and beats it. I have seen Phantom both in live theatre and on film. It is brilliant but flawed. There are gaps in the story. Some of the songs don't work. None of that applies here. Plus, Sir you-know-who did not actually sing his own songs in Phantom! Here, Elfman did! Not only is this Elfman's best work but (this is a tougher call, given the quality of the man's output) this could be Burton's as well. Mesmerizing from the first frame to the last. It is a story about hope and ambition, a cautionary tale, a lesson in fixing the messes you make, and even a love story. Catherine O'Hara steals every scene as Sally, a tribute to her voice actressing and to the animation also. Kindly note that TWICE AS MANY IMDb users have penned a review as there were ACTUAL REVIEWERS in the mainstream who tackled this. This should be a high 9+ on the IMDb. For me it is a one-of-a-kind film that defies comparison, and all it knows is how to entertain. Rating 17/10"
"With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'), Thanksgiving (`Home for the Holidays'), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' directed by Henry Selick.	Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no `rush' in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into `Christmas Town,' and discovers something new (`What's this?  What's this!')-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  `And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!'  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!	Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his `nightmare'-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.	Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.	The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, `The Nightmare Before Christmas' is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies. Tim Burton style.  I rate this one 10/10."
"There's life in stop motion yet.  Burton and Selick's film is a fine retort to `Toy Story'; or at least it would have been if `Toy Story' had been made first.  Fluid, three-dimensional animation in a completely designed world - that's what the two films have in common, but `The Nightmare Before Christmas' looks undeniably better.  Partly it's the more imaginative art direction.  Partly, also, it's just the fact that there's something enervating about digital effects, and something special about using real, physical artwork, and photographing it.  I don't know how well the world of Halloween will stand up over the years, but no-one will forget what it looks like.The plot alarmingly resembles that of a Rankin/Bass TV special, but with more teeth.  Jack Skellington, ruler of the land of Halloween, falls in love with the land of Christmas, and decides to conquer it.  The difference between `Nightmare' and its dismal TV cousins is that the land of Halloween really is a grisly place.  (Gorgeous, but grisly.)  Jack Skellington is a gentle ruler with an imperfect hold on power.  (Santa Claus, by contrast, is not quite the innocent he appears to be.)  It all ends a little too soon: I would have liked to see more attention paid to the story after all the fun scene-setting.  Still, it's a delicious movie."
"I hate myself...This movie has been out since TEN years and I never bothered to watch it earlier. ""Totally not my style"" I thought. Well, I've seldom been more wrong...This movie is everybody's style !!! I think I'll start watching it every year now on the 24th of december...( What can I say, I'm a traditional person :-D ) No seriously, I loved this movie. It gave me a warm feeling, plenty of laughs and a good old portion of sentiment. Heck, I even almost caught myself on singing along. I can assure you this means something !Actually, it's one of the few times the singing in a movie isn't annoying. Tim Burton's style is well presented in this story. Only he can tell a fairy-tale in such a macabre and morbid way. The atmosphere comes very close to that other masterpiece of his, Edward Scissorhands. The coorporation with Danny Elfman only makes the whole finished project more terrific.SPOILERS !!!!!!!!! The story is about Jack Skellington. The pumpkin-king of Halloween town. In this cute little world, a large amount of horrible creatures prepare the celebration of Halloween. After the annual holiday, Jack is a bit disappointed and takes a long walk. He ends up in Christmas town. This village is similar to Halloween town only they're responsible for the preparation of Christmas. Jack is so enthusiast about this that he wants to introduce this idea in Halloween town. Jack is set to replace ""Santa Claws"" and he will ride out to give presents to the children on Christmas evening! END SPOILERS !!!!!!! The characters in this wonderful story are very memorable. The wicked Dr. Finklestein on top. He looks like an evil version of Duckman and he opens his metal skull to scratch his brains. Very funny ! The female he created, Sally, is adorable and she's the greatest tribute to ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" I've ever seen. Many other great references to classic horror films and I always appreciate things like that. The Boogieman, the Mayor, the witch...all these characters deserve their share of credit but I think I'll just stop here and finish by saying that this movie is highly recommended. Favorite ""rewind""-scene: Jack tries to explain the concept of Christmas to rest of his town through a song. They don't see the whole point of it and wonder why this whole thing doesn't involve death or horror. Hilarious !!"
"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perennially delightfully film, and one I watch yearly before both pertinent holidays. Jack Skellington, master-in-chief of Halloween Town, has grown bored with his life (or rather death) and ventured into the unknown: a portal that leads to Christmas Town. He attempts to bring the jolly spirit and key pieces into Halloween Town, and assumes the position of Sandy Claws (Santa Clause) in his search for fulfillment and novelty. This film always instills a sense of wonder and excitement, as the audience is carried along on Jacks shelter-skelter ride, and one shares his infectious thirst for adventure. As a musical, the story is supplemented with various songs and musical themes, repeating at key moments to emphasize characters, events, or themes and moods that are important to the audiences perception of the storyline. The dark, yet upbeat songs provide a pleasing ambiance of mundane horror, as life in Halloween Town supposedly is. I find the romance between Sally and Jack to be rushed and a bit trite, but fits with the classic structure and nature of the film."
"Henry Selick did an amazing job adapting Tim Burton's original story of this Halloween/Christmas classic. I just bought the new two-disc set and am very happy to own it. I am a very big Tim Burton fan and this is definitely a Burton film so fans will not be let down. Watch it as soon as you can!The singing is amazing as well as the songs themselves and all of the characters are brilliant. The story is the driving force and easily the best part of the movie but the amazing visuals and stop motion animation would be a very close second. I was blown away by how this film looked as well as everything else.If you grew up on this film like I did, you owe it to yourself to get the new DVD set. It's like experiencing the film for the first time all over again. Give it a chance!"
"'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those films that is a true one of a kind release, and a genuine benchmark for it's genre. The Nightmare Before Christmas has truly pushed the creative limits of the staid yet classic art form of stop motion clay animation, and truly highlighted to us the creative genius that Tim Burton has been internationally renowned as.The Nightmare Before Christmas is a film that uses it's music and general style of film-making to create a character's thoughts and mind. Such as when Jack Skellington sings about a longing feeling that he cannot find, he stands on top of a hill, in the night, and the moon reflects on his figure moving around in the scene. Danny Eflman's moody but arguably deep lyrics and musical score truly emulate Jack's feeling. Both the dark atmosphere of the shot, and decidedly gloomy music makes Jack's mind lost, unclear and cannot see what he truly desires for. The Nightmare Before Christmas therefore becomes a truly iconic and deep experience for any moviegoer to witness.Overall, The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and one of my best as well."
"Jack Skellington, aka the Pumpkin King, is a skeleton who is in charge of planning out Halloween. He lives in a place called Halloween Town which is inhabited by ghouls and monsters who eagerly count each day until the next Halloween. Jack longs for something different and discovers Christmas which is ironically the polar opposite of Halloween. Jack and the rest of Halloween Town decide to give Christmas a try. Underneath the main plot of taking over Christmas, there is a love story between Jack and Sally. Sally is a creation of the Evil Scientist. She also longs for something different just as Jack does, but feels his plan will not work.The visual aspect of Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is probably what it is most remembered for. This is the first movie to consist entirely of stop motion animation. Stop motion animation is one of the hardest things to do, and it takes a very long time. You would have figures or something else and you would take a picture of them. Then you would move them slightly and take another picture. You would repeat this over and over. I believe each second of the film is about 24 pictures. Different images, such as Jack and Sally on the hill, will stay with you for the rest of your life. The music by Danny Elfman is another factor which makes this movie great. Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is an excellent movie for all ages."
"The voice acting was great, and so were the characters. Even the minor characters that didn't speak felt authentic! I loved the children the fatty, and the demon child. Personally my favorite character was the Demon (the red one). There were twists, and turns, and most everyone was dead. That added to the effect of the town of all hallows eve. the most surprising part was when jack was shot down (which sucked). The songs were simply delightful, which makes this my all time favorite When i watch this it gives me the impression that doctor Seuss had an evil (but slightly more realistic) twin. In short this is the best musical of the age, and it has us all singing out it's Christmas time!"
"Jack is a skeleton living in a scary faraway dimension where bizarre creatures reside and embark to scare children on Halloween every year. But Jack longs for a different life outside the restraints of horror - he doesn't like who he is. One day he wanders outside the limits of the haunted city and through a snowy forest, finding Santa Claus and his Elves' workshop.Inspired, Jack decides to kidnap Santa Claus and turn Christmas into Halloween.The ads for this movie were always very grim. It used to boast, ""From producer Tim Burton!"" and his influence is very clear - extremely Gothic visuals. And, for a children's tale, some pretty scary stuff! Overall this is style over substance, as are most films associated with Burton. He rarely delivers great stories and instead relies on fairytale clichÃ©s (Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, etc.).There's nothing wrong with this. It works because his films are so nice to look at.This is a fun movie with good visuals and an interesting twist on a familiar tale. I recommend it, as long as you don't expect something emotionally involving or brilliant story-wise."
Yes this is a Burton's film. Yes I am aware that he was not the director. But as the producer and the creator of the story and characters he had a singular impact on the final product. More to the point it feels like a Burton film. In fact it feels like THE Burton film. It has all of his hallmarks in design and atmosphere. It even has his typical weakness in story and narrative. This is the film I would show to someone experiencing Burton for the first time. It is dark whimsy personified.This is a classic holiday film and Elfman's score makes it highly re-watchable. I watch it every November to split the difference between Halloween and Christmas.
"""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is not my favorite Disney or Favorite Tim Burton film however, it's pretty damn close. This film is so nostalgic for me, and I felt this film deserved a spot on this list. This film is actually not directed by Tim Burton, it's directed by Henry Selick, who also did ""Coraline"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"". Though, Tim Burton did create the entire story and all the characters. This movie has some of the greatest music ever put in a film, especially ""Jack's Lament"", which is my favorite track. Danny Elfman voiced Jack's singing voice, but they had Chris Sarandon do the dialogue. The film is beautifully shot, and contains some very impressive stop-motion. Overall, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is probably the most iconic stop-motion of all-time, and has some of the most iconic imagery ever put on film."
Nightmare before christmas is a very good its creepy its fun to watch with your friends and family love it so much
"When this film was released in 1993 Disney Distant themselves from this. They removed the ""Walt Disney"" presents from the credits and released it under their TOUCHSTONE picture label. The reality is they had no idea that they had one of the best films the studio has ever released. Tim Burton was the executive producer of this film. He came up with the idea. However in 1992 he released ""Batman Returns"" and that film got major backlash for the dark tone it had/ ""The Night Before Christmas"" has a dark tone to it but it is very very funny. Most of all it has the best original scores to ever be made for a film. In this film Halloween Town, is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington (""The Pumpkin King"") leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to ""Christmas Town."" Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his (somewhat limited) understanding of the festivities to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Things go wrong very fast when Jack start delivering his idea of Christmas Toys. After the film was released on Home Video the film really started to gained a foothold on audiences. Once they saw it ""They loved it"". Then Disney finally put there name on the film after the film became such an icon of not only ""Halloween"" but ""Christmas"" as well. The film is so well made and it is never boring. The songs in this film are very catchy. Not exactly a huge hit when it was released in 1993 the film however has gone on to be a best seller on home video every year!"
"Growing up in the 90's, I never heard of Tim Burton until a few years later, as a teenage, I watched most of them, but while some of his films are good, I think that the best Burton film would have to be this, a stop-motion animated film about a pumpkin king who turns Halloween into Christmas.Now, when I had the VHS copy of this film, I got really terrified at most parts in which they're very scary, but to my surprise, it was a well-put together film and it's a classic that still holds up to today on it's 20th anniversary. My only nitpick is that it's a bit too short, but there's a lot of good things about this classic.The story is original and a nice concept that is well-done. The animation is great and the visuals are solid. From Halloween Town to the North Pole and everything else is detailed very nicely. The character models are great and the characters themselves are great too. Not to mention the voice acting for the characters is really impressive.Chris Sarandon and Catherine O'Hara as Jack Skellington and Sally, the rag doll, are great and the romance between them is so cute. The other characters are well-voiced, but Oogie Boogie steals the show for being an entertaining villain voiced perfectly by Ken Page (who voiced King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven). The singing voice for Jack from Danny Elfman is great and in fact, the songs are very catchy in an animated musical since the times of Disney.""This Is Halloween"", ""What's This?"", ""Sally's Song"", and ""The Oogie Boogie Song"" along with others are catchy and memorable to this day. The music score from Danny Elfman is great with a mixture of dark, Gothic, whimsical, and comedic that is done perfectly well. The tone is solid too with it's dark and scary moments and it's hilarious and light- hearted moments.Overall, A Nightmare Before Christmas is a classic worth recommending to those who haven't seen it yet before Halloween will end and will always be a classic to those who grew up with it. Thumbs up!"
"I have never liked stop-motion and clay things, but this is one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie is so fluent, I couldn't tell it was stop-motion and obviously it is so beautifully done. Anywhere you look there is something to behold. Also, the characters look incredible and how they even move alone is really fascinating and cool. Jack moves a lot like a spider, and Sally is clumsy (like me!). It's so cool to just look at.Beside from visuals, the music/lyrics I believe are incredible. This is Halloween is so fun with clowns who can tear away their face and monsters hiding under your bed while remaining not frightening for children. Jack's Lament is such a wonderful song with a touching message we all know too well: getting tired of the same old thing. Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones/An emptiness began to grow/There's something out there, far from my home/A longing that I've never known. Some lyrics from Jack's Lament (my favorite song in the movie.) When Sally sings her little song, I almost cry; it is so emotional. We established the songs are amazing.The plot is so original and creative; I can't helped to be drawled in. Who else would think of a Halloween Town person discovering Christmas other than Tim Burton? And the characters are some of the most interesting I've seen. Jack Skellington is so easy to relate to, lovable, and so determined, making him one of my favorite characters of all time. I'm not ashamed to admit I have a necklace of him. (: Sally is interesting too as well as with all the other characters.REALLY A MUST SEE!"
"I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time when it was released for the first time; I was nine years old. Growing up in a country where whatever knowledge I had of Christmas and Halloween came from American TV, I missed a lot of the jokes and a lot of the references, but I enjoyed the colorful characters, zany adventure and dark slapstick. I loved it.I watched it again when I was 16 and going to art school, during a lecture about adult animation. This time I enjoyed the stylish design, the meticulously made stop-motion animation and the infectious songs. Loved it.And I watched it for a third time when I was 22 and studying design. I now knew the careers of both Henry Selick and Tim Burton back to front, and could appreciate just how much of a landmark the film was for both of them. I could also appreciate the subtle pokes at American culture, and the clever homage to both classic animated Christmas specials and German expressionist cinema. Loved it.I now tend to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas approximately once a year. It's not a tradition or anything, I still don't celebrate Christmas or Halloween. There just always seems to be some good reason to watch it, as it's one of the shortest, quickest, and most enjoyable of my all time favorite films. And I enjoy it every time. It's wildly imaginative, beautifully animated in stop-motion animation that isn't likely to age any time soon, gorgeously designed and wonderfully scored. It refused to acknowledge the idea that an animated film has to make a choice between kids' and adults' animation; it's directed at mature and intelligent kids, and at young-at-heart adults, two years before Pixar started making films that made the same choice.Most of all, The Nightmare Before Christmas remains one of a kind. Burton tried to recreate the magic with Corpse Bride and failed miserably. It's funny, it's filled with sarcasm but also surprisingly touching and idealistic. It's the best movie Tim Burton never made, and it will always be one of my all time favorites."
"There's really not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I'm of the opinion that Tim Burton is a genius. The visual style of this film is so simple and a dark kind of exquisite. I actually cared about the characters, something that's rare for me in an animated film. There were so many little nuances in the film that I just adore. But my favorite thing about the movie is Danny Elfman. His singing voice is absolutely beautiful and it just furthered my belief that he's a genius musician. The score is just exquisite. There's really not much more I can say about it, except that it's a true masterpiece and is right up there with Edward Scissorhands."
"I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but the influence of the Kurt Weill- Bertolt Brecht collaboration with some of the selections from their Threepenny Opera (German title: Die Dreigroschenoper) can be heard in the music of Nightmare Before Christmas. The atmosphere of the Threepenny Opera is invoked several times throughout this wonderful animated film. Listen to ""Mr. Peachum's Morning Hymn"" (Der Morgenchoral des Peachum), ""The Instead-Of Song"" (Anstatt-Dass Song), ""Ballad About the Question: 'What Keeps a Man Alive'"" (Ballade Ã¼ber die Frage: ""Wovon lebt der Mensch""), Perhaps the best version of Weill's Threepenny Opera is the one featuring Lotte Lenya on CBS Records Masterworks (Sony). See if you agree."
"This piece was one of the best applications of stop-motion that I have ever seen.  The beauty was in the simplicity of the shots, along with the vivid imagery.  I've never seen a children's story so perverted, simply by the choice of setting.  Oh, what a beautiful piece.  I adored this movie like nothing I have before.  Cartoons just don't hold the same magic that they used to; this movie changed my perceptions of what it meant to be ""animated"".  If you couldn't notice, I loved it.  Watch it.  A lot."
"This movie holds a special place in my heart as the best animated movie I've ever seen. Originally director Tim Burton was set to direct this movie, but due to his work with Batman Returns, stop motion director Henry Selick took over as director while Burton remained producer. I'll be honest, this movie gets more pumped for Halloween than Christmas, it has great atmosphere for both seasons but it may have something to do with the sets for Halloween town and Danny Elfman's Oscar worthy score that have that dark and Gothic feel to it. What I like about this movie is how the plot pays some homage to classic Christmas tales, I mean Jack Skellington being Santa was definitely inspired by the Grinch. The story is about the king of Halloween, Jack Skellington who has grown weary of doing the same thing every year until he comes across a strange place in the woods with trees that represent every other holiday and thus he discovers Christmas. Intrigued, he wants to bring this holiday to his town, however he doesn't quite understand the meaning of Christmas and his ambition and ignorance causes it to backfire. Jack might be the scariest hero ever,why? He's a skeleton, sure he's a nice guy but if he can make you scream like a banshee and jump out of your skin, I'd run. As I said he's ambitious a little ignorant and nice guy, but he's also intimidating for a hero, but hey Halloween, right? Jack's voice is provided by composer Danny Elfman (singing) and Chris ""Humperdinck"" Sarandon (speaking). Elfman gets a little more credit because I'm pretty sure he has more singing lines as opposed to speaking, both actors are perfect for the part in my opinion. Originally they asked Sarandon if he'd sing but he didn't believe he could and thus Elfman got the singing role. Jack also has the love interest, Sally voiced by Catherine O'Hara. Sally is the smartest character in the movie, from drugging her master, making a potion, jumping out a window and stitching herself up, and seeing a vision of Jack's Christmas. She feels empty because she really has nothing but being trapped and part of the emptiness relates her to Jack because he's depressed and weary. Jack decides to take Christmas and has Oogie Boogie's henchmen kidnap Santa and unknown to Jack they take him to Boogie. Eventually Jack goes out into the night to deliver Halloween made toys to kids for Christmas and it goes wrong and the military takes action and shoots him down and he accepts that he is the pumpkin king and goes to rescue Santa and Sally from Boogie and give Christmas back to Santa as he goes to fix Jack's mistakes. Jack returns to Halloween Town as Santa fly's by and wishes them a happy Halloween, Jack realizes how much Sally cared to fix everything and thus they fall in love at the end. I still think the movie holds up really well, the stop motion is phenomenal, the voice acting is great, the songs are amazing, the score is Oscar worthy, the characters are good and a lot are famous Halloween monsters. The romance felt a little shallow I admit, at first I felt Sally fell for Jack because he's just awesome, but it does establish a little connection. I still see this as a Halloween movie and it's atmosphere and score get pumped to dress up and scare people. I also see this as the best stop motion animated feature ever made, I love this movie and whether it gets you excited for Halloween or Christmas I think you'll find enjoyment in this move. I'm gonna grade this movie an A+!"
"The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply pure movie magic. Its stop- motion animation entertains with a seemingly effortless ease, though quite a lot of painstaking artistry was required to bring the world of Jack Skellington to life. It's the story of Jack, the ""Pumpkin King,"" who is essentially the physical embodiment of the spirit of Halloween. After yet another successful Halloween, Jack wanders away from town with his dog Zero, tired of the holiday he has mastered and seeking a new sense of purpose. He stumbles into ""Christmas Town"" and decides to give the people of Halloween Town a new project. Though not overtly political, Nightmare has a progressive quality, both in terms of the daring vision it brings to the screen and in its themes. It's a film about struggling against the boundaries of your environment and pressing for change. And even though Jack's attempt to usurp Christmas is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, he's not wrong to seek new possibilities, and he emerges from the experience a changed skeleton. He's revived and renewed, and with the help of Sally, who loves Jack for who he is, he realizes his ambition was driven by selfishness. In the end, he's wiser, having learned to play his own role well without descending into isolation. After setting things right, Jack is better able to listen to, collaborate with, and connect with others for the benefit of everyone."
"We've seen quite a bit of stop-motion animation on television, with all of those holiday specials we see every Christmas, and of course, the infamous Wallace and Gromit shorts by filmmaker Nick Park in the U.K. However, in the 1990s, we haven't seen a whole lot of stop-motion animation on the big screen. In fact, we rarely saw that. However, one little film came to theatres in 1993 produced by ""Batman"" director Tim Burton and directed by then-newcomer Henry Selick (who would later make ""Coraline"") that really caught our attention. That film was ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"".The movie focuses around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who is tired of doing the same old celebration in Halloween Town year after year, as illustrated and interpreted in the film's second musical number. That's right. This is a musical. He wanders out of Halloween Town to find something new, until he stumbles upon a series of holiday doors in the middle of the forest. The one that catches his eye is a door in the shape of a tree. A Christmas tree as a matter of fact. He opens the door, only to be literally sucked in and discovers Christmas town. Fascinated by his discovery, he tells the citizens of Halloween Town all about it, and comes up with the idea of taking over Christmas this year. What happens after that I will not tell, because there are a certain number of people who have not even seen this fantastic movie yet.Let me make it clear, if the 10/10 score isn't clear enough already if you looked under the summary. I absolutely love this movie. A lot. In fact, it's within the top 10 of my all time favorite movies list (which I have not fully completed yet). Every year since I've gotten the Special Edition DVD at age 15, I've watched this movie numerous times every year, and it still has not gotten old. Even though I never got the opportunity to watch this movie at a younger age (for some reason -.-), waiting until I got my hands on the DVD disc paid off nicely. The structure of the sets and characters are absolutely brilliant and morbid for a stop-motion picture. A lot of care went into the making of this motion picture milestone, even if Tim Burton was absent most of the time. The reason for that was he was directing ""Batman Returns"" for Warner Brothers and he was also in pre-production for the R-rated drama ""Ed Wood"", which would also be released by Touchstone. So, because of this, it was director Henry Selick's job to make sure that Tim Burton's vision was alive and well during production. The result, a movie that defined the mind of Tim Burton as a whole.The music and songs, both done by former Oingo-Boingo front man and film composer Danny Elfman are also the highlight of the film besides the animation and visuals. There are 10 songs in total, and they are performed brilliantly. Danny Elfman also provides the singing voice of Jack Skellington. The music is celebrated to the point where in 2008, Walt Disney Records released a compilation album entitled ""Nightmare Revisited"", with all the songs and motion picture score performed by popular and independent acts, including the likes of Marilyn Manson, Korn, Rise Against, and the All-American Rejects (don't worry parents, it's family-friendly). Bizarre as it is, the compilation is definitely worth a buy if you love the film as much as I do.Today, 20 years later as of this review post, the film still holds up really well. Merchandise went up the wazoo, video games were made, and it even garnered a cult following. Whether you are watching it in 2D or 3D, chances are, you're gonna get the same reaction of amazement on how far we've gotten with filmmaking technology. Back then, animated films didn't solely rely on computer generated images to wow audiences. Craftsmanship and imagination were needed to make a film that can captivate the movie-going public. Granted, this doesn't always mark every single film a success, but in this case, it's what made it a classic. The film may have a few faults, which are really very small nitpicks, but it does not hurt the film one bit. This movie is still fun to watch, and it can be best viewed on Halloween and Christmas. That's right. It's not just a Christmas movie. It's a Halloween treat as well. If you haven't seen this film once in your life, you owe it to yourself to find a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie. If you have kids, it's even better.Before I end this review, I must mention that Disney first released this film under their more adult subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, because they thought the movie would be too scary for younger audiences. In fact, it's what got it the PG rating. Ironically, this is the same studio that released a lesser known horror film called ""The Watcher in the Woods"". What they didn't realize is that kids eat this stuff up like Halloween candy. It wouldn't be until the 3D re-release when Disney themselves would distribute the film."
"I don't know a single person who doesn't love this movie. Tim Burton nailed this one in my eyes, and this is the movie that introduced my generation to him and to claymation as well. I was very young when this movie came out, and yes it scared me but it was the greatest movie ever. This the go-to movie when it's time for Halloween, and Christmas as well, to get you in the spirit! The soundtrack is gold and every song is fantastic and you know most of the words from the first time you see it. It has been almost 20 years since it came out and it still has a cult following, a mega franchise and screaming fans of all ages. Disney was right to pick up the rights for this movie because I guarantee you it has done nothing but given them more money for years to come. It may scare very small children but they will either get over it or come to love it in a couple of years."
"I was a child when I first saw this movie. My father has always been a big fan of Tim Burton, and he couldn't wait to show me this on our brand new VHS. I didn't understand the movie at first because I was so young, and for years I didn't appreciate how much effort went in here. Now that I have actually developed taste, I can share with you my opinion on this revolutionary masterpiece.The plot of ""Nightmare"" is based on the Tim Burton poem of the same name. It's about a Skeleton named Jack who is the king of HalloweenTown, a place where the only holiday is Halloween. Every time the celebrations end up the same, and the whole year is spent preparing for the next Halloween. Jack, being in charge of all this, gets bored and decides that he is no longer going to bother with Halloween. He travels away from town with his ghost dog, Zero, much to the town's dismay.After days of travelling, Jack discovers a group of doors, each one acting as a portal to the different towns representing each holiday. Intrigued, he opens the door the ChristmasTown, and discovers his new favourite holiday. Jack returns triumphantly to HalloweenTown, telling everyone (through the medium of a song) to prepare for something new and exciting: Christmas. As one would expect, the people of HalloweenTown have rather dark visions of Christmas, and with an evil monster named Oogie Boogie in the mix, something's bound to go wrong! The whole movie is brilliantly presented in traditional stop-motion animation, with all 227 character models looking as they should; either bright and colourful Christmas workers or spooky Halloween creeps. Every character, however scary, is lovable from start to finish The music is pure genius and each line falls on top of the backing like brandy on a pudding. Danny Elfman does a great job as Jack's singing voice, which is expected considering he wrote the songs and therefore knows exactly how they should sound.Considering all these great elements of a movie, I would definitely dub it as a must-see and my favourite Christmas movie of all time. I watch it every Christmas Eve and will no doubt do so for years to come."
"This is a very special film on several levels. On a personal level, this is the first movie I ever truly fell in complete love with as a child. On a technical level, ""Nightmare"" is really an achievement because making a 76 minute film with claymation in 1993 probably was a nightmare comparable to what the production crew of ""Jaws"" faced. On a musical level, this is the best movie-musical of all time, in my opinion. Danny Elfman's score is one of the best ever written. Also, this is a milestone film in terms of story and characters. If ""Nightmare"" were filmed in live-time without the music, it wouldn't have the magic that put it #3 on my list, but it would still be a well developed, quirky story. As I say in every review, the most important part of film a film is its character development and its finale. Henry Selick and Tim Burton take characters that seem very unlikeable and make them personable. I actually think that the humble love story between Jack and Sally is the most romantic love story in film history. It's innocent. The entire film is innocent. A child could sit down and appreciate this film as I did, or an adult could do the same. It's colorful in a literal sense and a figurative sense. Also, ""Nightmare"" has the greatest opening sequence of all time, in my opinion. ""This is Halloween"" is undeniably creepy, and all of our Halloween archetypes spring to life before our eyes, promising an exciting hour and 15 minutes. Boogie is one of the most delicious villains of all time. He's just so rotten, you have to love him. His song with Santa Claus is priceless--there's something about the boogeyman singing a jazz number to Santa Claus that fills me with glee. Despite the darkness of the Halloween theme, Burton and Selick bring unimaginable beauty to the screen. Christmas town is straight from a child's (or Tim Burton's) dreams. The ending is also beautiful, but we won't talk about that in a review. The whole point of going to the films is to be taken somewhere that you can't really go. If there ever were a film that does that, this is it."
"A dark, but enjoyable animated holiday tale by Tim Burton that's brought to life with the quality music of Danny Elfman's. Jack Skellington is the king of Halloween Town. After discovering Christmas town, he tries his best to bring Christmas to his neck of the woods. It brings us a good, new holiday story, but it's the stunning animation and music that give this movie it's edge. It's a feast for the senses and highly enjoyable to watch even with it's dark tones. *** (Out of 4)"
"The first time I saw this movie back in 93', I didn't like it that much. Then, a year ago, I viewed it again and my eyes were opened to one of the most charming, catchy, fun, artistically brilliant films I've EVER seen. The animation is absolutely uncanny. It marvelously sets a mood that has no equal. Danny Elfman, one of my favorite composers, really busts his butt to pull the music and lyrics off and he succeeds gloriously. One of the most exquisitely composed movies of all time. I know ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is only an hour and fifteen minutes, but it certainly seem much longer than that. That is because there is not a dull moment in the whole movie. It dares not to take take a breath and slow down. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going, and going, and going. I cannot stress enough how much eye candy the film contains. I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, it would have been quite a visual experience. Tim Burton's style is apparent throughout, and there's not much lame, sentimental, Disney-esque stuff in it. What is there is a small ozone layer of warmth that envelops the whole package and delivers an original, heart-warming, and visually breath-taking masterpice of cinema. It is, and will continue to be a classic of epic proportions. A masterpiece.       10/10"
"The Burton/Elfman team did it again. This film is a must-see for Halloween, Christmas, and any other time of the year. Not a single point of weakness, this is as good as it gets and tops any expectation. Poetic, humorous, visually stunning, multilayered, a musical masterpiece and so beautiful it will make your heart bleed, this film is rather dark amd tragic however and not entirely suitable for the youngest among us. I don't think it ever was intended to be. A stunning poetic interpretation and a personal favourite."
"When i first saw the nightmare before Christmas i got dazzled by the soundtrack, i bought it recently and i haven't stopped listening to it since i got it.Danny Elfman is a genius, and i hope that Tim Burton and Danny Elfman will keep up the good work and keep on showing how good they are together.p.s. My best song on the soundtrack is (What's this) when Jack discovers Christmas Town for the first time and when Jack and Sally are singing together in the end of the movie on the hill.Please send me your opinions of this amazing soundtrack!"
"I remember seeing previews for this movie and thinking it looked stupid. The closer it got to the opening, I changed my mind. Then I saw the film and fell in love with it. I had never seen anything like it. It is wonderful! The script is great, the acting and singing are great, the stop action is great. And it is quite humorous. I cannot gush enough about this movie. My favorite character was Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. He has a great idea, he just didn't know how to make it work. I also liked the love story between him and Sally the rag doll. From the beginning you can tell that she is in love with Jack; he does not realize his feelings (or hers) until the end. And the Oogie Boogie scenes are a hoot to watch! This movie also has addicting and memorable songs such as 'This is Halloween,' 'What's This?,' and 'Kidnap the Sandy Claws.' You will be singing them for a week after!If you haven't seen this movie, see it. It is a must for Halloween and the holiday season. As I said before, I cannot gush enough about this movie."
"People only give this high reviews because they're blinded by nostalgia. Me, having only watched this movie recently, actually see the problems in this movie that everyone else here is blind to. This movie wasn't terrible - the music and animation were very good - but what this movie lacks is any kind of importance in anything. Sally had basically no character, but the movie acts like she's important. Sally's relationship with the main character Jack Skellington was also completely forced. They had absolutely no chemistry with each other, the only time they even talked with each other was when Sally was warning Jack about how his desire to become Santa Claus was a bad idea. And speaking of him wanting to be Santa, that's the plot of the movie. But barely any of the movie even follows this plot, it just wanders off into these musicals and scenes of Sally doing meaningless things. Overall, 3/10 - only because of the animation and music."
"I just never found this story to be appealing, and I gave it several chances as I usually find Tim Burton movies visual feasts and interesting, even if I don't agree with his bias.Maybe I never was comfortable with an animated film being so dark. Even some of the songs had dark and mean-spirited lyrics. It did get better after the first 45 minutes with ""Jack"" trying to be Santa Claus but delivering the wrong kind of toys. Santa Claus won out in the end, which was good to see, and there was a nice little romantic ending between Jack and ""Sally."" It's an inventive film, to be sure, with a lot of clever animation, especially for its day (it's now over a dozen years old) but I just got too many bad vibes watching this. Sorry. There are lighter, nicer animated films - at least for kids - to watch than this."
"The Nightmare Before Christmas is THE best movie ever made. The animation is wonderful, life-like, and very detailed. The storyline is absolutely great... that is, if you like the idea of the King of Halloween taking over ""Sandy Claws's"" job (Halloween is my favorite holiday ever, so this is an excellent plan in my eyes). And even though he is a skeleton, Jack Skellington is inquisitive, breath-taking, and incredibly sexy ;)! The movie also contains awesome musical scores performed by Danny Elfman (also works with the Simpsons) and Catherine O'Hara (in this year's Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events). If you haven't seen the movie, or even if you have, then I definitely recommend that you watch it (again)!"
"This movie is brilliant. It isn't just a family film in that it's isn't just for kids or the PG crowd. It's dark tone will appeal to adults and mature audiences. However the dark tone is nothing a child can't handle or probably even notice. The movie is about Halloween!!!!! So stop with it's too dark. If you don't let your kid out on Halloween then fine don't let them see this. Go back to your 24hr brain-wash coddle fest. Stick to Barney and most of the Disney catalog.But if you like to feed you and your child's imagination GO SEE THIS MOVIE!This is the Disney movie that Disney rightfully should not claim as their own. However, it is more Disney in spirit than any Disney film produced in the past twenty years.It is innovative and original. Disney is not anymore. Only productions made outside of their creative stranglehold are any good. (This and the Toy Story movies).Visually, this has to be the most original animated movie ever. Only Tim Burton could of done this and thank god he did.I have watched this movie about ten times and every time I find something new. Something you parents might want to keep in mind, when your child wants to watch this again.
I usually hate songs in movies but these are catchy and kind of sarcastic so they aren't the dreaded formulaic - bad - Broadway wannabe- bathroom break - catnaps that are usually present in EVERY Disney animated movie of the last 11 years.
This movie drips with creativity and heart. Down to the tiniest detail you can tell the animators put their soul into this. Instead of the assembly line animation of Disney's latest merchandising juggernaut.If you like Tim Burton see this. If you are tired of being patronized by Disney see this. If your kid has any kind of imagination and intelligence, shut off the Lion King and make them see this.
Note: DVD has a great picture and sound and is the best way to appreciate this landmark and classic animated film."
"This movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special. This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probubly the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are postioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is  takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that exsplains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch!"
"My wife and two kids, boys aged 9 and 12, settled down together to watch this and at the halfway point we all agreed to bail on it.Part of the problem is that much of the explication is given in song, so unless you're on top of interpreting screechy singing voices you will be a bit lost. And I didn't really care about any of the characters ... there was a girl who was important somehow but I had no idea of what her motivation was. Her creator was a pretty good evil guy, though.My kids thought it was creepy, so I guess the film had some power, but just not the kind of power that would make us want to watch it."
"I abstained from Nightmare Before Christmas for years because (much like The Goonies) it has just been forced into popular culture, where I don't think it belongs. Neither film was massively popular or a critical success on their original release, but somewhere along the line the spirit of the films were hijacked.I hate seeing forlorn-looking, middle-class emo teenagers wearing Jack Skellington T-shirts as much as I hate the same crowd yelling ""Hey you, guys."" Were they even born when these films were made? Back to the film itself, it's a rather simple tale of a Halloween-themed world being exposed to the magic of Christmas. Jack Skellington and the denizens of Halloweentown welcome the magic, but no one really seems to understand that the macabre of Halloween and the Spirit of Christmas are utterly incongruous. I suppose this is a commentary on the inconsistency of what the public desires and how we are all easily programmed to like what the media tells us to like.The thin story is interspersed with several, generic Danny Elfman melodies and songs. The characters are amusing, especially the Mayor of Halloweentown, who's double-sided head periodically rotates between happiness and despair. And the atmosphere is also very nice, but I'm undecided if it's a Halloween film or an Xmas film.Overall, it's good, but not great. It's more like The Trap Door than it's like Wallace and Gromit, but still a pleasant distraction for the Xmas season."
"I watched this movie for the first time the day after Halloween as a sort of bridge from the spooky season to the Christmas season. After finishing It, I had a couple thought. First of all, the animation is a feast for the eyes and the music is phenomenal. Tim Burton is an artistic genius and the effects and music were thoroughly satisfying. That being said, I felt it was way too short. The action rose and fell far too quickly, and the high drama at the end felt forced. The crux of the plot came to easily and too soon. If they had made it a little longer and deeper, the film would be perfect. But that should in no way stop you from seeing this. It's a great spooky Christmas flick for your older kids and parents."
"Having been a great fan of Tim Burton's work for years, I found this movie relatively late, but I don't believe that has influenced at all my opinion on the movie.No matter whether we're in 1993 or in 2005, Tim Burton's genius is as brilliant in this movie as he is in Corpse Bride or in most of his films. Like no one else, he captures beauty in the most horrible places and the most terrible looking creatures, and he warms our hearts with that beauty.In The Nightmare Before Christmas again he transforms a nightmarish world into something cheerful and insanely merry, where there is always a place for love. It's this inversion of probable scenarios and the complexity of the main characters, in opposition to the supporting ones who are usually type characters, that makes the world of Tim Burton's creations so appetizingly interesting for children as well as for adults.And don't forget the delicious songs by Danny Elfman, for me the best and most subversive musical creator in Hollywood. I can't imagine anyone else making soundtracks for Burton's movies."
"Jack Skellington is the King of Halloween Town.  He reminds me of a cross of The Neverhood's Klaymen and Skullmonkeys'... well, skullmonkeys.  Mr. Skellington has a great voice, too.  He's tall and thin, just what all women want in a guy.And atop his shoulders is a skull.To put it plainly, Jack Skellington is really cool.  His voice actor, Chris Sarandon (The Princess Bride's Prince Humperdinck) is marvelous.  His singing actor, Danny Elfman, is one of my favorite composers.But this review is not about Jack Skellington.  No, unfortunately, I have to talk about the movie as well.  Spoilers may arise.  If they do, forgive me.I enjoyed the concept of The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Jack Skellington is bored with Halloween and wants to try something new.  He stumbles into Christmas Town (and sings the best song in the movie... I'm guessing it is titled ""What's This?"" but I could be wrong), where he finds strange, yet not so frightening ideas.  This sparks a new motive for Jack--improve Christmas!Now, from here on out, there are SO many things this movie could do.  Yet it doesn't do much with it.  For most of the film we see them preparing for Christmas and, to be quite honest, it gets rather boring.  The clay is really fun to look at but it's not enough to keep one interested.  The movie doesn't have enough story.  The plot is great, yes, but the actual events could have been better.The climax is pretty exciting, what with Jack facing Oogie Boogie (is that his name?) and all.  But that was hardly enough!  The confrontation was very short.  It was intense for the few seconds it occurred, but was like Attack of the Clones' climax.  Cut way too short.I found the characters creepy and frightening--my stomach churned at the sight of some of them.  Greg Proops, marvelous actor in Whose Line is it Anyway?, is in there somewhere, but I couldn't hear is voice.  Pity.  He wasn't in it enough.I'd say that The Nightmare Before Christmas is excellent and very enjoyable, but I can't.  I'd love to, but I can't.  The singing was tiresome (except for that one song I mentioned) and the story too shallow.  I'm going to say it was fair, but not one to drool over.  Not awful, but not all that great, either.Although I would suggest it.  It's nice to see once or maybe even twice."
"From Henry Selick (JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH) and the master of horror Tim Burton (SLEEPY HOLLOW) comes the greatest Halloween and Christmas classic of all time. Talk about a creative mixture, this movie is one of the most ingenious films ever made. It takes place in the dark, horrific city of Halloween Town, where everything is scary, ghoulish and gloomy (just the way I like it). The movie is overrun with vampires, werewolves, skeletons, and undead children roaming the streets. And it leaves me with one thing: this movie is one of the coolest things I have ever seen!While the movie is not really a kids movie, it is kid friendly. The dialogue is friendly (no swear words) and the story is also friendly for the younger ones. What is not friendly is the ghoulish and gothic images (which are absolutely awesome!) and the horrific cast of Halloween characters that do things with items such as devices of torture, severed heads and other things like that. I know it sounds stupid, but this really is something your kids should not be seeing. I really don't care, let them see it, it is one of the coolest things I have ever seen. Just be advised that some of the scary elements might be a little much for their simple minds to handle. This movie is definetley good for a change of pace, especially when there hasn't been a good classic like this in a long, long time. I also recommend JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH.THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS gets 5/5."
This movie will make you reconnect with your inner child. It's flawless. The musical genius of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton's passion for gothic art makes it the most magical Christmas and Halloween movie of all time. Unsurpassable chef d'oeuvre
"My fascination with this movie is directly tied into a strong childhood connection I have with it. I remember being 7 years old and this movie came out. It was not your typical animation ""kiddie"" type story. I was lured in by this being something different. This gave kids at the time a window into the macabre and adults something to marvel at as well. The stopmotion was beautifully constructed and that alone, anyone can appreciate.I've seen many articles and debates about the plot. What is the message of the story? Is Jack a hero or villain? Are we teaching kids not to pursue something new?So, these questions may be more closely connected than we think.
Jack is actually a very deep character. He is, for lack of a better word, human - in the sense that he does yearn for something better than what he has - when he has it at his fingertips he does what a lot of people do. He gets tunnel vision on this one goal and very selfishly pursues that goal. He does not take the time to consider who this affects along the way.I think people portray this behavior quite often. Someone wants a better job, house, etc...
If you want something badly enough and it's in your grasp, people may step on some toes to get there - not thinking long enough about who it affects until it's too late.This is what makes Jack the deep and totally relatable character that he is. He's too layered to call him a ""hero"" or ""villain"". My best analysis is that he's good guy at heart, but has some very poor judgment about how to pursue his vision.Anyone that's ever exercised some poor judgment can relate to the story of Jack Skellington. And will also have tons of fun along the way - the music, voice acting, art direction, etc... all will be taken in to enjoy.I now watch my son marvel at the movie with the same intrigue I had. It's really special."
There is something elusive and attractive in this cartoon. I would like to advise everyone to see it.
"Saw it again recently, and stop-motion will always be better than full on digital, it lacks that feeling of time, it can't feel outdated, that really stands out, most digital animation will look dated in 5-10 years time. This kind of movies have a timeless feeling to them and it makes them all the better. Amazing soudtrack too, every part reminds me of my childhood. It's a must see."
"This film is fantastic!The filmmaking on display is astonishing and bursting with personality. I am amazing by the skill and craftsmanship on display from Halloweentown to the Christmas Village, to the real world. I used to hate this film when I was little, but as I've gotten older and learned about filmmaking, I keep finding aspects to appreciate in this classic film. The music, animation, story, voice acting, and ending are all excellent.I have no complaints, Watch this masterpiece if you haven't already."
"I was not allowed to see this as a kid because my Mom thought this would be too scary. At first, she was right. Now, I have seen this numerous times! My cousin gave me his DVD and now this is ""our"" movie-we discuss it a lot. I can't count how many times I have seen it-it's probably double digits! However, i must say that little kids should not see this until they are about 6 or 7, or until they understand that it is just a cartoon and not real. Songs like This Is Halloween or Kidnap The Sandy Claws and countless images throughout the movies can scare children-hence why it was one of the few Disney movies of the time to get a a PG rating. But the PG should stand for perfectly great!"
"Ever since I was very little, this has been my favorite movie of all time. I absolutely love Halloween, it's everyday for me, and this movie is, as many would probably argue, the most classic Halloween movie of all time. Not only that, but it can also be watched at Christmas time, though I see it as more of a Halloween movie because even though there are Christmas scenes and the movie takes in November and December leading up to Christmas Eve, with only the first portion of the movie being on Halloween night, even the Christmas scenes in the movie have more of a Halloween vibe to them than Christmas. The movie follows Jack Skellington, the king of Halloween, who after years of the same routine of scaring people, gets tired of this and finds out about Christmas. In his efforts to celebrate Christmas in Halloween Town, instead of celebrating it in a joyful way, they turn it into a fright filled holiday. The stop motion animation is outstanding in this movie, as well as the displays. Each Holiday Town shown in the movie, Halloween Town and Christmas Town, capture the feelings of each holiday so well. Christmas Town is very bright, happy, and joyful with many stripes and bright colors. Halloween Town has a very dark, depressing, and eerie vibe, with oddly shaped gothic buildings, tombstones, and lots of blacks, greys, and oranges. The music in this movie is also amazing. There is only one true Christmas song in the movie which is ""What's This"" song by Jack Skellington when he discovers Christmas, but it stills helps establish the feel of Christmas time very well. There's many bells, harps, and other light hearted music in this song. All of the other songs in the movie are Halloween songs, and they are amazing. They each have very dark and creepy sounding instruments used, such as violins, cellos, saxophones, and other instruments of that matter. This movie is an absolute must see for any Halloween fans or anyone looking for a great movie to watch around Halloween."
"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy drama starring Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickley, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, and Glenn Shadix. The Plot: Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon), a resident from ""Halloween Town"" who stumbles through a portal to ""Christmas Town"" and decides to celebrate the holiday with disastrous consequences. The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, when Burton was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Burton's ""Vincent"" in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to contemplate whether to release The Nightmare Before Christmas as a short film or a 30-minute TV Special. Many years passed, and Tim Burton developed thoughts about this project more and more over time. He made a deal with Disney in the year 1990. The production for the movie started in July of 1991 in San Francisco, California, USA. Disney decided to release the film through the Touchstone Pictures banner stating that they thought that The Nightmare Before Christmas would be ""too frightening for kids."" The film was a huge success, grossing $76.2 million over its theatrical run on a budget of $18,000,000. Danny Elfman's film score and his singing voice for Jack is absolutely amazing. This is for sure director Henry Selick's masterpiece and his best film. It was nominated the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the first for an animated film. An absolute masterpiece and my favorite christmas movie and holiday movie of all-time. 10/10."
"BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA.I saw this film in 1993. I was a huge ""Beetlejuice"" fan and with Tim Burton behind this film I knew it would be a fun film. I had no idea how much I would enjoy this.The Nightmare Before Christmansis deeper, darker and more brilliant than ever -- just as Tim Burton originally envisioned it. Can Christmas be saved? Bored with the same old scare-and-scream routine, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, longs to spread the joy of Christmas. But his merry mission puts Santa in jeopardy and creates a nightmare for good little boys and girls everywhere!This is one of the best films Disney Animation has ever made. Yes t was weird & scary images throughout but that was the plan. The original songs composed for this film are also very clever. Those songs to this day are still under appreciated. Listen to the lyrics. That not only help move story along but they are also the funniest things in this film.I think people are so unaware that in 1993 that Disney kind of disowned this film. The marketing push by the studio was very small! In fact Disney did not put there name on the film. They released under their ""TOUCHSTONE PICTURES"" label! After the film became popular Disney finally put their name on the film (and removed the Touchstone Label)! Eventually they incorporated the characters into Disneyland's popular Haunted Mansion attraction for Halloween time. This is a well made film. Watch & Enjoy!"
"This is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tim Burton, purveyor of the wacko, has created, along with his amazing team, a real classic work. Seldom does a film bank on so much originality, from the incredible creation of Halloween Town, with its denizens, marvelous in their diversity and variety, to a really interesting plot. The character of Jack Skellington is a scene-stealer. Considering he pretty much a stick with a round, skeletal head, he has amazing expression and energy. He is an artist and a rebel, dissatisfied with the continuing shortsightedness of his frightening peers. When his world opens up through an accidental fall into another town, paralleling his own, he tries to bring Christmas back with him. The problem is that he really doesn't understand the concept well enough. He mixes his own social foundation with an alien one and the results are hilarious. Wonderful to look at with some of the finest animation you will ever see, each moment carefully scripted and produced."
