"Aladdin is such an awesome move that still gets me excited to this day, I remember when I was 7 and I saw this in the theater and I just had so much fun. I am such a dork, I still love a lot of the Disney movies that I loved as a kid, but I think the reason that I love Aladdin so much is because this is one of the last Disney movies that was hand drawn animation, the reason I love hand drawn animation is because it feels more personal and that the crew put their heart and soul into it, you can tell by watching it. They got a great cast of voice actors including Scott Weinger from Full House and the always entertaining and hilarious Robin Williams. Robin was just a perfect choice for Genie, he brought a lot of energy to the movie and makes the genie a great character. Who knew that a kid's version of the Arabian Nights tale could be so great? This is a great Disney movie that I guarantee you're going to love.On a dark night, when Jafar attempts to access the Cave of Wonders, a magical cave which holds treasures beyond the wildest belief, above all is a magical oil lamp containing a genie is hidden. He and his talking parrot, Iago, learn that the only one who can enter the Cave of Wonders is the metaphorical ""Diamond in the Rough"". Meanwhile, in the palace of Agrabah, Jasmine, the beautiful teenage daughter of the Sultan, must be married before her upcoming birthday, but she rejects every prince she meets, as she wants to be married for true love and not merely for wealth. Later, Jasmine, frustrated with having her life lived for her climbs over the palace walls, and sees the marketplace for the first time, where she meets the street urchin Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, and the two young people are seen to be falling for each other. Jafar uses a machine to see that the ""diamond in the rough"" is Aladdin. Jafar sends a group of guards to capture Aladdin while Jasmine is still with him. Jasmine tells Jafar to release him, but Jafar lies and tells her he is already dead. Jafar, disguised as an elderly man, releases Aladdin from prison and leads him to the Cave of Wonders. They are told by the tiger-shaped head of the cave to touch nothing but the lamp. Aladdin enters the cave and encounters a magic carpet before finding the lamp. Abu tries to steal a ruby and causes the cave to start collapsing, but the carpet helps them to the entrance. Jafar takes the lamp from them and tries to kill them but Abu takes the lamp back and bites his arm, causing him to knock Abu back into the cave just as it collapses. When Aladdin awakens, Abu gives him the lamp which he had snatched from Jafar. After rubbing it, a genie is unleashed, revealing that he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin dupes the genie into freeing them from the cave without using up a wish. While contemplating his wishes, Aladdin asks the genie to make him into a prince so he can marry Jasmine. Iago later steals the genie's lamp back and brings it to Jafar, who becomes the genie's new master and uses his first wish to become sultan. Jafar then wishes to become a powerful sorcerer, Jafar then keeps the Sultan, the Genie, and Jasmine as his slaves. Aladdin must figure a way to save all of them and make things right again.Aladdin is just a great movie that I promise you'll love, it has great characters, beautiful animation, and a terrific and catchy soundtrack that you'll be singing all day. This was one of the rare Disney movies that you pretty much loved ALL the characters, even Iago who is voiced by Gilbert Gottfried, the voice is a bit much but he is great as well. I personally love both the carpet and the genie. Who knew that a carpet could have so much personality? I absolutely adore the ""Friend Like Me"" scene, it was incredible to watch and had terrific animation! If for some odd reason you haven't somehow seen this movie, I highly recommend that you do, this will probably go down in your favorites as well.10/10"
"I grew up watching this film and along with Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella it is one of my favourite Disney films. I love it! Robin Williams is so good in it. He's hilarious. This film isn't just for kids but for the whole family. I think I was about 5 when I first saw it and at 14 I still watch it and so do my parents. I haven't seen the sequels because I heard that Robin Williams wasn't in them and decided that they wouldn't be as good without him. He was made for the part. The songs are amazing. I love singing along to ""A Whole new World"". I'm hoping to get the soundtrack soon. I also love the film because I have the same name as the princess in it! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You're never too old to watch a classic Disney film."
"This movie has three elements that are important for an animated Disney movie: Great songs, a good villain and a great sidekick.The songs and music in general are just great and very memorable. Jafar is a great villain mainly because he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman who has got a good and scary voice. But what is maybe the best element of the movie is Robin Williams as the blue genie. The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can't stop again and keeps you laughing.The story is good and the pace is high. ""Aladdin"" is not too short and it's not too long, it's not too immature and it's not too mature, it's a perfect movie for the entire family with a wonderful love story (even though it's no ""Beauty and the Beast"") and good animations with some good looking early computer effects.9/10"
"I will never forget the first time I watched ""Aladdin"", I was with a group of friends waiting in the airport for the plane that would take us from Orlando to Paris at the time when ""Aladdin"" was the 'big thing' in the USA while some previews of ""The Lion King"" were starting to screen. ""Aladdin"" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out ""The Jungle Book"".I know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes ""Aladdin"" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. ""Aladdin"" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.""Kid's day in the USA!"" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered ""Aladdin"", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.Needless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time  it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.And for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.I must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for ""Aladdin"" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.And then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see  and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.I feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for ""Aladdin"".But maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of ""Aladdin"", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?"
"Simply a classic. The movie Aladdin is hilariously told with many many MANY funny moments. The genie his an all-time high in this classic film about a street rat and a princess. A great movie for young kids, but even adults will love the wonderfully amusing lines throughout the story. The songs in the movie are well-known and catchy. I even had a guy since one of them to a girl at a school dance! Everyone recognizes them, and it is our duty to make sure the next generations continues to appreciate such a wonderful work of art.A great movie for the entire family to sit down and watch together, it's good sometimes to take a blast to the past and enjoy some of those good ol' movies."
"I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day. The villain is an ""Oil Can Harry"" mustached dastardly employee of the king who desires king-like powers. His scenes, however, are tempered with humor thanks to his New York City-sounding obnoxious parrot, who provides most of the movie's slapstick humor.Maybe the best attribute of this film is simply how fast it moves, meaning it's very, very entertaining."
"I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big Robin Williams that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with Paula Abdul as Jasmine and John De Lancie as Jafar. Jasmine in this movie has the same sexual innocence as Ariel the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World."" The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of Robin Williams and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation. Ten Stars way up!"
"This movie was the biggest film of '92, and it's easy to see why-a lotta fun, as a terrific Robin Williams performance carries it to heights it otherwise would not have gone to. Great animation, fine songs, a decent plot--what is there not to like? I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.A great movie, ***1/2 outta ****, a fave then and now."
"Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"", so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child."
"I think this is one of the funniest films that Disney has ever done. This is due entirely to Robin William's brilliant voice of the Genie. He is wonderful in this role. I think the animation is pretty fair although I dislike the ""generic"" people that Disney's shop is putting out these days. They all share the same basic facial structure and eyes, so there is not much difference between any of the characters. It's not like Sleepy, Doc and Sneezy, who all looked very different. Still, this is a great and funny film. It is totally clean and not very violent so it is appropriate for every member of the family. Give this one a try and you'll have a great time watching it!"
"The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.""Aladdin"" is very entertaining and great fun. It is hilarious, creative, imaginative and romantic. It isn't a faultless movie, but it's a little difficult not to like it.I'll start by talking about the characters. The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling ""Prince Abooboo"" to ""Prince Ali""), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.""Aladdin"" is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.By the way, I absolutely love the song ""A Whole New World"". The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. ""Arabian Nights"" is a nice song as well...I'd only wish that ""Aladdin"" hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.This should definitely be on Top 250."
"Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin.""I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion."
"The film opens with a merchant's tell-tale song, performed by the classic Robin Williams. It begins the (inaccurate, but good) story of a boy named Aladdin, who has the power to open the Cave of Wonders, a place that holds magic and wealth. We don't meet Aladdin yet, as it first introduces us to the villain of the story, the well-written ""Jafar"". Jafar is cunning and witty. He is a classic villain, with a terrifying look and an evil laugh. We are shown Jafar and another man trying to open the Cave of Wonders. Since the other man is not Aladdin, he cannot go into the cave and come out unharmed. Jafar grows angry after learning this fate, and hatches a plan to find Aladdin.Now, we center on a scraggly boy in a marketplace, stealing bread. There's the beautiful singing of Scott Weinger that immediately grabs your heart. Guards are trying to catch Aladdin for stealing. Through this song, you realize the boy is a poor orphan unable to afford food. He owns a pet monkey named Abu, who has an attitude of his own. Aladdin escapes the guards with an allusion to a magic carpet as his escape method, and lands in an alley, while the guards land in manure.Now, one may think Aladdin deserves to be caught for stealing. It's at this moment that Aladdin notices two starving children and gives his own bread to them. Abu does the same, with a little persuasion. I won't give everything away, but what I will say is that this film is something I hold very dear to my heart. Throughout the past 20+ years, it has touched the hearts of many. It's got a great musical score, amazing character development, great voice actresses and actors (including Robin Williams!), and a story that you can't forget. This movie truly is magical."
"Aladdin is one of my favorite movies from Disney, and when I watched it for the first time I was 7 years old. Aladdin is a poor boy and he lives at the streets with his best friend Abu, a little and cute monkey. One day, at the market, he helps Princess Jasmine thinking that she is a regular girl,but under Jafar's orders (sultan's adviser)Aladdin is thrown in jail.Jasmine stays furious with Jafar's orders, but Jafar being an evil bastard, says to her that he asked to kill Aladdin. But many things that Jafar didn't think become true, and one of them is that Aladdin escaped from prison, and is the only person who can enter in a cave where the magical lamp is.(I don't need to say that he is the one who takes the lamp and become Genie's friend) But many things will happen, including Aladdin and Jasmine's meet as prince and princess."

"Ah, Aladdin. The songs, the characters, everything!The story is this, Aladdin a poor street urchin who is tricked into getting a magic lamp for Jafar. Jafar is a royal vizer for the simple sultan who dosn't realize he too is being duped by Jafar. After Aladdin discovers he has the lamp he rubs it and POOF, all the classic Disney magic explodes on screen! Aladdin then has to learn that he has to be himself and not pretend to be others. Starring Robin Williems as the great humorous Genie, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you will love the music. OH! Let me tell you about the music, if you can you must must MUST get the soundtrack! It maybe hard to find but it is so worth it! The music is simply great. My personal favorite is ""Prince Ali"". I give thins movie a 9 outta 10."
"This is my favorite movie of all time. I have loved this movie since I saw it when it came out in 1992. I have watched it so many times, that I know all the words. I think this movie is great to watch with the kids. Or even if you don't have kids. I own all three on DVD and VHS. It is the first movie my daughter saw. I think it is the best Disney movie ever made. I like all three, but the first is still my favorite one. it's the original that sticks with you. the others may be good, but not as good as the first. I hope everyone can enjoy this movie. I think no matter how old you are, or no matter what you do, that there is always room for a good Disney movie."
"Robin Williams is marvelous as the genie. Try to keep up! True, the film gets a little stereotypical and formulaic. But the energy and story will keep you entertained. The usual be yourself message at the end can be found just about anywhere, but I'm sure you won't mind.Half the fun of an animated film is trying to pick out all the actors' voices. Try and catch Williams, Scott Weinger, and Gilbert Gottfried.*** out of ****"
"Aladdin is a key piece to the comeback of Disney. Before Aladdin, Disney was still struggling after a long period of fail animated block-busters films. The biggest blow to the company, came in 1981's The Fox and the Hound when long-time animator Don Bluth left Disney, taking 11 Disney animators with him. Disney came back with 1989's Little Mermaid and 1991's Beauty and the Beast, but with the success of Aladdin, Disney spark the era known as the Disney Renaissance, that continue until the early 2000's. These film restore public and critical interest back into Disney. Aladdin was a very controversial choice for a kid's movie when it came out. Aladdin is based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. It's still unknown if Aladdin is not actually part or not part of the 1001 Arabian Nights stories. The tale of Aladdin was somewhat violence and had various forms of erotica. The original story had Aladdin, with the help of his magical ring full of Djin, kidnapped Jasmine on her honeymoon. How romantic, a kidnapping movie! Glad, they change the plot somewhat from the original tale. One of the verses of the opening song ""Arabian Nights"" in the film had to be altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) due to its violence lyrics about cutting ears. There is also protest raise by another scene where Aladdin is mistaken by critics due to the line, 'Good Kitty, take off' which the critics thought he was saying 'Good teenagers, take off your clothes'. Because of the controversy, Disney replaced the phrase with ""Down, kitty"" on the DVD release. People have also took noticed with the similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams's film The Thief and the Cobbler AKA The Princess and the Cobbler (1993). Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s, so they have been dispute who rip off who even up to today. The film story is about Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weigner) a poor but kind-hearted Agrabah thief who finds himself arrested for thievery. Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) promise him a reward in return for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, a mysterious magical cave. Jafar tries to betray him for the lamp, and Aladdin find himself trapped in the collapsed cave. In the collapsed cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unexpectedly unleashing Genie (Voiced by Robin Williams), who reveals he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Seeing this as his way out, Aladdin created a new life as Prince Ali to get closer to the princess Jasmine (voice by Linda Larkin). Jafar starts to question Prince Ali believing him as the poor thief that he betrayed and start to make plans to steal the lamp once and for all. The movie has a great message for the children about being yourself and not allow yourself to be imprisoned. Glad they didn't go with the Greed is good message. The animation is great. Even today, I have to say when the Cave of Wonders, Sand Tiger come alive, it brings chills down my neck. The magic carpet ride through the cave was collapsing was intense. I can't help thinking of those scenes, even now. The music to the film is ground breaking good to hear. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is amazing. I love 'A Whole New World'. One of the best love songs of the 1990's. It has an amazing melody that complements the scenery very well. I too love how the song speeds up, giving it a very romantic yet magical and adventurous feel to it. The other songs like 'Friends like me', 'Street Rat', 'One Jump Ahead' and 'Prince Ali' also work. I do have to say the 2004, Special Edition released kinda ruin it, by having a new song ""Proud of Your Boy"", performed by Clay Aiken which I thought was mediocre. Now there has been a couple of fan theories that goes with this film, that I like to address like The Merchant is the Genie. Both look very similar, and it seems to make sense because Robin Williams voices both characters. Another variation of this same theory says the man made the whole story up to sell the lamp, so Aladdin wasn't really a true story. The last theory is the most outlandish. Some people think that Aladdin takes place in a Post- Apocalyptic future where technological marvels had been long forgotten and been taking as magic. Some critics even think the Magic Carpet is a time- traveling device. The Genie proves this theory by making impressions of ancient, long-dead celebrities like Groucho Marx, and Jack Nicholson. Still, it can make sense that the Genie is an all-powerful being who can see into the future, so he can make jokes like those, but why would he make jokes that Aladdin wouldn't get. The truth is, Robin Williams was making cultural references jokes to get more people to see the film. Much of Robin Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed and it was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters for animation to work on. It was no surprised that the film has so many in-jokes impersonality as Robin is known for that at the time. This was a new type of Disney humor that wasn't in much kids movies at the time. Disney would later use this type of humor in other animation films like 2001's Emperor New Groove, and 1997's Hercules. In an odd way, Aladdin also take place in the same period as Hercules, so a crossover was used in later projects. Check out, Disney's first direct-to-video sequel, 1994's The Return of Jafar and the TV Show. 1996's Aladdin and the King of Thieves was OK so check it. Overall: Aladdin is a great nostalgia movie that takes us back to when we were kids. Worth watching."
"Aladdin is without a doubt one of Disney's better movies. The animation is excellent. The characters are very realistic, surprising and rare for an animated movie. The songs are very good and memorable (favorite has to ""Friend Like Me""). Many pop culture references are here and even if you do not notice them, they are made very hilarious by Robin Williams. Williams provides the comic relief which is vital to the movie's success. This is one of the best Disney movies in the last decade, if not ever."
"Disney animation strikes pay dirt again with ""Aladdin"". Aladdin is an orphaned ""street rat"" who, with his cheeky monkey Abu takes what they need to survive the harsh reality of their situation. All with a song in his heart. But Aladdin gets mixed up in a nefarious plot by Jafar (and his hilariously funny foul-mouth parrot Iago) the adviser to the sultan. Like most of the cinematic madmen Jafar has hatched up a glorious scheme to bring the world to its knees but there is a catch. A person pf pure spirit is the only one who can grab a mystical lamp which is the heart of his plan. When things go wrong for Jafar (thanks to that quick monkey) Aladdin discovers the secret of the lamp and the comic hilarity that lay inside. Aladdin gets three wishes from the *ahem* Genie in the bottle (voiced by the perfectly cast Robin Williams) and Al's life will never be the same. Will Aladdin fulfill his deepest desires or will he rescue the princess and take a magic carpet ride into the sunset? ""Aladdin"" is a beautiful melding of computer generated and standard animation that paved the way for Disney's best feature (The Lion King). Wonderfully magical story with some seriously crazy comedians at work, ""Aladdin"" is great fun for the whole family."
"""Aladdin"" is brought to us by the same team who made ""The Little Mermaid."" So, of course, this movie leaves me a little baffled. There are some things I like and some things I don't.ANIMATION: The best thing about the animation is the color of the look of Arabia. I didn't see this movie until last December; before I saw it, I heard about how great the colors and the lights were. Everything pops, it's bright, and it's great.SONGS/MUSIC: Sadly, this was the last Disney film to have Howard Ashman's work in it; he passed away before ""Beauty and the Beast"" was completed. Fortunately, he left us some really good songs in this movie, along with Alan Menken and Tim Rice. Not every song in this film is memorable, but they almost are. Of course everyone knows and loves ""A Whole New World,"" which both does sound nice and contributes greatly to the movie; we really see our main characters fall in love. My favorite song is ""Friend Like Me."" Not only are the lyrics, music, and animation great, but Robin Williams gets just as animated as the animation.ROMANCE: I mentioned our main characters' romance a bit earlier, and, again, you believe they're in love. Though, have you noticed this is the same romance we had in ""The Little Mermaid?"" The protagonist sees their romantic interest and falls in love. They save their life and admires them, but the two of them are kept apart for some reason. Then our protagonist has to take on a new form/identity to get their romantic interest to fall in love with them, the villain eventually tests their relationship, but they wind up being together again in the end...Huh. I don't see the downside in disliking their relationship, though. It still seems genuine. At least Aladdin has more time with Jasmine before he becomes a prince than Ariel did with Eric before she became human.CHARACTERS: Most of the characters are OK. Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Sultan are OK. Iago and the Magic Carpet are a little annoying, but they're not that bad. In my opinion, the Genie - again, voiced by Robin Williams - is the best character! When I was watching this last December I said to myself, ""This film is OK, but why was it a hit during the Disney Renaissance?"" Then the Genie came on the screen. He is the most entertaining thing in this movie! Robin Williams puts so much energy and passion in playing this role. I like that the Genie isn't just a funny, pop-culture referencing character; he actually has development to him. That makes him both likable and relatable. I don't like Abu, I think he's too annoying and too selfish. The character I can't figure out is the villain, Jafar. People have said he's one of the greatest Disney villains...Really? I'm glad you see that, but I don't. To me, he's not consistent. Based on what I saw of Jafar in the beginning of the movie, I didn't expect him to be the type who would dress as a crazy old man or have witty remarks with a parrot. That's not to say that Jafar can't be funny, but did you really think the guy we saw in the beginning of the movie would speak as he did throughout the movie? Not only that, but his power is weak! Did you notice the Sultan did not fall under Jafar's spell when he tried to hypnotize him before the ""Prince Ali"" number? Why? What made him come out the spell so easily? He did it TWICE! Jafar's victims can decide when they'll be hypnotize? And why is his evilness so obvious, yet so hidden from everyone else? Out of all the times he's hypnotized the Sultan, NO ONE NOTICED?! Aladdin realized something was wrong the first time he saw it happen - no one else in the palace ever saw it?!STORY: The story is OK, I guess. One thing bothered me, though: in the beginning, Jasmine tells the Sultan she doesn't want to be forced to be married, she wants to marry for love (Blah, blah, blah, we've heard it before). At the end of the movie when Aladdin and Jasmine come together, the Sultan decides to let them marry. ""Am I Sultan, or am I Sultan,"" he asks. ""From this day forth, the Princess will marry whomever she deems worthy."" WHY IN THE CRUD DIDN'T HE DO THAT BEFORE!??! He could have stopped this whole thing from happening...MUCH LIKE ARIEL IN ""The Little Mermaid!!!"" Gosh! What's up with the Clements/Musker team?CONCLUSION: I couldn't go into too much detail, but you get the gist of it. There are some things I really like, some things I'm indifferent to, and some things I don't like. Overall, I still like this movie, though. I surprisingly find myself attracted to how entertaining this movie is, even the weird Jafar moments. I like it, and hopefully you will too. BOOYIKA!"
"This one is another example of the Disney guys' ability of traducing even the darkest stories to the screen. Aladdin is originally one of those dark stories with complicated language and plot, but directors Clements and Musker look beyond the obstacle and, once again, produce a great animated movie for children and adults. This film is wonderful. From the beginning, when a mysterious merchant sings one of the greatest ""onde upon a time"" songs ever, passing from the romantic moment, you are so fascinated with colors, camera movements and great voices, you can't take you eyes off of the screen. Incredible characters, a strong villain, good songs and breath-taking soundtrack and scenes, it has everything a Disney classic needs to be great. And this great would not be so great if Robin Williams wasn't the genie. What a talented guy. Jonathan Freeman as Jafar is not far behind, he helps the making of the best Disney villain. The characters animation is soft and beautiful, uninterested, the way the directors like. No matter the climax concludes with a (kind of) inexpressive phrase, it's only a minimum detail, and minimum details is for Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale (Beauty and the Beast), who seem to only care about that. Clements and Musker are a lot of steps ahead because they are the ones who inherited Walt Disney's magic. Let's hope they stay active for a good time."
"Aladdin is a brilliant movie. Sure, it isn't as good as Beauty and the Beast, but I think it is definitely one of my favourite Disney movies. It is beautifully constructed, with some of the best animation sequences of recent times. The music score is just delightful. How can I ever forget the animated sequence to ""A Whole New World?"" Perfect. Jafar is one of Disney's finest villains, voiced with relish by Jonathan Freeman. Unfortunately, like Shere Kahn, he was another Disney villain that was ruined by a DTV sequel. Aladdin and Jasmine's romance is so believable, and while people have said they are bland, they do appeal to you soon enough. And for me Jasmine along with Esmeralda is one of the sexiest female Disney characters. I actually found it hard to tell what was computer animated, whereas there have been some movies that make a mess of that. I want to guess what is computer animated. The best aspect of this movie, is a hilarious performance from Robin Williams as the Genie If he hadn't ad-libbed so many of his lines, the script could have won an Oscar- that said his genie was a perfect match and fitted with the story very well. Some people say the movie starts off slow. But with the songs and animation, that really isn't an issue. The movie also spawned the best DTV sequel, the King of Thieves. 10/10. Bethany Cox"
"Aladdin the street urchin (voiced by Scott Weinger) finds a magical lamp that unleashes the power of the blue Genie (voiced by Robin Williams) who grants him three wishes. Unfortunately the evil Jafar plans on using the genie to his own will and wreaks havoc on Aladdin's newly-found life (he wishes to become a sultan in the hopes of earning the love of his life, Princess Jasmine).This is simply a wonderful story with bold animation and a truly terrific vocal performance by Robin Williams. It's the movie's adult humor -- such as the Ah-nuld and Woody Allen impersonations done by Williams -- that make it equally enjoyable for all ages. When this was released in 1992 I was fascinated and used to watch it all the time; now, as an adult, I still enjoy the film for many different reasons, while still managing to appreciate the utter joy of the story.Yes, it's a bit politically correct with Princess Jasmine's strong will against her father and the representation of certain ""careful stereotypes"" (Disney is careful not to come across as racist and in the process cast Americans to do the voices!) but I like it this way. Without Williams the film would be a total bore, to be honest. With him, it's one of the greatest films ever made, which is something I thought I'd never write.5/5"
"This movie is one of the better Disney animated films in recent years. Cute story, fun, light, entertaining and a catchy score to boot this is actually quite tolerable. 7/10"
"""Aladdin"" . . . not only the best movie in the exalted Renaissance period, but also -- along with ""The Jungle Book"" -- Disney's best musical. Seriously, this soundtrack is chock-full of earworms and none of them are filler.Everyone knows what this movie's best feature is (and I'll get to that in a second), but the level of quality in its animation is staggering. The color saturation is purely eye-candy, and it makes Agrabah a memorable Disney kingdom. Even the characters (some of the whitest Arabs ever put to film) have personality in their movements that you just don't expect.These assets by themselves make this a worthwhile movie, but it's Robin Williams who blasts it out of the park. His overstimulated execution leaves an indelible mark on this company's history, and the lion's share of laughs come directly from him. It's a gifted, delightful and energetic performance, and it's easy to lay the movie's vast appeal at his feet.But honestly, the whole thing is wildly entertaining."
"One of my favorite Disney Classics, I remember as a child this was the movie that made me truly love Robin Williams, his portrayal of the Genie was hilarious. The movie has a great message and I remember as a kid not really understanding it completely, but as an adult, I truly appreciate that I was being bombarded with messages like the one this one presents. Also, Jafar is an extremely intimidating antagonist and the character is done to perfection, especially the whole snake sequence...still gives me the creeps.Love this movie and will definitely watch it again."
Robin Williams as the genie steals the show.Wonderful animated characetrs fantastic music combine together and bring us Aladdin from 1001 nights.A MUST SEE!
"Maybe it's just because I have a serious case of ADHD, but I LOVE this movie. I love everything it has in it. I love the animation. I love Jafar's slimy personality. I love how annoying Gilbert Goddfried was as Iago. I love the chemistry between Princess Jasmine and Aladdin. I love how much personality Frank Welker brought to Abu with zero dialog. And I absolutely LOVE Robin Williams as the Genie. I think he's the best celebrity casting choice since they got Vincent Price to play Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective (great movie, by the way).The story isn't that original, but let's face it, no one watched Aladdin for the story. They watched it for all that stuff I mentioned. And even though they added a lot of pop cultural references to the Genie's dialog that are a bit dated, you really don't need to know what they're referencing to enjoy the character. The Rocky Balboa reference in ""Friend Like Me"" doesn't detract from the song, neither does Williams' impersonation of Jack Nicholson when he's trying to talk Aladdin into telling Jasmine the truth about himself. They're just there long enough so that if you get them, you will, and if you don't get them, you won't mind, because the Genie's just such an enjoyable character.Give this film a watch if you haven't already. It's easily one of the most entertaining Disney's ever done."
"Aladdin, a street urchin, accidentally meets Princess Jasmine, who is in the city undercover. They quickly grow to love each other (as happens in movies), but she can only marry a prince.Disney's second golden years were 1989-1992, which were unfortunately quite brief. Of course they had hits before that and after that, but for these few years every film was an instant classic. ""Aladdin"", with its excellent music and the inclusion of Robin Williams, just hit home so hard (and spawned multiple sequels and a television show).How do you critique a film that everyone loves? You simply do not. I guess if I was forced to say anything negative, it would be that Aladdin and Jasmine look a tad too similar and some think they are siblings separated at birth -- and that would not be right. When Aladdin tells a guard that Jasmine is his sister, it seems plausible!One thing about the film is how it has aged in a way that was unexpected. In 1992, terrorism was not what it is today (2016). Although the film is innocent and there is really nothing offensive about it, one wonders if Disney could have made a film about the Middle East with characters who praise Allah in today's climate."
"A great typical family-oriented Disney feature gets a lift by giving Robin Williams pretty much the run of the place as a genie with a) an attitude and b) a gift for improv. So you get all the expected heart-warming romantic stuff and exciting chases and surprising intrigues but with that soupçon of the unexpected and, deal with it, belly laughs to boot. At a stroke, it broke the mould for countless Disney / Pixar films to come which appealed as much to kids as to adults, by catering to the would-be adults in all the kids and of course the universal kids in all the adults. If I was being critical, perhaps the background-settings could have wowed me a bit more, especially with the fabulous source-material and the vocal characterisation of the evil Jafar a bit more strongly delineated bu I'm probably nit-picking. As someone whose first book was the ""Arabian Nights"" at age 5, and whose only experience of the Aladdin story since has been mostly in local pantomimes down the years, it was great to see Disney's modern but traditional take on the story. The songs are good too, skilfully worded and not over-populous. Interesting to conjecture about the fact that this Hollywood production from 1992 was made at the time of the U.S. involvement in the first Gulf War plus I like the way it, if gently, challenges the notion of female roles in Arabian society, sadly still a topical subject almost 20 years on. Very funny, mildly subversive entertainment you can take your kids to - now that is a rarity in modern cinema."
It is probably one of the best Disney movies I've seen. Aladdin is one of my favorite movies of all time actually. I can relate a little to Aladdin in that I've liked guys that have been out of reach and just wished to be someone Im not just to be with them. It has teaches you that you don't have to be someone or something that you are not to have others like you. I love Genie though the most. That might also be cause I'm a huge Robin Williams fan. The characters are awesome and developed well by the creators of each one. I will say though and as retarded as this may sound. When I was younger I had a crush on Aladdin. I know he's a cartoon but I was a little girl. I didn't care. The movie is cute and funny and an over great film that the whole family will enjoy. It is a movie for everyone all ages and size.
"This, to my mind, is a terrific concoction. It has no story to speak of. Oh, there's some motion and noise but they are only there to give us something to look at while the three main notions, all of which are magically competent.There are the songs. Disney can do this extremely well. At least they can recognize strong talent, manage and exploit it well. These songs by themselves carry the whole thing. This is not a cinematic experience, it is a musical one. You could enjoy this as well and perhaps even better by just listening.The second component is Robin Williams. There seem to be parallel contradictory histories about whether he was extemporizing or not. It hardly matters. He has narrative energy that at the time was unmatched. It's faded now.And the third thing? Well, this third thing has increased tremendously since 9-11. I saw this with ""Man on Wire.""Disney is the absolute expert at character design, so long as the characters are women. For some reason, male characters are not as rich and mineable. This project was the result of them building a map of female characteristics and structuring projects around them. Why this is so novel is that it is likely the last American film to have an Arab beauty in my lifetime. Now that Arabs are politically demonized by the bushies, it becomes impossible to treat these women as human and therefore appealing.Here we have a snapshot from the era before that became impossible. Of course, at the time it was essentially and insulting stereotype: exotic, superflat belly dancer tummy and ""orientally"" kinetic real end. There actually was at the time a Disney real end specialist. I met her.Now this is translated into forbidden fantasyland.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"`Aladdin' caused a few ripples of shock in animation circles.  It seemed that Disney had started to pick up some tricks from Warner Brothers, like the rapid-fire topical references and Hollywood-star-of-the-day caricature. Most people were pleased.  It's orthodoxy in animation circles that the Warner Brothers style is a great one, much more lively than Disney's.I beg to differ.  Warner Brothers cartoons are under-characterised, talky, brash WITHOUT being energetic, and they don't age well.  They fail to be comic despite the fact that every other virtue is sacrificed for comedy's sake.  I wish it to be said that none of this applies to the very fine efforts of Chuck Jones.  SOME of his cartoons are masterpieces.  But some - the Pepe Le Pew series, for example - are dreadful; and what has happened here, I think, is that he has been poisoned by the Warner Brothers style. So too has `Aladdin' been poisoned.  In another decade everyone will have forgotten why Robin Williams was meant to be so funny and we will watch the genie only for Eric Goldberg's animation - which is technically superb, but a bit too literal, and too willing to follow Williams's lead.There are a couple of other flaws in `Aladdin' that will become more obvious as the years roll.  For one thing, the computer generated images just don't fit the other images.  (The Cave of Wonders is a visual debacle, which is sad, considering how good the rest of the art direction is.)  More importantly, Aladdin isn't an appealing hero.  Get this for shallow: he refuses to free the genie from servitude in order to perpetuate a deceit practised on Jasmine because of a crisis of confidence that, so far as one can tell from the opening song, he doesn't really feel.Of course we all know the film was a huge success, and it's not hard to see why: it offered the best character animation in the world, expertly staged songs, an uncynical look at an old story - all of the usual things, with a luscious princess thrown in.  Like ALL of Disney's recent animated films it's easy to enjoy.  But consider the other two of these films worked on by the team of Musker and Clements: `The Little Mermaid' and `Hercules'. `Aladdin', as much fun as it is, clearly lacks the heart of the former and the energy and technical brilliance of the latter, without offering a value-for-money trade off.  But don't let this stop you watching it."
"If you have any tolerance at all for these animated Disney musicals, this one is sure to be a hit. The plot is good, develops throughout, and manages to be accessible to kids, whilst not talking down to adults. The humor has moments for both groups, as well, entertaining those with two digits in their age with pop culture references and clever comedy. The characters are well-done, interesting and credible. The voice-work is quite good. None of the actors really do badly. Jafar comes across as smart and menacing. Gilbert Gottfried portrays his part well, and his voice works rather well for Iago. Robin Williams... he's great. Some of the best material in the film is his, and he delivers it impeccably. Beyond reproach. Unless you can't stand him and his act, he's sure to get you laughing. The songs are good, well-performed, meaningful and more often than not, catchy. The pacing is spot-on, throughout. The color scheme is full and the animation, with its mix of 2D and 3D, is a pure joy to behold. The energy, creativity and, yes, even emotion, is impressive. The DVD offers, among other things, two commentary tracks(one for directors/producers and one for animators), and a pop-up trivia track, all of which are worth watching for those interested in such things. I recommend this to any fan of the actors and/or Disney animated features. 8/10"
"It starts out as the usual raucous and routine Disney animated feature but over thirty minutes in a blue genie appears and as if by magic the film already very good is transformed into something special. Robin Williams and his manic vocal interaction with the cartoonery is sure fine looking, and still crazy after all these years: imho it was his best film.The old story of a poor street urchin who falls in love with a rich Princess, attains a magic lamp and the genie within who grants him three wishes; the rest is mythology. There are some nice atmospheric scenes and songs, with the plot holding up well with the sight and sound gags at many times running at the rate of one a second. So Pay Attention! The characterisations of Jafar and the Sultan from The Thief Of Bagdad are perfect, while Gilbert Gottfried also has a tour de force performance as the voice for Iago the brash parrot. There's the occasional dark moment which may scare the very young and me but it all adds up to a wonderful family film for children of all ages from 2 to 102. And you don't even have to wonder what it would've been like without Williams' incessant madness – if you're up to it just settle down and watch the sequel The Return Of Jafar as I did the once; I think the rest of the gang were there anyway!"
"There was a period during the early 90's where it appeared that Disney could do no wrong. Many of Disney's modern classics such as The Lion King and Beauty And The Beast were released during this period, and Aladdin can stand proudly alongside those two masterpieces. The main reason for this is Robin Williams' outstanding turn as the genie, which must surely rank as one of the best voice-over performances ever. Williams' genie steals every single scene he is in, thanks to the boundless energy and enthusiasm he brings, and he is big reason why adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. Apparently, Williams improvised a huge amount of the material and it is obvious from the moment Aladdin meets the big blue guy that we are in for something special. The nature of the character allows Williams to play around with impersonations, voices and in one or two scenes, some real emotional depth as well. He is undoubtedly the star of the show but that's not to say that the genie is the only good thing about Aladdin; the animation is fantastic, with one scene in which Aladdin must escape from a crumbling cave on his magic carpet being a particular highlight. We also have, in Jafar, one of Disney's most despicable and diabolical villains and many of the songs will have you tapping your feet and humming along. Like most of Disney's animated fare, the story is pretty straightforward and involves Aladdin trying to rescue his beloved Princess Jasmine from the evil clutches of Jafar, with the genie being his ace in the hole. It serves its purpose and manages to throw a few surprises in along the way, but the main attraction here is the genie, and he does not disappoint.One of Disney's, and Williams', finest hours. Aladdin is a masterpiece of animation that you will enjoy again and again."
"This is a movie I have literally grown up with. It came out shortly before I was born and I have been watching it ever since I was old enough to know what a movie is. Emerging with the many other well-done Disney films of the 90's, ""Aladdin"" stands out as my personal favorite because it has literally everything I look for in a good Disney movie: a good story, a likable male lead, a beautiful and equally likable female lead, a hilarious comic relief character, a memorable and intimidating villain and, of course, numerous catchy songs. ""Aladdin"" has all of these. For those of you who, somehow, don't know the story, this movie centers around a young man named Aladdin. Aladdin is a homeless thief living in the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and is constantly ducking the guards. One day, he comes across the beautiful princess of Agrabah, Jasmine, who has fled the palace because she is tired of never having any freedom. The two meet and instantly begin to hit it off, but shortly after, Aladdin is captured by the town guard. Whilst in the dungeon, Aladdin is greeted by Jafar, the royal adviser and secretly an evil sorcerer. Jafar tricks Aladdin into going into the mystic Cave of Wonders to retrieve a magical lamp, but Aladdin's monkey friend, Abu, attempts to steal a giant ruby, causing the sentient cave to become angry and collapse. While trapped in the cave, Aladdin discovers that the lamp contains a magical genie that will grant him three wishes. Aladdin uses the wishes to try to win the princess's heart and prevent the evil Jafar from gaining ultimate power. What really can I say about this movie? It's just a blast to watch. The songs are all catchy and will get stuck in your head, the characters are all lovable and not at all annoying, the story is engaging and coherent, the action sequences work, and the Genie, played by the late Robin Williams, is absolutely hilarious! I'll be honest with you, I can't find any downside to this movie, to do so would require some major head-scratching and nitpicking. If you haven't seen ""Aladdin"" yet, you definitely should, it's one of Disney's best."
"Well, this movie is so fantastic with all the amazing cast of people that play the characters!!! I loved the movie because of the humor,wit, fun, adventure, magic, and romance in it. I loved this movie since I was little and it's a Disney Classic. You can't help but see the movie over and over again! It's irresistible! I adore Aladdin and Jasmine this is truly one of the best Disney films ever. If you get the DVD, you'll get bonus features of how they made the movie and the behind-the-scenes of some of the songs. The song,""A Whole New World"", is the highlight of this special film when Aladdin starts singing to Jasmine how he could take her to a whole new world as they ride the magic carpet at night throughout the land!!! Then they sing ""A Whole New World"" to each other as they journey through. It is truly my favorite song.The movie is truly a must-have for any Disney fan."
"In most cases, ""Aladdin"" would just be another Disney cartoon. But Robin Williams as the Genie gives it everything that it needs! Whether it's his monologue when Aladdin first releases him, his Jack Nicholson imitation, or anything else, you're in for something hilarious. Approximately as funny as the Genie are Aladdin's pet monkey Abu, and villain Jafar's parrot Iago. Abu basically exists to spout out a bunch of ""ack"" sounds that only Aladdin can understand, while Iago basically exists to make sarcastic remarks and get injured. With these three, who needs Aladdin's relationship with Jasmine?! Even the Sultan provides a chuckle now and then."
"When I was younger, I sometimes now I think this is probably one of the best Disney animated films ever made. It is the film showing the Arabian Nights story of the boy who found a magic lamp with a Genie that could grant him three wishes. Jafar is the villain trying to get the lamp for himself for terrible ideas to rule Agrabah. Aladdin uses his first wish to become a prince to marry the beautiful Princess Jasmine at the Palace. Unfortunately, when Jasmine does fall in love with Aladdin he discovers he could become the next Sultan, this means Aladdin will not be able to use his final wish to free Genie. Robin Williams (who won a Special Award at the Golden Globes for his vocal work) as the Genie is just pure genius, he does all the best impressions, e.g. Jack Nicholson. The family will love this film. Two sequels followed, The Return of Jafar and King of Thieves, and a TV series. It won the Oscars for Best Music and Best Song for ""A Whole New World"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Song for ""Friend Like Me"" (also nominated the Golden Globe) and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Alan Menken and Best Special Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Song for ""Prince Ali"". It was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"
"In Agrabah, a street thief named Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weigner) who falls in love with the beautiful Princess Jasmine but can't be with her because the law says that only a prince can marry her. He discovers inside of a mystical cave, a magic lamp with a powerful yet goofy Genie (voiced by Robin Williams) whom grants him three wishes makes him a prince and must try to defeat the evil Jafar.This film is the most spectacular movie of 1992, the highest grossing movie of that year and became an instant animated classic for the Disney company. The voice cast is just great especially Gilbert Godfried's Yago character, beautiful animation, humor, spectacular imagery and unforgettable songs by Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman but what also makes the movie a great one is Robin William's scene stealing Genie character whom happens to be the funniest character Disney has made.Perfection at it's finest here, this is highly recommended and a true must-see movie."
"Aladdin is upbeat, fun, funny and good entertainment.  And oddly enough, it's all due to Robin Williams.  He brings charm, humor and fun to a character that hasn't been seen in animation in a while.  The story is the tale of wonder- a street rat who wants to win the heart of a princess, so he finds a magic lamp with a genie (voiced amazingly by Williams) who grants him his wish, but consequences come around.  Great fun, especially for kids, who will learn knew characters thanks to Williams impressions. A"
"This movie was being hyped up the wazoo in all the newspapers in its day by critics all proclaiming that it deserved to do better than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Why they all thought that, I honestly had (and still have) no idea.I wanted to enjoy this movie. I really did. But when it came out in theatres, I found it only merely passable as ""Saturday morning cartoon"" entertainment and haven't been able to enjoy it since.After doing such huge leaps of art and faith which finally reached a powerful zenith with BEAST, which deserved to win Best Picture that year and was every bit as deserving of all its praise... what does The New Disney do next? An ""over the top"" cartoony film, a movie given over almost entirely to Robin Williams, and also... in all honesty... the beginning of the end.
I had at first thought that this movie would be a brief ""detour"" for the studio in terms of comedic and artistic style, but everything in this movie has been rehashed by Disney so many times in an attempt to copy its success to the point of on-the-nose-predictable formula that it's safe to say ALADDIN completely destroyed the Disney tradition of lyrically beautiful animated films from the mouse house for good. We would never get another BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ever again.Want to feel alone in the world? Try saying you are unimpressed with ALADDIN. Try saying you don't like its songs. Try saying you think its animation looks cheap and unappealing. Try pointing out that there's no point to the nararrator at the film's beginning if he's never brought back to wrap things up. And, the biggest offense of all, try saying that you were un-wowed by Robin Williams' performance here despite the fact that you had usually enjoyed his work up to this point.I didn't care for all of Genie's modern-day references in a story that I had loved dearly as a child. I didn't like the self-conscious humour of everything else in it, either. And I also didn't like the sloppy inconsistencies in the art direction regarding the character designs.Now to be fair, maybe my disappointment had to do with the fact that The Denver Post's reviewer actually gave away the entire dramatic climactic surprise of this movie with the phrase ""My favourite part is..."" (I later wrote in a complaint to him at the paper saying, ""Thanks a heap for giving away the whole surprise ending in one sentence""). That might have taken all the tension out of the finale and such for me. That may be, but, given my reaction to the rest of the movie as a whole, I doubt it.I'm sorry, don't mean to step on anyone's toes, but I honestly just don't care for it that much."
"This film tells the story of Aladdin, a vagabond who will use the Genie powers to win the heart of Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, who also ensure the script, it has voice actors as Scott Weinger, Robin Williams and Linda Larkin. With a soundtrack written by Alan Menken, it won two Oscars, for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.This film, visibly inspired by ""Arabian Nights"" and the Islamic ambiance, is one of the best Disney movies before they started opting for computerization. The script is excellent and is based on the classic impossible love of rich girl with the poor guy. Romantic and original, this film was, for many children, the first contact with a love story. It conveys an important moral maxim: love can overcome all barriers and bring people together.The characters are deeply interesting: Aladdin is the typical vagabond of humble origin, who knows survive on the streets but has a good heart. Jasmine is a stubborn princess, full of personality. Jafar, the villain, is the Sultan's minister and only thinks of taking power by the easiest possible way. Genie, the genie of the lamp, is a magical character who can do almost anything. Destined to spend eternity serving those who find him, only grants three wishes and is the largest comic element of the film.The work of designers is excellent, at the level of the best that Disney has ever done. Colorful, with soft but realistic lines, its visually appealing and pleasant. The voice actors did a great job but Robin Williams, who voiced the Genie, deserves a special positive highlight. The soundtrack fulfills her role with great brilliance and stands out over almost the entire film, with musical moments of great quality. One, perhaps the most famous, is ""Arabian Nights"", which comes early in the film. But the most acclaimed by the critic is the song ""A Whole New World"", sung by Aladdin and Jasmine, hoping to discover together the world around them."
"Jafar, Grand Vizier to the Sultan sends a con into the Cave of Wonders to retrieve the magic lamp. The guard demands a Diamond in the Rough and devours the man. Princess Jasmine is tired of palace life and the Sultan's constant attempt to find her a husband. She sneaks out into the market where good-natured thief Aladdin with his monkey Abu saves her from getting her hand chopped off. Jafar orders Aladdin's capture and then helps him escape to steal the lamp. Aladdin manages to survive and release the Genie (Robin Williams). He promises to grant Genie his freedom with his third wish.Robin Williams is utterly brilliant. His personality is so big that he outshines almost everybody except the villain. Jafar is a terrific villain in the vein of traditional Disney. Aladdin and Jasmine suffer from being overshadowed by the side characters. There are a couple of nice catchy tunes. This is generally a good animated movie with an outstanding voice performance."
"Disney has so many classics, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, but one of the greatest is Aladdin with flying carpets, magical Genies, giant talking sand monsters. Aladdin is beloved by me along with millions of others and it will be loved by many more with this new Diamond DVD. Aladdin has so many jokes that it makes you laugh, but also has quite a few dramatic scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with relationships sprouting into wonderful romance. And, it is all wrapped together in one fantastic adventure.The story begins when a Middle Eastern princess decides she had enough of being stuck in her palace and goes out into the city for once in her life. She goes to the market and gets in a little bit of trouble, thanks to a poor young man named Aladdin. Sadly, he is accused of kidnapping the princess. Now in jail, he and another man manage to escape to go find a massive treasure and most importantly - a Genie bottle. The Genie (our favorite Robin Williams) comes out and grants Aladdin three wishes - now Aladdin can decide what he wants to do.Aladdin is such a fantastic and entertaining film. The animation is just mind blowing. How good it is, considering that it was made over 20 years ago, how full of emotion the voice actors ate, it is quite different than many other famous Disney animations. With such a famous cast, it is truly a masterpiece. And, quite nostalgic to hear Robin Williams' so recognizable voice as this is one of his most iconic roles. It really shows how he entertained the world with laughter for so many years. The soundtrack in Aladdin is incredible. Each song is catchy and kind of gets stuck in your head (I will show you the woooorld!) and so many of them are now classic songs that people of different generations sing.This special Diamond edition of Aladdin comes with quite a few bonus features. In one of my favorites, conversations with the casts, I found out a lot of interesting facts such as Scott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, actually didn't know how to sing when he auditioned for it at the age of 15! There are also several deleted scenes, showing how different they originally planned the film and even a deleted song that was done by Jafar, (Jonathon Freeman)!My favorite scene is when Aladdin releases Genie for the first time and he quickly gets out of his small bottle (he is rather big). I love his first line, ""10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck!"" I love this scene because instead of ranting about something, he just does his first line as a pretty funny joke, which forever brought this lovable special character into our lives.Aladdin has something similar to the other Disney animated films in that they are meant for the whole family. So, I recommend it for ages 7 to 18. I wouldn't show it to kids younger than seven because there are a few dramatic scenes that might be frightening for then. It isn't exactly bright and fun throughout the whole film. I give it five out of five stars because this is truly a classic and I love every aspect of it, especially our wonderful Genie who we miss every day.Reviewed by Gerry O. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
"Differentiation between two lovers calls artists and storytellers internationally to express creativity in order to create something revolving around this topic. It's even happening in kids movies as Disney takes this story every American has heard of called ""Aladdin."" Aladdin is a young man in a Middle-Eastern or Moroccan environment who lives in poverty with his monkey Abu. The two steal in order to survive. Princess Jasmine gets tired of being forced to remain in the palace that overlooks the city, causing her to sneak out to the marketplace where she meets Aladdin and forms a friendship that may even be love. Under the orders of the evil Jafar, Aladdin is thrown in jail and becomes caught up in Jafar's plot to rule the land with the aid of a mysterious lamp. Legend has it that only a person who is a ""diamond in the rough"" can retrieve the lamp from the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin might fit that description, but that's not enough to marry the princess, who must by law marry a prince. The plot is pretty sophisticated for a kids film. Children need to understand that this film is about how no matter how much wealth, power or ability you have or don't have, you can still achieve many great things. It also shows how anybody can fall in love no matter how different the two are. What's kind of interesting about ""Aladdin is how controversial it is due to being ""offensive"" to Arab nations due to the dialogue in various songs and the production design of the film. In 1992 The United Sates was just getting off the Persian Gulf War, causing fear of the entire Middle East due to stereotypes and poor judgment. ""Aladdin"" made controversy for portraying the Arab world as dark and cruel but it also showed the beauty of the Arab world and taught us how there is nothing to fear. With all the fine storytelling, were stuck with obnoxious singing and voice overs that never end. Every song is irritating and don't want to end. The plot is also pretty continuous and a bit long for Disney. It feels a lot longer than it is. On top of everything, there are just to many better animated films out there that are handled and directed better than ""Aladdin' and serve a better function."
"Watched this Disney's optimal animation in its BluRay form, a stock-in-trade family crowd- pleaser which has been engineered with an impeccable technique and what's more impressive, it oozes an unceasing force of genuineness to edify both children and adults, no condescending doctrine nor feckless naivety, and Robin Williams' voice-performance as the Genie is a great bonus and plays a big part in the film's classic status among its genre. To enumerate Genie's potpourri of imitations alone could be cogent enough to showcase the finesse both for the animators and the voice cast, Robin Williams is deadly hilarious, the motormouthed omnipotent servant, massively steals the thunder from everyone else. But it is not a pejorative remark to other players, on the contrary, it has the most effervescent ensemble including a usually trite class-defying mutual attraction between a princess with a lower-status prince charming. Jafar and Iago pair is another hoot apart from Genie, laughters galore!The plot line entwines pretty much in Disney's safe pattern, a romantic encounter, an abrupt departure, a reunion under the pretense as a legitimate suitor, fighting the evil enemy and happy forever ending, while it really pushes Aladdin to the edge of the cliff since Jafar's invincibility seems to be unbreakable, and the eleventh hour turnover is nothing less than a satisfactory one. 2D animation surely has been largely outcast from the lucrative market, but one can never ascertain there will be a wave of coming back in some years ahead, like Black and White films, their unique aestheticism is the wellspring of their vitality, after watching ALADDIN, it perfectly suffices to originate great mojo of satisfaction for an adult first-time viewer, so the last rites seem to be unnecessary, but a niche market-planning should be conducted for the sake of the laborious craftsmanship. The film currently sits at No.2 at my top 10 film of 1992, and Williams earns him a fifth slot in the supporting actor race, the one and only voice-performance on my own Oscar list!"
Aladdin again highlights how good Disney can be when it combines all the elements that make their films great. This film has all the heart and humour that a Disney film should have with a great voice cast making the story come alive. There are jokes for all the family and the story can be enjoyed by everyone. The songs are mostly timeless and the film is as beloved today as it was when it was first released.Robin Williams as the genie steals the whole film and is as funny as Williams has been in any live action film past or present. His ability shines through and he elevates this film from being good to being great.
"In this Disney family animation, street thief Aladdin runs into the princess and falls in love with her, but she can only marry a prince.It has been some years since we have seen a classic 2D animation as we enter a stage in film where everything is about visual effects rather than the narrative, and thankfully we have these wonderful films to look back on with a good solid plot, which is funny, strong and consistent throughout, and which is proper entertainment for the whole family.With brilliant characters with their own issues on their shoulders does the film achieve depth and variety for viewers, such as Aladdin wishing for more, Jafar wishing for power and Jasmine wishing for love. And its through these goals does the film become inspirational and enjoyable, and the one character who breaks all the boundaries is the genie.Robin Williams (Good Will Hunting) is the only person who could have made the genie what he is with a simply outrageous performance as the blue hero, with great magic, catchphrases and sing a longs. Easily the funniest character in Disney history in my personal opinion, the Genie has great charisma in helping others with his own personal life a sweet and soft moment for the film.There have been numerous times when I have watched this film and not noticed something different and it somehow seems to get better with every watch.Though does run on a few clichés there is no question that it does so in a very sophisticated and sentimental way which makes it feel more real and believable.The situations used and the ideology of good vs evil make the plot intense and exciting throughout. The use of magic was a very powerful device and makes the story even more special and brilliant.The film also has a terrific Oscar winning music score, which includes the outstanding song ""A whole new world"" which is possibly one of the best used songs in animation history.With a magical tale, great characters and a beautiful music score, Aladdin is a fantastic family animation and one of Disney's best."
"As my most precious person is Arabian & looks like a twin of Princess Jasmine, I can only rate ""10"" this Disney. It's totally moving for me to see the one I care in a cartoon: Her appearance, hers colors, her free spirit are there, mixed altogether with splendid flavors from her roots; It is not often those days to see Middle-east as a fairy taleSo, my heart gives ""10"", but reason would be more harsh because this movie stenches Hollywood business:First, you got again, and again the never-ending Disney plot formula: little sidekick animals & the musical: Hey! Look at those ones: a screaming monkey & lousy parrot! And speaking of music, the songs sound more jazzy American than Arabic melodies.Then, you got big Mr. K who decides than a ""Tom Cruise"" clone is better than a nobody Aladdin: But for what? Dollars or teaching kids wisdom, bravery, etc Then, the Genie of this movie (pun intended!) is treated like garbage.But it is not the worst:I want now to put shame on Disney executives (again Mr K. ?) for their short memories: Their loyal & awards winning musician, Howard Asham, writes to death his final songs with this movie and there's no remembrances for him in the credits. AIDS is such a shameful disease? Well, shame on you, Disney: Hopefully, it was a great emotion to see his friends nearly crying about him, so my title says it all"
"In a far off city called Agrabah there lives a young thief named Aladdin who wants people to respect him for who he is. But when he meets the princess Jasmine, his life is turned upside down. Jasmine is tired of people telling her how to live her life, and her father the Sultan wants her to choose a bride by her birthday, which only gives her 3 more days. Jafar, the Royal Vizer to the Sultan, wants to overthrow the Sultan and rule over Agrabah himself. So, disguised as a beggar, he asks Aladdin to go into the Cave of Wonders and retrieve a magic lamp. Aladdin winds up with the lamp instead, and unleashes a magic Genie, who grants him 3 wishes. This gives Aladdin the chance to win Jasmine's heart. Jafar is angered, and tries to stop Aladdin. But, Aladdin wins, and marries Jasmine.When Disney struck gold with their excellent BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, they tackled the classic Arabian Nights story and wound up with another winner, which was a box office hit, and 2 Academy Awards (Best Score and Best Song for ""A Whole New World""). The voices are excellent, with Scott Weinger (TV's ""Full House"") as Aladdin, Robin Williams as the hilarious Genie, and Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's pet parrot (also hilarious). The backgrounds are well-rendered, and the songs by Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Tim Rice are some of the best songs in a Disney film ever. Followed by two direct-to-video sequels and a TV series. Recommended. 10/10."
"Very few things fail in this movie. The story is good, Robin Williams is outstanding, Pixar blew me away with the back drop, and the supporting cast Disney until after this movie was famous for rocked. Abu and carpet were predictably better written for than the main cast, and Gilbert was made to play Iago. The movies only downfall that I can think of was its love song - the typical Disneyesque cheese "" A Whole new World"". It takes a bottle of Drano and a toilet brush to get that song out of your head. A true animated classic to show your kids and grandkids. Too bad Disney thought 3 outstanding movies (Mermaid, Beauty and Beast, and Aladdin) were enough and started dealing out the slop it is known for today (at least until Pizar came along and stole the show)."
"This is a typical Disney treatment of an old story, contemporized for the 90's with dozens of pop references and sensibilities.The voice actors do a wonderful job creating believable characters with one exception. While Gilbert Gottfried as Iago may irritate some, at least he is in character as a schemer. On the other hand, Robin Williams as the Genie is like getting a filling at the dentist without Novocaine. His vaunted ""stream of consciousness"" improvisational skills never click (if they ever did), and it detracts from the period of the story.The songs are wonderful, and in this even Williams' showcases aren't too bad. Especially good is Lea Salonga as the singing voice of Princess Jasmine."
"Aladdin is one of the many Disney Classics. Like the others, Aladdin has songs, detailed animation, and a good versus evil setting. It is pretty predictable, and has a main character who usually falls in love with some pretty girl.One of Aladdins many strong points was the talented voice acting of Robin Williams. The ability to portray so many different and silly characters that the genie does is one of the best parts in the movie. It is similar to how Eddie Murphy got to play Mushu in Mulan.Something else remarkable about this film was the storyline. The storyline starts off with Jafar (the villain) trying to find the Magic Lamp which will give him three wishes. Jafar finds the Cave of Wonders, in which the lamp is hidden. However, the cave won't let just anybody in. The only person who can enter the cave is a ""street rat"" named Aladdin. Meanwhile, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread and running away from the guards. Of course, this means a song would be involved. So, while singing a-long with the guards, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread because he has no money. Another plot that is happening at this time, is Jasmine's story. Jasmine has to marry a prince, but doesn't seem to like any of the ones her father picked out for her. The three character's quests and stories later merge together to make the main storyline. However, in the storyline there is one small flaw. How come Aladdin is the only person who can enter the Cave of Wonders? That's what I have been wondering. Is it just to make a storyline?Anyways, ignoring that detail, I wanted to say that it seems like Aladdin has a little something for everyone. It has action for the little boys. Girls may like the romance. Little children will probably like the singing and the fact that it's a cartoon. Finally, dads will probably enjoy the fact that Robin Williams is doing the voice acting in this film. (My dad does anyways, and requested to put that in there.) See it.6.5/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."
Funny. Memorable animation. Robin Williams in top form. Stay away from the rehashed nostalgia-inspired live action horror show of 2019. The OG rings true.
"Finally got to watch this movie today and I'm thinking I should've watched this way earlier. The plot was amazing and kept me intrigued throughout with all the interesting plot twists and action. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I enjoyed most of the songs in the movie, and I didn't feel they were a distraction from the story like in some other animated movies. Overall, the movie is great and probably the best and most fun animated movie ever."
"When I was a child, during eid holidays Disney channel was added in my TV for three days and in that I got to see Aladdin cartoon. I don't remember any story or scenes but the only thing I remembered was that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Years later, when I was watching TV I was checking the info of coming programmes in a movie channel and I saw there was Aladdin so I thought to check it out that time though I never had any idea of the 1992 film. And when I started watching I got surprised to see those same cartoon characters I saw in my childhood. Looked like my childhood came back.
The biggest plus point of Aladdin is its mesmerizing and fascinating hand drawn animation which transports you to another world. The next plus point is its humor and light hearted treatment. All the characters shown in this film I love a lot. Charming Aladdin, stunning Jasmine, cute like a Teddy bear Abubu, cunning Jafar and his idiotic sidekick iago, greedy but lovable Abu, helpful magic carpet and the wholesome entertainer Genie(thanks to the super energetic Robin Williams). Last but not the least to mention is the songs which goes well with the narrative. I love all the songs especially Arabian nights, friend like me, Prince Ali and whole new world.
Aladdin is the best animation movie in the world, and the best Disney film. I don't why today's Disney films don't have the magic of Aladdin.
On the whole, Aladdin is a film which nobody will hate unless you don't have a kid inside you."
"ALADDIN is among the greatest Disney movies ever! It's not perfect like SNOW WHITE or THE LION KING but it's very close.Everything in this movie is perfect: the animation is so colorful and vibrant, almost all the songs are great and catchy (my personal favourites are A FRIEND LIKE ME and PRINCE ALI), the soundtrack is awesome. Jafar is among the best Disney villains ever, voiced with pure villainy by Jonathan Freeman, and his parrot sidekick Iago is a perfect scene-stealer. Aladdin and Jasmine are very likeable and believable, but the best performance in the movie is by Robin Williams as the Genie. He has the most hilarious and best lines in the movie, and it's a very endearing character.However, even though the movie is slow in the beginning, after the Genie appears the movie is very fast-paced. Not to be missed!"
"I only recite films that I want to talk about when you've seen a movie and your body just wants to talk to all the people you met in life about the movie. Normally I only talk about how much a movie annoyed me or disappointed me because unfortunately it is the only feeling I have felt in the last few years. This movie has turned everything upside down.
I was overwhelmed from the first second by the world of the colors of the music
Usually I skip the songs in Disney movies because you just do not need them to understand the movie here I wanted to hear the music and here you really miss something if you should skip the music. There is a song that I have not listened to either in the movie nor in any other way because I just do not want to hear now but I could listen to Robin Williams as the genius for days.
May the man rest in peace he was definitely a legend who left us something big, but even so, it is a unique film with a unique display of unique animation and unique everythingOne thing I can not get over today is that Aladdin might have had a wish or that some of Jafar's stuff is not cleared up but every time I see the movie I do not care because I just want to be kidnapped by this world because it feels so good and looks so good.Of course, many things have changed but this is a movie you have to change some things because the same things do not work in different media and of course the movie is more based on the indian rather than the arabic culture but this is a fairy tale and no docu anyone who can Coin takes anyway is too stupid to enjoy movies decently.Some of my story problems are changed and clarified in the play, but we're talking about the film here and rate the movie as a whole
How could you save the movie?
I think it's a pity that I did not grow up with this movie because just like Edgar Wright movies in this movie are so many things I like or want to see more often but better late than never at least I know now what I can show my children the first Movie that almost made me cry."
"This film is just one of the BEST looking Disney animation I have seen. The animation is just so fluid and alive. The visual backgrounds are amazing. The characters are all amazing and memerable. The songs are great, though not as catchy as The Little Mermaid. An overall grear achievement from disney."
"Aladdin, a small thief from Agrabah, happens to stumble upon a charming young woman in the marketplace with whom he seems to fall deeply in love. Fooled by an old man, Aladdin gets his hands on a magical lamp which contains a magical genie who can grant any three wishes to his master. Thus, he will have to use all the help he can get to win his beloved's heart, especially from his new blue friend.This classic Disney movie presents the life of a young man who struggles with poverty but is determined to do whatever it takes to improve his situation and ultimately be with the one he loves, although she seems out of his league. It's a magical story which presents the main protagonist's struggle, his way of making hard decisions and his fight with a new enemy gained along the way. It's ok for the most part, but unfortunately, it isn't spectacular either. It is rather predictable and although it has one or two twists up its sleeve, it isn't able to maintain a high standard throughout. It even tends to be superficial in some aspects, especially regarding solving the main problems, but as it is targeted towards kids, I guess it's ok as it is.Its characters are quite stereotypical (the good guy, the evil one, the princess and so on) but manage to provide a good time, especially through the genie which as far as I'm concerned, represents the core of the movie. He's the one which brings colour into the picture, who makes you laugh out loud many times and puts a smile on your face with every apparition. Robin Williams has done a truly impressive job voice acting this character, making it one of a kind. I should also mention Abu, Aladdin's trusty monkey which is always there when he needs assistance. It's also very charismatic and even cute, sending plenty of emotion towards the viewer.In terms of entertainment, the movie has plenty to offer. You get many action sequences in which Aladdin proves his abilities, you get a lot of musical moments which are always welcome and you even get plenty of jokes, especially with the genie around. The visual part is also a big plus, looking very good even today, judging by the fact that it has over twenty years and counting.To sum things up, it's a classic story which almost every kid knows, which brings plenty of good time with everything it does, even after seeing it multiple times, but if you ask me, it could have done a bit more in terms of story. Nevertheless, it's a very good animation which made a great impact when it first came so its merits will always be appreciated."
"My Rating : 8/10The movie that started my love for movies!The prince of thieves, his monkey, his carpet and his genie try to regain the love of Princess Jasmine and fight off the evil Jafar who is the second most badass villain (Scar from Lion King is #1) in the Disneyverse. This is my favourite Robin Williams role considering I hated him as an actor and most of his acting roles were just crap, but as a voice actor I liked him.Also, I think I speak for every male from my generation when I say that Jasmine was our first crush. She was exotic, rich and a princess! What wasn't to love?"
"Perfect cast, perfect pasing, one of the best disney princesses and just amazing."
"No question Robin Williams delivers in a trademark role here as the wise cracking, ad-libbing Blue Genie, but I also got a kick out of Gilbert Gottfried's voice work for Iago the Parrot. And that's saying something, because otherwise, in a take it or leave it situation with Gottfried, I'd always leave it. The story is classic Disney, colorful and song filled, with an interesting balance of villains and heroes. The back and forth with the magic lamp gets a little played out after a while, but I thought the ending had an ironic twist with Sorceror Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) wishing to be the most powerful genie in the world. In effect, he got double whammied by the law of unintended consequences and a severe lesson in 'be careful what you wish for'."
"This is the fourth animated classic Disney film I watched this month. I am currently tackling the Aladdin trilogy. And maybe even the Lion King trilogy if I am not too burnt out on classic Disney animation by then. Anyway, this is one of the mega hits from the 90s, the silver age of Disney animation.. if you ignore the 60's-80's filler films the studio pumped out. Anyway, the late Robin Williams steals the show and really puts this film over the top with his performance as the big blue lovable clown. Good stuff."
"Aladdin is about a young Middle Eastern homeless guy living on the dusty streets of Agrabah. Aladdin, the main character, owns a monkey named Abu. Early in the movie, he, by chance, ends up meeting the princess, Jasmine, who is in disguise because she wants to get out of the palace where she lives and experience life on the outside in the real world. She doesn't like it in the palace because it is confining and she is not able to make her own choices. For example, she must find a husband by her next birthday per the local law. While they are hanging out, Aladdin is arrested for stealing bread from earlier. He is taken to the dungeon. Her pleas to let him go fall on empty ears because the palace guards are under the orders of Jafar, an evil sorcerer who works for the King, Jasmine's father. They do not disclose to him or to her whether they are there specifically to arrest him. Later, while Aladdin is in shackles, Jafar sneaks into his cell disguised as an old peasant donning a gold tooth and hobbling around on a wooden cane that looks like a giant corkscrew. In exchange for Aladdin's assistance in finding treasure, this magic lamp, Jafar says that he will help Aladdin escape. He begrudgingly agrees. What else is he supposed to do?! Aladdin goes with the disguised Jafar to Cave of Wonders where, inside, he finds the lamp. Find out what Aladdin does with his 3 wishes and how he tries to win over the princess's heart."
"Overall: This movie is one of the best Disney movies and contains one of the greatest comedic performances every put to screen.Good:1. Robin Williams is genius in this movie and is one of the greatest comedic performances in any movie ever.2. The movie is hysterically funny, mainly because of the Genie.3. Abu, the Magic Carpet and the Sultan are side characters who are interesting and funny.4. Jaffar is a pretty decent villain even if he turns to some clichés5. The animation is great with a nice upbeat colour palette6. Solid voice acting7. Great music.Bad:1. Aladdin and Jasmine are boring and run of the mill Disney characters. They have no funny lines.2. Jaffar becomes a more clichéd villain towards the end and loses all credibility3. Robin Williams is by far the greatest part of this movie. Without him this movie would easily be a 3 or 4 /10. He makes the movie and it only stands on two feet because of him.8/10"
"This is part of the Disney winning streak of wonderful animated films. It is the familiar story of the young boy who finds a magic lamp that allows him to converse with a genie. What an amazing choice for the genie as Robin Williams struts his stuff. The genie is the star of this show, but a good villain is also thrown in there. As they battle Jaffar, Aladdin is forced to use all his resources to become what he was intended to be. He must somehow become worthy to marry the princess. He is seen as a poser because of his humble upbringing. He woos her with the song ""A Whole New World,"" which is an apt title for what he has to offer. The best animated features have an edge to them, and this is no exception. The animation is fabulous and the story is well conceived."
"This is one of the films that I have liked since I was a child. Recently, I watched the play ""Aladdin"" by Shiki Theatre Company. I like it so much. Aladdin is a poor but honest man. Jasmine is the princess of the country. There is the difference of rank between them, but Aladdin gets the magic lamp and his life changes. With Genie's help, he tries to be a man meets Princess Jasmine. It looks just like a story of love and magic, but I think the backgrounds that the main characters have are remarkable points. Aladdin, Jasmine and Genie are very different, but they have one thing in common. It is the desire for freedom. Aladdin wants to stop his poor life. Jasmine is tired of the castle life and hopes to see the wide world. Genie wants to be free and not to be follow his master anymore. They have the impossible desire, but I think this common point is the key of the story that makes them close and makes their impossible possible."
"My grandparents have had, for a very long time, the Classics VHS release on hand at their house alongside Snow White, The Jungle Book, and The Fox and the Hound, and when I was a toddler, I remember seeing each of them and having the most memories of watching Aladdin. Even today, I still laugh at the jokes (some of them are a little puerile, but they don't rely excessively on them, unlike The Emperor's New Groove, and plenty of them actually triggered me to chuckle), immerse myself in the songs and beautiful animation, and with all of that, I know I will eventually see it again. My one complaint would have to be that while the songs are among the best you will find in a 1992 movie, you may have to watch the film or clips of it constantly in order to make the songs memorable, because even though I last watched this before I even considered becoming an IMDb reviewer, I still couldn't remember some of the lyrics to top-notch songs like A Whole New World. That doesn't change the fact, though, that this movie is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates Disney, musicals, early 1990's films, or films set in the Middle East (I heard that Persia is the specific setting for this film, but I am not an analyst in that regard. I analyze like any typical IMDb critic.)"
"With Beauty and the Beast receiving a best picture Oscar nomination, Disney's appeal was at a high and they were eager to build on their acclaim. Aladdin was the perfect film for this and took a very different approach for the studio, but they didn't forget what had made the previous few films so successful. It took an old-fashioned, solidly set-up story and gave it a much more modern feel with broader humour. You'd think that this would clash, yet it works brilliantly and gives the film a unique edge. It's a fine balancing act and I'm not sure many other Disney films could have carried it off, but this is one where nearly everything tried works no matter how madcap it may be. The film focuses on street urchin Aladdin and the princess Jasmine, both being fed-up with their lives and wishing for something else. After a chance meeting with the princess, Aladdin is roped into finding a lamp for sorcerer Jafar only to keep it and unleash a Genie that gives him three wishes which he uses to try to win over Jasmine. At its core it's a story about two people wanting different things and connecting because of that, just with a lot of comedy and many obstacles put in their way. It's nothing complicated, yet it's a storyline that people can easily get behind and they want to see the arc that both people go through. The romance takes up most of it, but enough time is given to develop Jafar and even the Genie's own dilemma.Aladdin and Jasmine aren't the most interesting characters, but they are very likable and as a result always keep your interest. Aladdin is street smart and Jasmine is adventurous, but both are very warm and easy to like individuals. The Genie is what most people remember and he kind of is the star here. Most of that is down to Robin Williams, whose witty improvisations and mile-a-minute comedic stylings are just brilliant here. Genie is just such a fun character as a result, with a numerous jokes of all kinds and he makes pop culture references that are genuinely funny. The Sultan is enjoyably absent-minded, while the characters that don't talk like Aladdin's monkey Abu and the Magic Carpet do provide some funny moments.Another positive is the villain and Jafar is just fantastic. His menacing design looks great, he manages the difficult task of being sinister whilst also having subtle comedic moments and Jonathan Freeman's eloquently dark voice works to perfection. Not only that but his motivations make sense and his grudge towards Aladdin is set-up excellently. Gilbert Gottfried as his Parrott Iago also offers some good laughs. The animation is truly outstanding. I picture a lot of beautiful reds and golds when I think of this film, it is always very visually appealing and the landscape designs just look lovely. The animation on the Genie is very impressive just by how fast it is and a lot of the movements here flow well despite the rapid speed most of it goes at. It also lends itself to some very effective tense moments, I think the climax in general is superb.The music is very good. All the songs here have very catchy melodies and are memorable, from the serene 'A Whole New World' to the energetic 'Friend Like Me'. None of them get in the way of story and the work well with the animation. The romance impressed me as well because there was a believable bond between Aladdin and Jasmine, they do have chemistry and you do get drawn into their struggle. There are some clichés hanging over some areas, but I don't think they affect things too much. As said the comedy is very modern and filled with pop culture references. Some people might fine this distracting, but like I said I think it gives a different twist on the formula.On the whole I'm a big fan of Aladdin. The ways and means by which they tell this story are very out of the box, but I think that is a big part of its appeal. This is a fresh take on a story that could have been quite dull and as a result is does place it aside as something very different for the studio. As said I really liked the main characters, I thought Jafar was an excellent villain and Robin Williams is simply a whirlwind of comedy. The animation is as impressive as ever and I don't think there is a song here that isn't at least good. I'd have to say that this is easily one of Disney's most entertaining pieces."
"I went to Orlando in 1991 and I saw lots of drawing etc for this film. At this time I was 11 and not really into Disney films and thought it looked a bit crap. Many years later I watched this and was surprised at how good it was. Most Disney films have a standard format and let's be from, get a little silly, annoying and cheesy. Now while this has all of that the characters are excellent, the songs are brilliant and the whole film really is enjoyable. I would say this is probably my favourite Disney film and that's saying something. It's also funny and smart which I like. It might not make as much money as Frozen but I can tell you pound for pound it wipes the floor with modern Disney films."
