"Watching Fiddler On The Roof I couldn't help but think that way back when he was a student, Sholem Aleichem must have gotten a Russian translation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. It must have influenced him so that I can't believe it was a coincidence that when he created the story of Tevye the Milkman he had five daughters and he was just looking to get them off his hands just like Mr. Bennett was with his five.Of course the difference between Czarist Russia for Jews and being part of the landed gentry in early Victorian England is cultural light years. Still fathers, mothers, daughters and prospective sons-in-law are the same wherever you go.Filling some very big shoes in the lead was Topol who to this day is still appearing in stage productions of Fiddler On The Roof. But in 1971 people still remembered Zero Mostel on Broadway. Mostel was no longer in it, but Fiddler On The Roof was coming to the end of its then record run of 3242 performances. Topol had done the London production though so he was no novice in the part. Topol justified Norman Jewison's faith in him by garnering an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Leonard Frey who was Motel the tailor who was the only one from the original Broadway cast and not in the role he did on Broadway got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In fact I liked him best in the film, a Yiddish version of Willie Mossop, the worm that turned from another English source, Hobson's Choice.The cultural divide is the thing about Fiddler On The Roof that does separate it from a Victorian novel to a story of a perennially persecuted people. The thing that got me was the people's utter resignation to their fate come what may. Paul Michael Glaser, later Starsky on Starsky&Hutch, is the only one who's mad as hell and not taking it any more. For his pains he winds up in Siberia. Many have wondered why the Jews just marched off to the concentration camps two generations later. The answer in many ways is to be found in the characters Sholem Aleichem created from what he observed during his life. Norman Jewison as a director filled the screen with this stage production. Small wonder among the Oscars that Fiddler On The Roof did win was for cinematography. The film also won for sound and best adapted musical score. The original songs were done by the Broadway team of Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. Bock in writing the music had as keen an ear for the folk music of the culture as Richard Rodgers did in writing an Oriental score for The King And I.If the role of Yente the matchmaker, a name as well as an occupation in Jewish tradition, wasn't in the original play, they'd have to have invented something to get Molly Picon in the film. The movie going public might only know her from such mainstream films like Come Blow Your Horn, but this woman who started as a child entertaining newly arrived folks from places like Anatevka became the First Lady of the Yiddish Theater. It wouldn't have been right to do Sholem Aleichem on the big screen without her in the film in some way.Fiddler On The Roof is one of the best adapted Broadway musicals to the big screen ever done. And this review is dedicated to my late grandfather Isidore Kogan who came from Kamenets-Podolsk, a place just like Anatevka and settled here along with eight brothers and sisters in a watch repair business. I never knew Isidore, he died a week before I made my earthly debut, but he would have so loved Fiddler On The Roof."
"Epic in plot, setting and length, Fiddler on the Roof tells a surprisingly tight and focused story that has ""universal"" poignancy--in a nutshell, it's about trying to maintain strong cultural traditions and identity in the face of a continually changing world, partially fueled by the youth, that doesn't necessarily share the culture's values or self-assessment of worth.The plot is based on short stories written around the turn of the 20th Century by Sholom Aleichem, who was often called the ""Russian Mark Twain"". Aleichem wrote a number of works based on his character Tevye the Milkman, who has seven daughters (in the film, this was pared down to five). They live in the fictional Jewish shtetl (""village"", or ""little town or city"") of Anatevka in Tsarist Russia in the early 1900s. The stories are ""slice of life"" stuff. A lot of attention is paid to Tevye's daughters and their potential suitors. One of the prominent conflicts with tradition is a struggle with arranged marriages versus marriages for love, but of course, being set in pre-revolutionary Russia, there are also political changes brewing, some of which have a profound affect on Tevye's family and village.Aleichem's Tevye stories were first turned into a Broadway musical, which began its initial run in 1964 with Zero Mostel as Tevye. Producer and director Norman Jewison, who had had success with films like In the Heat of the Night (1967) and The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), and who was experienced as a producer and director for musical-oriented televisions shows, including ""Your Hit Parade"" (1950) and ""The Judy Garland Show"" (1960), was asked around early 1970 by United Artists to helm the Fiddler on the Roof film. To their surprise, Jewison wasn't Jewish. He got the gig anyway, and in August 1970, began an arduous shoot--much of it done in a small village in Yugoslavia that refused to cooperate when it came to weather (Jewison couldn't get the snow he wanted). He ended up getting a lot of pressure because the shoot went over time and over budget--this was one of the most expensive films of its time, which was an era of economic woes for Hollywood--but of course we know it paid off in the end.Zero Mostel was out as Tevye, and Israeli actor Chaim Topol, or just ""Topol"", was in, based largely on Jewison seeing him in the role of Tevye in the London stage production of Fiddler. Jewison had said that he was shooting for more realism in the film, as opposed to what he saw as a kind of campy humor in the Broadway production.In my eyes, Jewison ended up with a bit of both approaches in his finished film, but that's all for the better. Sequences like the opening ""Tradition"" montage are hilarious in their juxtaposition of a grand operatic attitude and the rhythmic coordination of cleaning fish, hanging slabs of meat, and so on. Yes, a lot of Fiddler is very realistic, but it's equally humorous and surrealistic most of the time.The realism is largely thanks to the authentic settings, the fabulous production and costume design, and of course, the superb performances. The humor is a factor of the above with that Mark Twain-ish aspect of Aleichem's stories and the fine script by Joseph Stine.The surrealism comes largely by way of the cinematography. Some of the visual sense is reminiscent of Marc Chagall's early work and his later, nostalgic depictions of his native Russia, and in fact, the image of the fiddler on the roof comes directly from a Chagall painting. Jewison saw the fiddler as a cross between a metaphor for the Jewish spirit (and this is explained in more detail via a few lines of dialogue in the film) and an actual physical manifestation of a spirit. However we interpret the fiddler, the shots of him and his presence in the film are certainly poetic. Jewison also gives us some fabulous, surreal, wide landscape shots, such as those of agricultural fields and the beautiful ""wasteland"" in which the train tracks are set. There are a few scenes set on the banks of a river, overlooked by a bridge, that are reminiscent of particular Van Gogh paintings. And as a more subtle bit of surrealism, Jewison had cinematographer Oswald Morris shoot much of the film though a woman's stocking--the mesh is very clearly visible in some exterior shots. Of course, there are also a couple more surrealistic touches in the plot, my favorite being the Tevye's Dream sequence, which features traditionalist Jewish zombies in an operatic attitude.A musical couldn't be a 10 without great music, and Fiddler on the Roof has it. The songs are a marvelous melding of traditional Russian folk melodies, with appropriate twinges of Orientalism and the expected Broadway sound, but maybe leaning a bit closer to a modern opera. From that description, you might think that the music would be a mess, but all of the songs are inventive and catchy. They are seamlessly melded with the drama, furthering the narrative as they should. The choreography is excellent and it is well shot by Jewison. And Isaac Stern's violin solos are outstanding, of course.Fiddler on the Roof takes an investment of time--it's three hours long, but it's well worth it. It offers great drama, great music, great humor and great tragedy in a beautiful package--you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sing, and you just might break a leg trying to dance."

Composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick captured the drama and conflict of the story from its incisive opening to, ultimately, the powerfully silent human circle at the very end... Their treatment of the music produced some outstanding hits like 'Tradition.' 'Tradition' is more than a simple musical number... The brilliance of this song is in its ability to introduce the impoverished village and its characters  from the figure of the funny fiddler to the pathos and witty humor of Tevye, to the creaky old rabbi, to the bright-eyed matchmaker, to the sharp-tongued Golde, to the indecisive tailor, to the audacious revolutionary, to the enthusiastic butcher, to the Constable who brings that terrible order  It is the solid center of the film..

"I love ""Fiddler on the Roof"" so much it's difficult for me to comment on it in a detached way.  I just think about it and I'm filled with emotion. (And I'm not the sentimental type!)  It honestly depicts what it means to be human.  It contains love, faith, family, friendship, humour, violence, hate, prejudice, change, vulnerability, joy, community, anger...everything.  This film is a tribute to the Jewish people, but you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy it.  It's so rich that everyone can identify with it, and learn from it.As for the music, all the songs fit in naturally and stand on their own as classics.  ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" ""If I Were A Rich Man"" - need I say more?  When Hodel sings ""Far From the Home I Love"" it's tissue time.  They're all so beautiful!  If you usually find it hard to take when characters in musicals suddenly burst into song, don't worry, in this film it's so seamless you can't imagine them communicating any other way. The music makes it easier for them to say things they normally wouldn't in conversation.The characters are so real and down-to-earth. They're strong, hard-working people, who have their priorities straight. I can't write about FOTR without mentioning Tevye - the centre of this whirling story, and a man who, like all of us, struggles with the pace with which his world is changing.  He clings to the past, yet accepts what the future may bring. I don't think there is another film out there that addresses how insecure we feel with change. But hey, that's life. ""To life, to life, la chayim!!"""
"The range and audacity of `Fiddler on the Roof' is stunning.  By comparison today's musicals are timid, quaking things, terrified of frightening their audiences away however much `social relevance' bravado they may assume. This old musical is older than it looks.  The film dates from 1971; the musical itself from 1963; but even then it was clear that it was the last of its kind, a delayed swan-song from the 1950s.  There's sentiment, but no promise of a happy ending; humour, but not a trace of postmodern knowingness; realism, but and a willingness to indulge in fantasy, too. Musicals can't really survive without fantasy, and `Fiddler', along with `West Side Story', may very well mark the limit of just how serious it is possible to get without losing it.  The songs are uniformly good.  I don't know if Bock's music was usually so fitting, or if he happened to strike gold just once - not that it matters.As for the film ... I only wish I'll get a chance to see it in a cinema, for the photography is beautiful - and it IS the photography that's doing it, since we're made to realise that neither the village nor its setting is picturesque in itself.  Norman Jewison has assembled a cast not one member of which jars and makes the most of it.  This film is quite long, and feels longer, but neither length nor apparent length is a liability."
"In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, Jews and Orthodox Christians live in the little village of Anatevka in the pre-revolutionary Russia of the Czars. Among the traditions of the Jewish community, the matchmaker arranges the match and the father approves it. The milkman Reb Tevye (Topol)is a poor man that has been married for twenty-five years with Golde (Norma Crane) and they have five daughters. When the local matchmaker Yente (Molly Picon) arranges the match between his older daughter Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris) and the old widow butcher Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), Tevye agrees with the wedding. However Tzeitel is in love with the poor tailor Motel Kazoil (Leonard Frey) and they ask permission to Tevye to get married that accepts to please his daughter. Then his second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) and the revolutionary student Perchik (Michael Glaser) decide to marry each other and Tevye is forced to accept. When Perchik is arrested by the Czar troops and sent to Siberia, Hodel decides to leave her family and homeland and travel to Siberia to be with her beloved Perchik.When his third daughter Chaveleh (Neva Small) decides to get married with the Christian Fyedka (Raymond Lovelock), Tevye does not accept and considers that Chava has died. Meanwhile the Czar troops evict the Jewish community from Anatevka.""Fiedler on the Roof"" is a wonderful musical for the whole family about Jewish tradition and the new world. The performances are top-notch and this film has been nominated and won several awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Music Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score and Best Sound. The songs are magnificent and my favorite is ""Sunrise Sunset"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLEBAQLZ3Q). The sequence when Tevye asks Golde whether she loves him or not is delightful. Despite the 181 minutes running time with Intermission, the viewer does not fell the time passing by in this marvelous film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Um Violinista no Telhado"" (""A Fiedler on the Roof"")"
"Let me say up front, I am not predisposed to enjoy a movie like this.  On the contrary, as a straight WASP, the last thing I want to watch is a broadway musical or a bunch of Jews 'kavetching' about how bad they have it. That is definitely NOT what this film is about.  Though the subject matter is Jewish, to say it is a Jewish film would grossly limit it's significance. It is about the human experience.  Any one who has felt pain and persecution will relate to it.  Therefore I say every human should love this film.  It has an indomitable optimism and remarkable pathos that causes the viewer to empathize with the characters, namely Reb Tevye, played by Topol in arguably one of the finest dramatic performances ever.  Considering the lack of success Topol has had with the rest of his career it would literally seem he was born to play this part. This film will most likely not be enjoyable for those looking for spoon fed, mindless entertainment or titillation, but for anyone who appreciates the beautiful things in life, it is high art. I recommend you set aside an undisturbed block of time, (use the can first, it's three hours long) when you are feeling relaxed, eat some good homemade soup and watch this masterpiece.  Perfect casting, cinematography, pacing, art direction, wardrobe and best of all, an exquisite soundtrack by the great, and very young, John Williams.  Listen to this movie on a powerful sound system and it will sweep you into each musical number.  Especially (my favorite) the bar room dance scene.  Fiddler on the Roof should be on every top 100 list that exists.   Like no other movie I can think of, 'Fiddler' reaches deep into the heart and begs one to look at what things in life are worth living for and dying for."
"""Fiddler On the Roof"" is the stage-to-screen adaptation of the famous musical.  It tells the story of Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman in the tiny Russian village of Anatevka.  This role is played by Topol, who played the character onstage in the London production of ""Fiddler.""  We see him as a man mired in traditions, but struggling between his devout faith and the changing times when three of his daughters feel the urge to marry.  The movie is beautifully shot, and tempers the story, which deals with the harsh realities of Jewish life in pre-Revolutionary Russia, with classic musical numbers sure to put a smile on your face.  Between its incarnations on the stage and on screen, ""Fiddler"" will be immortal."
"Although I'm not normally a great fan of musicals...people on the screen constantly bursting into song for no good reason generally irritate me...this one's a masterpiece. Story, theme, characters (especially the main one, Tevye), and of course, incomparable music.This musical is set in the Russian village of Anatevka during the early 1900's of the Tsarist regime. It tells the story of the village's Jewish inhabitants (Tevye's family, in particular), their traditions (and the disturbing trend toward departing from them), their hardships and persecutions, and most of all their optimism, camaraderie, humor, and especially faith in God through it all.Topol is magnificent as the main character, Tevye, the village milkman, who imparts to anyone who'll listen his pearls of wisdom from the Good Book and has conversations aloud (sometimes musical ones) with God, complaining good naturedly about his troubles and of course the importance of maintaining, yes... TRADITION. He's the father of five daughters and much of the story line revolves around the older three, who reject the old customs of the Matchmaker, Yente, and insist on choosing their own most unsuitable husbands... Tzeitel, who prefers the poor, shy, awkward but endearing tailor, Motel, to the much older, wealthy, ruddy faced butcher (Lazar Wolf) selected for her by her father; Hodel, who chooses a student activist, Perchik, even if it means exile in Siberia; and Chava, who defies her father by marrying a Gentile, Fyedka, in an Orthodox Christian Church. Teyve loves his daughters and always tries to see their choices from the alternate, optimistic side (""on the other hand""...), but some traditions are too difficult to see broken. The issue of Judaism notwithstanding, like all parents of faith even today, Tevye finds it much easier to deal with his son-in-law's economic or political unsuitability than with major religious differences.My personal favorite scenes are of Tzeitel's wedding...the magnificent cinematography, the beautiful candle lit procession, the solemnity of the sacred marriage vows under the Jewish canopy, the bride supposedly plain but absolutely radiant, the traditional breaking of the wine glass by the groom, all to the moving strains (tears fill my eyes even now) of the immortal ""Sunrise, Sunset"" which asks the timeless question of every parent at their offspring's wedding...where has the time gone? how did my child grow up so quickly?This film touchingly depicts the close knit village life (where everyone knows everyone else's business) but especially in relation to the threatening external forces, the pogroms of Pre Revolutionary Russia. Racial prejudice against these Jewish villagers is an ongoing theme, and nowhere is this more dramatically and touchingly revealed than at Tzeitel's wedding reception. I won't give away the details, but your emotional response will be outrage. It's a picture that's worth a thousand words. Lots of humor, too, especially in the interactions between Tevye and his devout, long-suffering wife, Golde. Now, this is a couple that knows the true meaning of love. For me, the funniest scene in this movie was the sewing machine, absolutely precious. Wonderful music of course throughout. The ""fiddler on the roof"" plays his hauntingly beautiful strains, especially effective during the moving, emotional ending. All the songs in this picture are catchy but, unlike most ditsy musicals, also have deep meaning. Everyone seeing this movie at the theatre left humming the incomparable, lively ""If I Were a Rich Man"". In fact, they're probably humming it still.If you haven't yet seen this musical...and you must be one of the few who haven't...then you absolutely MUST see it. Make sure your kids see it. It's just not acceptable to go through life without the benefit of Teyve's wisdom, and whether you can carry a tune or not, you'll be singing some of these songs in the shower for the rest of your life."
"I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. I am not especially a fan of musicals and there are very few that I like but this is one of those few. Fiddler on the Roof ran on Broadway from 1964 to 1972 and received a special Tony Award in 1972 for being the longest running musical in Braodway history. In addition it was nominated for nine Tony Awards for 1965 winning eight of them. The popularity of the plays Broadway run spawned Off Broadway performances worldwide from professional theater companies to high school productions. Joseph Stein wrote the screenplay for the filmed version adapted from his book which was based on stories by Sholom Aleichem. The wonderful music of Fiddler on the Roof is from the songwriting team of composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick. Director Norman Jewison had never done a musical before and was best known for the drama In the Heat of the Night and the comedies The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming and The Art of Love. He would direct another musical after Fiddler in Jesus Christ Superstar but would find more success in Moonstruck, A Soldier's Story and ..And Justice For All. Veterna Cinematographer Oswald Morris who was familiar with musicals having photographed Scrooge and Oliver was known for his cinematography in such films as Lolita, Mobey Dick, Goodbye Mr. Chips and The Guns of Navarone. the film Fiddler on the Roof was immediately embraced b the public and received critical acclaim and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Director and won three Oscars for Best Cinematography, Musical Score and Sound. the film's setting takes place in the Jewish village of Anatevka, Russia in the year 1905. I interviewed a 101 year old Jewish woman three years ago who was born in a small village outside of Minsk, Russia in 1902 and lived there until 1920. In asking her to describe her village she referred to this film and said it was exactly like what was depicted in the movie. I can't think of a better testament to the production of this film than having someone who lived in a similar village during the time it was set in to see her past in this film. At three hours this runs a little long and it's hard to capture a successful musical stage play on film but this comes as close as you can get. As a musical I would give this a 10 out of 10."
"A beautiful film, every scene perfect, and Topol is unbelievably amazing. How can something so perfect be created...I try, in my own craft, but to see something so faultless, so perfectly manifested...I am in awe of such talent and ability. The art direction, stunning, But really, Topol carries it. A man of faith with intelligence enough to accept change, compassion enough to love through difficult revelations/revolutions.Was a very significant film from my childhood, for some reason, for a nice Irish-catholic boy, but I remember it well, finding again in my fifties, with a better sense of history, aesthetics, morality, sentiment, religion, tradition, it touches me in a deeply emotional way"
"...""Fiddler on the Roof"" stars Topol as Tevye, a Jewish milk man (and father of five) living in a small town in the time before WWII.  The movie follows him over a long period of his life, mostly focusing on his three oldest daughters getting married, and Tevy's opposition towards their new husbands. Of course, it sounds a little depressing, but believe me, when you here the song ""If I Were A Rich Man"", you'll change your mind.Musicals tend to become boring about halfway through (or at the beginning if they're really bad) because of overly dramatic songs or over acting. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" doesn't fall into this category.  The songs please and warm your heart whenever they are sung, and the characters don't either overact or become boring.Topol is hilarious and dramatic as Tevye, the dancing and singing father who speaks to God (and the audience) out loud.  Topol narrates, sings, dances, and mingles joyfully with the other characters, never even coming close to slipping out of character.  Tevye will go down in my book as one of the most memorable protagonists...ever.The only thing going against ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is its monstrous running time.  Not because it gets boring, but because whenever you'd like to watch it, you have to make sure you have about four hours of spare time, 9/10."
"In pre-revolutionary Russia, a poor Jewish peasant (Topol) must contend with marrying off his three daughters while antisemitic sentiment threatens his home.Let me say this right of the bat: while this film may focus on a Jewish family and their struggle to enter the modern world (which may be good or bad), you certainly do not need to be Jewish to enjoy it. I always felt like this film (and ""Yentl"") were marketed towards the Jewish community, but it need not be. It is just a great story with excellent songs.I loved the singing, the dancing, the story, the humor, the characters... there was really nothing I disliked about it. I was a bit surprised the eldest daughter was not Barbra Streisand, because they look identical. But, oh well. And I am also a bit surprised that the director was not Jewish, especially with a name like Jewison... but hey, he did a marvelous job!"
"I know people have complained about the length of this movie. Yeah, it is long, three hours approximately, but there are so many things that compensate. Norman Jewison's direction is very good, and the film is stylishly filmed, with some nice cinematography and there are nice scenery and costumes. The choreography is great, energetic in parts and graceful in others. Next, the music is outstanding. The incidental music largely reminiscent of Russian folk music is a real treat, but the songs are outstanding. The beautiful ""Sunrise, Sunset"", the fun ""Tradition"", the idealistic ""Match Maker"" and the energetic ""If I Were A Rich Man"", all amazing. Also, Topol, what an absolutely brilliant performance. He put body and soul into Tevye, successfully mixing humour, wisdom and poignancy and the result is one of the most memorable performances in any musical to grace our screens. All the other performances are wonderful, I liked it all five daughters had distinct personalities, and Norma Crane is fantastic as the mother. The story is both tight and poignant, about a milkman of Jewish values, who wishes his five daughters to marry. In conclusion, wonderful and definitely memorable. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"*** SPOILERS ***This is a truly great movie that happens to be a musical.  As with any great movie, it is a product that geometrically multiplies the visions and talents of its Director (Norman Jewison) by combining and extracting the best of the talents of his cast together with his technical crew members. 
As a written play, Fiddler On The Roof, was based on a script that was a true labor of love attempting to extract the best pearls of wit and wisdom from the remarkably rich legacy of humorist-essayist-philosopher Sholom Alechem. The superb musical play was heavy on wit and magnificently composed and choreographed musical numbers capturing-to-a-tee Alechem's spirit and indomitable drollery.  It had steep roots in the Yiddish theater and a perfect musical-comedy farceur to capture that spirit in Zero Mostel.Four years after winning the Oscar for the magnificent ""In The Heat of The Night"", Norman Jewison, a Canadian Christian, had the gall (in many eyes) to attempt to extract still more from his movie.  Rather than embrace the play's Yiddish theater roots, Jewison's movie is more about using Alechem's anecdotes and the brilliant music to capture the essence of the Russian town that Anatevka was at the turn of the century, replete with its distinctly rich Eastern European roots.  In order to do this, he made the bold, albeit unpopular choice, of eschewing Mostel and his New York roots for 33-years-young Israeli actor Chaim Topol who was a smash in the role on London's West End.  This still-controversial choice turned many off and distracted from the movie itself.  This is a pity because I found Topol's performance astounding and at the core of what I personally consider the strongest and deepest movie musical ever made.At its core, the movie version of Fiddler On The Roof focuses on the story of Anatevka first, using the trials and tribulations of Teyve the milkman and his family saga as a mirror to capture what is happening to the town, and as one of the characters notes to Jewish villages like it all over Russia.  As such, this is the story of the unconquerable faith and basic dignity and humility of Job, extended not just to Teyve, not just to Anatevka, but to all the Russian Jews of that era who were forced to flee the homes they loved.  Jewison captures the core and the essential truths of that unconquerable faith coupled with the overwhelming dignity demonstrated by these survivors continuing to smile and persist in humble faith even as their oppressors try to kick their teeth in.To me, one of the most illustrative exchanges is when Motel (Teyve's eldest son-in-law) reflects, ""We always wait for the Messiah.  Wouldn't this be the perfect time for him to come?""  Sympathetically but bemusedly, the Rabbi replies, ""Of course we shall continue to wait for the Messiah.  We will just have to wait for him somewhere else!"" All at once, the drama, wit, irony, pathos, faith and essential spirit of Teyve's family and the village leave its indelible imprint on our brains.  Jewison not only captures genuinely and unforgettably all the emotions and essential truths of Anatevka and the 3,000-year legacy it embodies, but creates a vital new legacy as its now inseparable companion.  Yet, at the same time that the heartwrenching story of the oppression and exile of the Jews is evoked, and the indomitable spirit that keeps the culture and religion going is reinforced yet again, it is brought forth in a manner that allows non-Jews to share in the emotions and spirit as well.Since I've given such a long review to a movie and story of great length already and have barely touched upon its many specific gems, I'll endeavor to be brief.  Norma Crane, Rosalind Harris, Leonard Frey, Paul Mann, Louis Zorich (later of Brooklyn Bridge), the female actor playing Chava, the ""Greek Chorus of Jewish townspeople"" Zev Schooler, and Molly Picon (the last two being Jewison's concession to the plays Yiddish theater roots) are all outstanding and unforgettable in their roles. The score (yes three good songs were necessarily omitted -- how much longer than 3 hours would you like the movie to run?) is beautifully sung and played, with the instrumentals simply stunning.  The choreography on the Bottle Dance is a standout.  The art direction, sound editing, camera angles, stunning photography, contrasts, virtually every technical aspect of the movie I can name -- and I mean EVERY one -- is magnificently executed to augment Jewison's vision to perfection.[As nothing is 100% perfect, I'll pick two minor nits -- unlike others, I thought Glaser missed the essence of Perchik's scholarly radical by half-an-octave and I thought the beautiful and talented Michele Marsh did not look physically like she belonged in that family.  There I said it.  OK, big deal, they were still more than good enough.]   I generally loathe movies of more than two-and-one-half hours in length. Fiddler On The Roof and A Man For All Seasons are my two most notable exceptions.  If you enjoy movies made before 1980 at all, and have any sense of the essential spirit of mankind and what the human race is about, you owe it to yourself to see this extraordinary opus -- a true masterpiece that only adds to its relevance with the passage of time. 11/10."
"Much was made of director Norman Jewison's decision to cast Topol (instead of Broadway's Zero Mostel)as Tevye, but his performance is the single most important factor that makes this a great film. Topol's portrayal has an earthiness to it that makes the farmer/milkman feel authentic. When he pushes his awkward cart through the landscape, you can feel his exhaustion.Jewison also does a great job integrating the music into the action. Songs like ""Do You Love Me?"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" spring organically from the action. The film's themes are universal in nature. Even in his small village, Tevye cannot avoid a changing world. It challenges his beliefs and threatens his beloved traditions. Eventually, it changes every aspect of his life. Finally, he realizes that what his daughter says to him is true--home is where your love is.Virtually every aspect of this film is excellent, from the dancing to the cinematography. And the cast is wonderful."
"I have seen a lot of movies, and this is my favorite one. There is no movie that touched my heart so much. It is amazing in every way. It's amazing musical, amazing comedy, drama, etc. the movie starts with telling the importance of tradition in jewish community, and man who tells it has daughters that are in love and want to marry in non traditional way. That guy cant accept it but he cant ignore the happiness in the eye of his daughters. Wat is he going to do? Well to know that you have to see the movie. And believe me, jou will be glad that jou have seen this gem. I have seen this movie 7 jears ago, and it is still my favorite movie!!"
"Across the 1960s all the movie genres that had developed in the previous two decades underwent massive changes – the old biblical epics disappeared completely, the Westerns and gangster movies became almost unrecognisable. Then there was a new generation of musicals – avant-garde, burlesque-influenced, many of them brilliant but in a category of their own. And yet, musicals of the older format clung on for a surprisingly long time, rubbing shoulders with their more modern cousins. Fiddler on the Roof, adapted in 1971 from a 1964 stage show, is one of the last great classic musicals.Of course, Fiddler on the Roof is not as old-fashioned as all that. Although the Broadway musical was long dominated by writers of a Jewish background, the idea of doing a show using Hebrew melodies was only really thinkable in a more flexible era. And the score by musician Jeremy Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick just happens to be one of the finest musical scores ever written, with a canny and emotional union of melody and rhythm with words and meanings. For example, in the song ""Tradition"" there is a verse – each with its own different melody – for fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, respectfully. Then the father and daughter verses play together, creating a lovely harmony while emphasising that this is a story of father-daughter relationships. ""Matchmaker"" features some incredibly clever lyrics, moving from dreamy thoughts of ideal men and working round to a consideration of the realities of arranged marriage, with such poetry that combined with the sweet, flighty tune creates a sublime and poignant beauty. There is not a single weak song in the score, and the whole thing is perfectly structured, moving from the mighty ""Tradition"" to the delicate ""Matchmaker"", to the bombastic ""If I Were a Rich Man"" to the haunting ""Sabbath Prayer"" and so on.The director of this screen version is Norman Jewison, always a filmmaker of musical sensibilities. There is a lot of rhythmic editing in Fiddler on the Roof, perhaps a rather facile technique, but Jewison mixes it up with a lot of on-the-beat movement, a kind of choreography of everyday actions, often taking care to make each shot ""agree"" rhythmically with the one preceding it. In the scene where we are introduced to Golde and the daughters, almost every time there is a new speaker we get a cut, an angle change and a camera move. By making those techniques occur simultaneously Jewison lessens out the impact of each, getting that hurried, busy feeling without making it look over-edited or artificial. He's also very good at making the action slide gracefully into a song, such as the pan into a close-up that opens the song ""Matchmaker"". He doesn't need a massive shift in technical style when a song begins, so the whole thing flows very smoothly and naturally.At the heart of the movie is of course that gigantic performance from Chaim Topol. He has a brilliant dancing style, a kind of mix of big-armed gesture and a really unrestrained segueing into the song. He could probably not do anything really athletic or precise, but his feeling for the music is clear. During the talking scenes, he's brilliant at bringing himself down to a level of serious contemplation, then suddenly bursting it with a comically angered outburst. Norma Crane manages to match him in presence, and yet with a more natural, sober turn. And Leonard Frey plays the stereotypical gangly youth, believably bringing out some forcefulness during his confrontation with Topol. Those familiar with English sitcoms can look out for before-they-were-famous appearances from Ruth ""Hi-de-hi campers"" Madoc hamming it up magnificently as the spectral Fruma Sarah, and Roger Lloyd ""Trigger"" Pack in a bit part as the sexton.The music and the people bring to life a story that is wonderfully touching and ultimately rather bleak, as many later musicals often could be. And this is where Fiddler on the Roof really seems to span the trends of the old and the new. The triumph of love has of course long been the preoccupation of the musical, but the triumph of love over tradition does chime in very well with the spirit of the age in which this picture and its stage predecessor were produced. But aside from this context, Fiddler on the Roof's warm humanity, larger-than-life characters and beautiful music make it one of the genre's greats, a movie that can be enjoyed today and by generations to come."
"Solomon/Sholom Rabinowitz was probably the greatest Eastern European Jewish writer (his closest competitor is Issac Peretz). In the late 19th Century, writing as ""Sholem Aleichem"", he wrote a huge amount of short stories, novels, and plays. When he supposedly met Mark Twain at the start of the 20th Century, Twain said he was told he was the American ""Sholem Aleichem"". Most people who know of him recall his invention of the character of the philosophical and wry witted dairyman Tevye. Tevye, in his village of Anatevka, is struggling to make a living and raise his seven (not five) daughters with his wife Golde. The short stories not only deal with his philosophical point of view of how God and man (in particular the Jews) coexist, but also how to get the girls married without the financial muscle to give them dowries that are expected.Joseph Stein's play for the Broadway musical this film is based on reduces the number of the daughters to five. Actually only the stories of the first three daughters Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris), Hodel (Michele Marsh), and Chava (Neva Small), are given in greater details - because the other two remaining daughters have stories that don't quite fit in with the film's conclusion. Shprinze (Elaine Edwards) drowns herself when jilted. Bielke (Candy Bonstein) does marry a millionaire war profiteer (the stories went up to the Russo - Japanese War), and Tevye has a brief period of prosperity (though he loathes the son-in-law as a bullying ignoramus) before the son-in-law's fortune collapses. In the movie the two girls end up heading for America with their parents.But Stein's play manages to get the spirit of Aleichem's stories across, so that the changes I mentioned are not too important. Tevye (Topol) can't understand why he is made to struggle daily and never get's a chance for some prosperity. ""You have made so many poor people."", Tevye says to God. ""I realize it is not a crime to be poor...but it's no great honor either!"" There is a chance for Tevye when the local butcher, Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann) reveals he wants to marry Tzeitel. Tevye agrees to the offer of Lazar through the marriage broker Yente (Molly Picon), much to the happiness of his wife Golde (Norma Crane). But Tevye learns that Tzeitel is in love with the village tailor Motel Kamzoil (Leonard Frey). How Tevye gets out of the marriage contract is straight from the original story - it shows how useful the supernatural can sometimes be.Subsequently Tevye faces the love affair of his second daughter Hodel with the young revolutionary Perchek (Paul Michael Glaser), who ends up getting sent to Siberia (whither Hodel follows him). And then comes the third daughter, Chava, who falls for Fyedka (Ray Lovelock), which ends in a peculiar tragedy for Tevye - Fyedka is Christian, and when they marry it is in a Russo Orthodox ceremony. Tevye's love for his faith and tradition - the backbone of Jewish existence that Tevye insists on - causes him to renounce his living third daughter as dead to the family.The collapsing days of the old Romanov Empire are illustrated, showing the use of official anti-Semitism as a manner of controlling the situation (it really didn't help much). As the viciousness of the old regime towards Jews ends the film with the forced removal of Tevye and his people from their lands. And the only thing to do is head for America or Poland or Israel - any place but Russia.The play/musical's numbers are well done, as are the violin solos played by Isaac Stern. Topol was a fine Tevye - although one misses seeing Zero Mostel's great performance there are some television sequences of Zero singing ""If I were a rich man"" that give us an idea of what he was like in the role. Topol emphasizes the even tempered, realist who is Tevye, who has a heart, sorely injured at times. He is abetted by his wife, a role well played by Crane. Molly Picon has a good time as that yente Yente, who is constantly trying to make a living making arranged marriages. Leonard Frey is fine as Motel, singing ""Wonder of Wonders"". Also note Louis Zorich as the local police constable, who has a ""decent"" relationship with Tevye, but who finds it collapse when ordered to force the Jews from the village (Topol puts him in his place quite well here). This film was a brilliant example of how to film a musical classic, and make a classic movie musical at the same time."
"Strong film adaptation of one of the greatest musicals ever. Jewison beautifully recaptures the essence of the Alchiem stories with wonderful cinematography, editing and performances from Teyve, Frey and Molly Picon. One of the last great movie musicals."
"Based on the Broadway musical, the story takes place in a small Jewish community in a rural area of Tsarist Russia. Tevye (Chaim Topol) is a poor milkman with five daughters, three of whom are reaching adulthood. He has difficulty with the more modern attitudes of his daughters while the community faces danger from the lingering anti-Semitism from outside.Director Norman Jewison has done a superb job with this beautiful film which is exquisitely photographed by Oswald Morris. The camera movements as well as the framing of each scene perfectly add to the emotions generated by the story and, of course, those great songs by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. Jewison also shows great skill with crowd scenes.The first half of this three-hour film has musical numbers that are boisterous and breathtaking. The best include ""Tradition"" (with a superb montage that reflect the community's working and religious life); the title song, played by the title character, during the opening credits (with a sunset background to die for); ""Matchmaker"" (amusing and well choreographed); ""If I Were a Rich Man"" (where Tevye gets uncharacteristically lively); ""To Life"" (brilliant dancing); and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" mixed with a vigorous and lively wedding scene.In the second half, the mood changes significantly with the story. The joy and humour (or at least as much joy as one can find while being poor), turns to sadness and melancholy. The song ""Anatevka"" enhances this dour mood as the preceding songs enhanced the happier times. The final sequence might seem prolonged but it brilliantly makes the heart cry with admiration for those who can still move ahead with resilience. The level of detail is very effective. Thankfully, the film ends with a medley of songs to alleviate the viewers' drained hearts.The performances are mixed but mostly good. Topol stands out in the main role. His eyes alone convey so much emotion. And his occasional conversations with God are delightful. He is convincing in his portrayal of someone who is almost resigned to his situation but can also release an outburst now and then.On social issues, ""Fiddler"" is rightly renowned for exposing part of the history of anti-Semitism. But it can also be credited for exposing the daily grinds of the working poor. And of course, the songs, the colours etc.....!!!!!!!!!OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Norman Jewison"
"I LOVE this musical but I weep a little always for the Yiddish culture lost forever. The world is so much poorer. I apologise for straying from the artistic merit to linger on the loss to HumanityNevertheless this film is a permanent record of the fact that we enjoyed a wondrous Yiddish culture in our midst in Europe but after a series of Pogroms culminating in the Holocaust the heart was ripped out of our culture here in EuropeThe music, the humour, the humanity, gone forever from the Heart of Europa. Europe's lossIrish Gentile"
"Fiddler on the roof is that type of movie that brings you a sentiment of content and fulfillment given by the amount of knowledge accumulated at it's final. A movie full of color, art, beauty, naturalness through images and music, acting and screenplay. What makes you reflect a while after seeing this movie is the richness of messages that it transmits. In my opinion, the movie expresses that rules are not always beneficial and that curiosity is good because it allows changing and evolution. More, the movie emphasizes the importance of tradition in the expression of people's devotion towards God.One thing we can learn is that love doesn't take rules into account. And more, it doesn't matter you're poor, it is not wealth that makes us happy. What is the most important thing in our pursuit of happiness is love.The best musical movie I have ever seen."
"The story took place in the village of Russia, 1904. It centered around the leading role, Tevya, who was diaryman. Tevya was a enlightened old man, he had open-minded thought and he deeply loved his three daughters. When he looked into the future of the daughters who were unmarried, he always sang the song ""If I am the rich"" very kindly, because he fervently expected that they got a bright future.In the beginning, Tevya was trying to marry off Tzietel, the oldest daughter. The matchmaker found her a matcher in Lazar Wolfm the butcher. However, the butcher was much older than Tzietel, and she didn't love him. she loved a poor tailor, and they promised to each other that they would get married. At last Tevya said yes to them. Meanwhile the second child Hodel, and a poor student also fell in love soon, and they got engaged. They informed her father this and he gave them permission to be married. The poor student was arrested for demonstrating, and was sent to a distant prison, Hodel left to join there. Last, the last daughter , Chava and Fyedka fell in love. Chava told Tevya, and he was outraged, because she wanted to marry out of the faith. She got married anyway, and Tevya disowned her. Soon after that, all of the Jewish people in Anatevka got a notice to move out. And that's the end of the play. Ir's a kind of sad ending."
"I found this to be a very touching, inspiring, heart felt movie. The songs are pure magic.
This movie touches all your emotions."
"Both life-affirming and heart-wrenching in equal measure. Wonderful set pieces and nuanced detail, humour and pathos, musical numbers and a soundtrack to die for. At whatever level you watch this film on it delivers. Possibly my favourite film of all time. Don't miss out."
"I love this movie; they do a good job integrating music with the action scenes. The music is very good in the movie. This movie is far from boring. It keeps you captivated. It is a good family movie about love., understanding, and acceptable; It is also about forgiveness and letting go. One can learn alot from this movie. The performances were great, especially the father, he is superb in this movie. Great cast and great film."
"I am not generally a fan of musicals that have been adapted to the screen, but ""Fiddler on the Roof"" remains as one of the notable exceptions, thanks largely to the genius of director Norman Jewison (""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Moonstruck"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair, ""Jesus Christ Superstar""), the endearing charm, vitality, and humanity of (Chaim) Topol, the ability of the rest of the cast to meet the elevated standard set by the lead, the innovative cinematography of Oswald Morris (""Lolita"", ""Oliver!"", ""The Entertainer"", ""Guns of Navarone"") and the wonderful music, originally written by Jerry Bock and so capably adapted to the screen by John Williams.As to the excellent cast, although there isn't one, single Hollywood ""superstar"" present, this remarkable team nevertheless succeeds in creating one of the best musicals ever adapted to film and a movie that still survives on my list of favorites after many viewings. Personally, I would have loved to see Bea Arthur reprise her Broadway role as Yenta, but that's show business. Jewison's pick of Topol over Zero Mostel, however, was another one of his strokes of brilliance. Although Topol was mostly unknown outside of his native Israel, Jewison made a bold decision to cast him as Tevye, and this was only one example of the director's daring, innovative thinking that enhanced his directing and producing endeavors. He also agreed to cast Norma Crane as the female lead, Golde, who compliments Topol perfectly, even though I don't recall ever seeing her in a film other than her small but critical part as an unkind waitress in ""Tea and Sympathy"" fifteen years earlier. Only Jewison had the ability to see her as ""the perfect match"" for Tevye. Right? Of course right!The story, based on the Yiddish short stories of Sholom Aleichem, is a familiar one for the Jewish people as they steadfastly struggled to hold to their traditions and values in the face of a rapidly changing environment that becomes increasingly hostile to their existence as both a religious and ethnic minority. As bad as conditions were for them during pre-revolutionary Russia and Ukraine, their situation would only worsen, especially when the Germans conquered much of Ukraine, where the story is set, only a few decades later during World War II.The fiddler in the play is a symbol of the perpetually precarious existence of Jews who have often depended upon the kindness of strangers throughout much of their history. Beyond the unique Jewish experience and regardless of our specific faith or ethnicity, the fiddler represents the universal fragility of our lives on this earth. Indeed, the uncertainties of life itself are like...they're like a fiddler on the roof!"
"Rarely a film so authentic. I saw several movies by Norman Jewison, Moonstruck(1987), ... and justice for all.(1979), F.I.S.T.(1978), Rollerball(1975), The Cincinnati Kid(1965), Bogus(1996), Other People's Money(1991), Only You(1994). I saw also two masterpieces by the same Norman Jewison: Jesus Christ Superstar(1973) and In the Heat of the Night(1967). Fiddler on the Roof(1971) it's his most successful and fulfilled film, in my opinion. The actors are downright amazing: Topol, Norma Crane, Leonard Frey, Molly Picon, Paul Mann, Rosalind Harris (exceptional), Michele Marsh, Neva Small. The music is very beautiful. There are many movies which lasts only 90 minutes, but you want to finish faster, they are so bad; Fiddler on the Roof it lasts 180 minutes, but you do not want to end."
"Anti-Semitism has been an issue of the world for millenniums, and as one character here describes the life of a Jew, ""Our fore-fathers have been kicked out of many places."" ""Maybe that's why we always wear our hats"", Topol's Tevye gently replies, a touch of irony hidden behind his wisecrack. Tevye is a poor man, but he is a man of the world who understands humanity, both Jewish and Gentile, and he has no issue of socializing on occasion with the Gentile Russians he is surrounded by. He longs to help keep the peace, and for good reason: He has eight daughters who must find good husbands, and a tough wife who keeps him in line. It's all about ""Tradition!"", though, and Tevye is having a difficult time in accepting the changing times, especially the independence his three oldest daughters throw his way as his ideals of traditional matchmaking are thrown out of the window.Wife Golde (Norma Crane) surprises him with the news that Yente the Matchmaker (Molly Picon) has come up with a match for their oldest daughter, Tzeitel. It's Lazar Wolfe, the widowed butcher, a man Tevye despises, but after downing a few shots thanks to the rich Lazar, Tevye is convinced that he'll be perfect for the namesake of Golde's beloved grandmother. What he doesn't count on is the fact that Tzeitel and the two daughters next in line all have their own ideas as to what makes a perfect match, and after the rousing ""To Life!"", Tevye learns the truth when he breaks the news to the love-lorn Tzeitel. Leonard Frey, who had a small role in the original Broadway production, takes over the role of the tailor Motel Kamzoil and sings the beautiful love song ""Miracle of Miracles"", showing a lot of heart and life in this presumably straight-laced young man.From there, the two other daughters show their own rebellion, and Tevye's frustration grows. Topol is outstanding as Tevye's traditions are threatened but he finds conflict in his own heart because of his great love for his daughters. He must then confront his own past with Golde, an arranged marriage which introduced them on their own wedding day. While Golde is a bit hard on the surface, you know she is filled with love, at first obvious for her daughters, and even more begrudgingly later for the husband she was seemingly forced to spend the rest of her life dedicated to serving him. ""Barking at the servants day and night!"", Tevye sings in the show-stopping ""If I Were a Rich Man"", describing his seemingly harpy wife who has more dimensions than meets the eye.Molly Picon is adorable as Yente the Matchmaker, and as in everything she ever did on screen, she makes you just want to hug her, even if she is a bit of an unromantic in the way she manipulates every young person's love life. The shot of her at a wedding during the profound ""Sunrise, Sunset"" is truly revealing as she too can't deny the power of young love, even if it potentially means the end of her life-long profession. Then, there's ""Tevye's Dream"", the fantasy sequence where Tevye must convince Golde that Lazar Wolfe is not the right match for their daughter. Extremely lavish and slightly camp (especially with the vision of Lazar's late wife Fruma Sarah), it is both a comical and scary nightmare, like something out of a British Hammer horror film.The long Broadway run featured many Tevye's (most famously the original, Zero Mostel), and Topol, who headlined the British production, is outstanding in every sense. It has been revived many times on Broadway, most recently as 2003 (for a two-year run), and will soon celebrate its 50th Anniversary. The wonderfully sentimental and witty lyrics of Sheldon Harnick (still around as of this writing at the spry age of 90!) and the gorgeous score by Jerry Bock surround a brilliant book, and the production values on this movie are simply breathtaking. Director Norman Jewison and his crew provide many details into the traditions of the Russian Jews of this era that are simple for us Gentiles to catch onto, and you may find yourself engulfed in the culture of these passionate people who would find even more serious struggles in the decades to come. Books on this history of this show and movie give more detail as to the meanings of certain words and phrases, and open the eyes of us who want to reach beyond our own lives and embrace the different cultures of the world. To Life, indeed!"
"When United Artists hired the Toronto native Norman Jewison, they thought that he was Jewish. When Jewison met with the producers for the first time, he informed them: ""You know I'm not Jewish . . . right?""""Fiddler on the Roof"" qualified as the first commercially successful English-language play about Jewish life in Eastern Europe. The story takes place is in Tsarist Russia in 1905 in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka. Tony Awarding-winning playwright Joseph Stein wrote the Broadway musical as well as the screenplay, and Stein drew his material from the story ""Tevye and his Daughters"" (or Tevye the Milkman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. Aleichem has the distinction of being the first to write children's literature in Yiddish. The story focuses on Tevye, a poor dairyman with five daughters, and his tireless efforts to preserve his family and religious traditions against a changing world. Tevye must deal with not only the strong-minded exploits of his three older daughters—Tzeitel, Hodel, and Chava--each embraces a husband who represent a departure farther away from the customs of her faith—but also with the Tsar's edict that evicts the Jews from their village.The poster for the Jewison movie comes from Russian artist Marc Chagall's painting entitled 'The Dead Man' and it depicts a wily violinist perched atop a roof during a funeral. Tevye (Topol) uses the 'fiddler on the roof' metaphor for his efforts to survive in a rapidly changing world. Tevye refers to the instability that ignoring traditions would create when he observes ""Our lives would be as shaky as a fiddler on the roof."" United Artists hired Israeli actor Chaim Topol to play Tevye, partly because he had originated The film was eventually shot on location in rural Yugoslavia in what is now called Croatia.""Fiddler"" relates its story through narration addressed to the audience. The protagonist Tevye (Topol) breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience. He explains that the equanimity that the Jews of Anatevka have acquired from obedience to their ancient traditions is what keeps them going. We know that Tevye is a religious man because he speaks to God regularly. According to Tevye, the welfare of the Jews is as precarious as a 'fiddler on the roof.' In other words, it is no picnic playing a winsome tune while no breaking their backs with work. This figure steps in and out of the action over the course of the three hours to remind us about the eternal obstacles that confront the Jews. Despite the vast differences of time and setting, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" qualifies as a Jewish version of ""Gone with the Wind."" Change assails the characters here as they do the families in the antebellum South in Margret Mitchell's masterpiece. Like the ""Gone with the Wind's"" Rhett Butler, Tevye discovers new inner strength in spite of the toll that these overwhelming changes exact on his life.Initially, Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris of ""The Cotton Club""), through the village matchmaker Yente (Molly Picon of ""Come Blow Your Horn"") to wed wealthy butcher Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann), who is considerably older than Tzeitel. Instead, Tzeitel has fallen in love with her childhood friend, Motel (Leonard Frey of ""Finnegan's Wake""), who is a lowly tailor. Motel pleads with Tevye not to marry his daughter off to an older man. Tevye hatches a crazy scheme to rescind his original plans for Tzeitel. He tells Golde (Norma Crane of ""Tea and Sympathy"") that he has had a nightmare. In the nightmare, Golde's dead grandmother advised him that Tzeitel ought to become Motel's wife as Heaven has decreed. Tevye reveals that Lazar Wolf's dead wife Fruma-Sarah has warned him that should Tzeitel marry Lazar, Fruma-Sarah will make sure that Tzeitel dies three weeks after marriage. This nightmare scene is about as surreal as ""Fiddler on the Roof"" gets with Tevye and Golde in their big bed in the middle of a graveyard while zombified relatives warble tunes. Predictably, Lazar Wolf is happy with this reversal of fate. Meanwhile, the specter of anti-Semitism rears its ugly head in the same scene that introduces us to Perchik (Paul Michael Glaser of TV's ""Starsky & Hutch"") as he meets Tevye near the town square. The Jews are discussing a recent edict that forced Jews to abandon their homes in a distant town. Essentially, Perchik is a young Marxist, anti-monarch student from the university with noble ideals. He argues that the rich prey on the poor. Tevye hires him to tutor his daughters and he pays Perchik off with food. Later, Model and Tzeitel are married. Tevye later learns that Hodel and Perchik have pledged themselves to each other. Shocked, Tevye gives them not only his blessing but also his permission. Tevye is quite so liberal when he disowns his third daughter, Chava (Neva Small of ""The Laser Man""), for marrying a young Russian Gentile, Fyedka (Ray Lovelock of ""The Cassandra Crossing"") outside of her faith. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" illustrates the tenacity of the human spirit as the Jews, particularly Tevye contend with the ever-changing world. Several ""Fiddler"" songs have become classics, such as ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker,"" ""Miracle of Miracles,"" ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" and ""Do You Love Me."" Jewison summarized ""Fiddler on the Roof"" as ""the story of a man and his God, and his problems with his five daughters."""
"In pre-revolution Russia the Jews are allowed to live in a small enclave village as long as they keep a low profile and serve the general population. In this setting a peasant farmer wants to marry off his three daughters - but he only gets trouble, trouble, trouble...The film musical is a strange fish in that it can be an absolutely brilliant way to tell a story or the worst. However well you to put it- the sight of people suddenly bursting in to song to make a point or illustrate information is quite strange and there are many that can't quite get their heads around it. Certainly it shouts ""this is not real life"" more than any device in the history of cinema and you half expect the camera to pan around and watch the orchestra playing the music! The format works far more effectively when the central music is also central to the theme itself. Such as in A Star is Born or Cabaret. We expect music to sung on a stage - but in the middle of a street with people passing by as if this was the most normal thing in the world?The music in Fiddler is only average and strangely dated even for the time it was made. It wasn't a film musical that ""had to be made"". In If I Was a Rich Man we have an all-time classic and in Sun Rise/Sun Set a minor classic - but the rest is mediocre, although sometimes made brilliant by fantastic dance or visuals. We can't go back in time and understand Topol (the poor farmer) any more than we can understand MacBeth. We have had too much education. He sees himself as a man whose only goal is to continue to fight for his traditions and the idea of his daughter marrying a Gentile sends him in to apoplexy. We don't understand him today - indeed we are angry with his for his narrow mind - but this is the spool which his whole life is spun around.This film made me interested in history. To try and understand what is going on off screen. What the politics of the day were. My reading is that Jews were allowed certain plots of land because it was thought that they were hard workers who brought trade to an area - but they were not trusted and became something of a mixed blessing. The cruelty they suffered was often as a result of their own success - because success brings jealousy. I have only positive thoughts on this film. Yes, I wish the music was better and there was more of the fantastic dancing. I also wish that the politics of the day were better explained - although I don't know how.We know what lay in store for them (the Jews) later in life - but the lucky ones got to America a country that has always been their natural home. A place where hard work and success are admired and people don't come round to smash up your wedding - they simply don't let you join their golf club."
"""Fiddler on the Roof"" is one of those movies, similar to an opera, which presents itself in a playfully entertaining medium- while exposing deep seeded conflict of religious faith and historical political persecution. The protagonist is Tevye, is brilliantly portrayed by Topol.  Tevye embodies the ""old guard"" traditions of his Orthodox Judaism.  He always covers his head with a hat, and wears a prayer shall under his outfit.  Living in a closed traditional Jewish village, Tevye accepts his social ""caste"" as a farmer, by trade.  He sings, ""If I were a rich man...,"" but his conflict lies not with material or social standing, but with the traditions of ancient Russian-Jewish living.  You see, tradition is the thesis of conflict in this story.  Tevye notes that they have traditions that tell them, ""how to eat, how to sleep, how to work...""  His closely held values are attacked throughout the whole story.  First, his daughter Yente fights the matchmaking system of the father choosing a husband for his daughter.  For she loves a poor tailor, but Tevye and the matchmaker have an older wealthy butcher eyed up for her.  Love is the key.  Marriage out of love was not a luxury in their society, as we have today.  However, Yente challenges the institutions of Tevye's world .  He eventually gives in to her, but not after cursing out loud, ""What ever happened to tradition!""  As the story moves on, Tevye faces a hardship unlike any other.  His third daughter wishes to marry an outsider- a Russian farmer.  They love each other.  Tevye is at a crossroads.  He won't give in any further, as he has eroded the traditions enough.  In a sad moment, Tevye disenfranchises himself from his daughter for her behavior.  All the while this is going on, the harsh reality of the Bolshevik Revolution comes into play.  The village Constable, a Russian, turns on his old Jewish friends- terrorizing Yente's wedding party.  The evident persecution of Jews in East Russia is captured in this story, as Tevye's family must eventually leave their village by an edict from Lenin.  A short time after, in real life, Lenin and Stalin murdered and persecuted more Jews than Hitler, a point the story implies.My conclusions to the themes of this movie are as follows.  The author of this story smoothly advocates a change from strict Orthodoxy to Western modernism.  Marriage out of love, as opposed to arrangement, is more desirable.  However, he also implies that some traditions are too grandiose to part with.  One being inter-cultural marriage.  For as they were a small village of Orthodox Jews, the culture and religious faith must be maintained.  This is only possible with intermarriage among the Jews.  Tevye strongly opposed his daughters love for a Russian farmer, as he was not one of them.  Whether for good or bad, the author of this story valued highly the sacred culture of Judaism; having it intermingled or watered down by outsiders is to be opposed.  Finally, the historical reality of persecution of Jews comes alive in this film.  When I saw the film as a youth, I asked my father, ""Why are they being mean to those people?  They didn't do anything wrong to the Russians.""  Having been educated on Nazi Germany and Stalin Russia, I now understand the answer to that question.  Whether you are a Jew or non-Jew, the ""Fiddler on the Roof"" paints a portrait of one historic time when Jews were persecuted against greatly- and you must acknowledge that as a viewer.  A truly great classic.  To parents:  this movie should only be seen by children who are mature and understand the concepts of political and religious history, as this is NOT another Disney musical.  The intense religious, moral, and historic concepts of this movie are not to be wasted on the blanket image that ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is a happy and simple musical movie."
"If you like musicals, this is a must see.  About a poor Jewish man, whose daughters all get married away, taking place during WWI.  Great music, and Topol is wonderful.  Even if you don't like musicals, definitely see this one"
"What can I say? I'm Jewish and I liked it. Singing, dancing, talking, arguing, and of course tradition all visit with us and lift us up and capture us in the moment. We become part of the film with ease thus we hang on every word of Tevye played by Topol who the movie centers around. One of the songs ""if I were a rich man"" should touch everyone who is or is not rich because we all think the same. The Russian dance scene will pump up your blood and then will have you out of your chair and the prayer before the Sabbath is something to be remembered. Who wouldn't want to bless their family before eating? Ah yes the fiddler. Trying to make a go of it all wherever he is and in whatever he is doing never giving up but instead keeping that song in his heart. Got 3.5 hours on your hands? You do? then....."
"To celebrate my 1600th review for this site I turn to another of my favourite films. Like a number of other cinematic genres, such as the war film and the Western, the traditional Hollywood musical was to go into something of a decline in the late seventies, but the early part of the decade had seen two very fine examples, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Cabaret"". ""Fiddler"" is set in the Russian village of Anatevka in 1905. Actually, Anatevka is really two villages, one Jewish and one Christian, and there is little interaction between the two. Nearly all the main characters are drawn from the Jewish community.It amazes me that anti-Semites have sometimes attempted to brand Jews ""rootless cosmopolitans"", as Jewish communities have always struck me as very conscious of their roots, their traditions and identity. The film, like the Broadway musical on which it is based, can be seen as an exploration of the role of tradition in Jewish life. In the opening song, actually entitled ""Tradition"", the main character Tevye explains the importance of tradition to him and his neighbours. Several Jewish traditions, including a wedding and a Sabbath meal, are reproduced in the film.The film, however, also shows how the traditions which Tevye holds so dear are being challenged from within and threatened from without. Within Anatevka and the wider Jewish community the younger generation are starting to question the values which their parents have lived by. The threat from outside comes from state-sponsored anti-Semitism in the form of the pogroms. The film's title comes from a line of Tevye's; he compares the predicament of Russian Jews to that of a fiddler on the roof, desperately trying to keep his footing and to play a merry tune while in a precarious situation. Tevye intends this as a metaphor, but an actual fiddler appears in the film at various points.The story is a simple one. Tevye, a poor village milkman, and his wife Golde have five daughters but no sons. The three elder girls are all of marriageable age (the younger two are just children), and all three find husbands who, in one way or another, represent a breach with tradition. Tzeitel, the eldest, would rather marry her childhood sweetheart Motel, a poor tailor, rather than the wealthy but elderly widower found for her by the village matchmaker. Hodel, the second daughter, falls in love with Perchik, a politically radical student, and stands by him even when he is exiled to Siberia for his part in a demonstration. And the third daughter, Chava, wants to marry a Gentile. (Motel and Perchik are both Jewish). Marrying outside the faith is a step too far for Tevye, even though his love for his family has led him to give his blessing to Tzeitel and (rather reluctantly) to Hodel. He refuses Chava his permission to marry, and disowns her when she defies him by marrying her beloved in a Christian ceremony.There are a number of reasons why I have long regarded this as one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, of all screen musicals. The first is that the songs (music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick) are very fine ones. They range from the rousing (""Tradition"", ""To Life!"") to the deeply moving (""Sunrise, Sunset"", ""Far from the Home I Love"") to the humorous (""Matchmaker, Matchmaker""), although the humour is sometimes rather dark. The song ""If I Were a Rich Man"", for example, contains some humorous descriptions of Tevye's imagined life if he were to become rich, yet is also a complaint addressed to the heavens against his poverty.The second reason why I love this film is the performance of Topol in the central role. Tevye is the dominant figure in the film, not only its main character but also its narrator, addressing the audience directly. Topol, only 36 at the time, was considerably younger than the part he was playing; Tevye, the father of three adult daughters, is probably supposed to be at least ten years older. The makeup department do a good job in making him look older, but Topol nevertheless brings a younger man's energy and vitality to the part, making a Tevye powerful, larger- than-life figure. He also has a fine singing voice. There are too many good supporting performances to mention them all, but I must single out Norma Crane as Golde, Leonard Frey as the timid Motel and a pre-""Starsky and Hutch"" Paul Michael Glaser (here billed simply as ""Michael"") as the idealistic Perchik.My final reason for loving the film is the direction of Norman Jewison. (According to one story, he was only given the job because he was wrongly thought to be Jewish because of his surname). The original Broadway production was dominated by bright colours, inspired by the art of Marc Chagall, but the look of the film is much more realistic; the only time it veers into fantasy is during Tevye's dream sequence. (Location shooting actually took place in Yugoslavia, about the only part of Eastern Europe where American film crews would have been welcome in 1971). I think that this was the right decision; what works well on stage is not always the right choice in a film. Jewison's sombre photography helps to anchor the film in a particular place and time but also adds to its timeless appeal. The villagers of Anatevka are people we can identify with, who speak to us through the years about the problems of their own time and of ours. (Nobody can watch the film without being uncomfortably aware that in years to come the Jewish population of Eastern Europe were to suffer tribulations far worse than anything the Tsarist regime could devise). Jewison, Bock, Harnick and all those involved with the film invest it with the universality which is the hallmark of all great art. 10/10"
"I have had a love affair with this musical movie for over 35 years. Although it came out the year I was born, i saw it for the first time when i was about 5 and even though i was too young to understand a lot of it, i felt a connection with the story, the characters and exspecialy the music. As I got older the movie just kept getting better and i never tired, and still don't, of this masterpiece of cinema. This is not just a ""Jewish"" movie, everyone can identify the story and love it. ""Topol"" as the poor milkman with five daughters, embodies the part to perfection. He has not only the singing chops but the demeanor and quick wit of the character. The other cast members are fantastic as well, ex specially ""Leonard Frye"" as Motel the tailor. Oh and what music! I dare anybody to watch this movie and not walk away from it humming at least a few of the tunes. My personal favorites are ""If i were a rich man"" and ""Sunrise and Sunset"". Movie musicals of recent years have been hit and miss. For example ""Chicago"" was great but ""Mama Mia"" was schlock, pure and simple. ""Fiddler"" is legendary! See it!"
"This is not a ""Hollywood Musical"" per se.""Singing in the rain"" it isn't. There are no virtuoso dancers,extravagant costumes,jazzy orchestrations ,comic misunderstandings or other staples of that genre.Instead of the frankly rather silly clichés that pass as plots to hang a few song and dance numbers on ,""Fiddler on the roof"" says more about real human beings than the entire works of Messrs Rodgers,Hammerstein,Porter,Kern,Gershwin,Henderson da Silva and Brown put together.Only Stephen Sondheim comes close. It is so sui generis that only ""Rich man ""has much of a life outside the show,but all the other songs fit beautifully in their proper context. Topol is extraordinary,and I use that term in the full knowledge that most of the time nowadays it is taken to mean merely very good. It is a musical for grown ups .In today's soundbite society where ten minutes is too long ,it would never get made."
"(This commentary contains some spoiler information.)  The opening monologue by Tevye sets up the theme of the movie immediately--namely, that certain traditional values rule the population of Anatevka, and the people like it that way.  Then, throughout the course of the movie, these traditional values are slowly stripped away, as represented by the marriages of Tevye's three oldest daughters.  (As Tevye so aptly states, ""one little time you pull out a thread, and where has it led?"")  Tzeitel is pretty traditional, as is shown by the fact that she doesn't want her mother to dance with her father at her wedding.  But she wants to marry the man she loves, instead of going through with an arranged match.  Hodel goes a step further and marries a non-traditional Jew.  (Also, she only asks for her father's blessing, not even his permission.)  And Chava goes furthest when she is married by a priest to a Gentile.  It is interesting to note that unpleasant events follow all of the daughters' choices.  A pogrom interrupts Tzeitel's wedding.  Hodel's fiance is arrested and sent to Siberia.  And the Jews of Anatevka are evicted right on the heels of Chava's elopement.  So IMO, the message is clear: tradition must be modified to accomodate the changing times, as well as people's most basic needs and desires, as even Tevye recognizes.  But society should be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and respect traditional values to some degree (or as Tevye put it, ""If I bend that far, I will break"").  In all, the casting is perfect, the music is uplifting, and the message is very appropiate for our changing times."
"After 43 years, I eventually got to see Fiddler on the Roof and it was well worth the wait! What a touching, beautiful portrayal of life in an exiled Jewish community in Russia (or was it the Ukraine?) around the turn of the 20th century. The star of the film is undoubtedly Topol as Tevye a subsistence milkman, the head of his family of wife and five daughters but there were certainly many others. His wife, Golde (Norma Crane - who died just two years after ""Fiddler"" of breast cancer) and his three oldest daughters Yente (Molly Picon), Hodel (Michele Marsh) and Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris) captured the modest yet determined characters of male-dominated Jewish women at a time when traditions (a word yelled by Tevye many times in exasperation throughout the movie) were irreversibly changing. As we learn during the story, Tevye and Golda first met each other on their wedding day and were told that, in time, they would learn to love each other. The scene where they actually admit this is absolutely beautiful.However, starting with Yente, Tevye and Golda's daughters rebel against century-old tradition and choose their own marriage partners - even though old ways don't die easily and, being the soft-hearted, loving father that he is, Tevye succumbs to their wishes until Tzeitel announces her love for a gentile and that is just too much for her father who (initially) disowns her.One amusing (to me) scene was where Hodel and her man, Perchic (played by Paul Michael Glaser of Starsky and Hutch fame) express their love for each other. As I watched the scene I was frequently reminded of Sheldon and Amy of TV's Big Bang Theory. (I guess you need to watch both to see it but it did make me smile!)I won't write about the ending to the movie as that would tend to be a spoiler too far. Just let me say Fiddler on the Roof is a very believable story of love, loyalty and sheer doggedness that is an inspiration to anyone who is experiencing difficult times. As I say, well worth the long wait!"
"The plot of this movie is told very well without one lyric or note, and so while the songs are all great, they slow down the plot and rhythm of interest. I grew up around community theater so it is still enjoyable for me, but for the average viewer it may induce sleep. Try to stick with it, though, as it gets really better halfway through.The best musicals carry on the plot for you during at least some of the songs if not all. Fiddler does have a handful of songs that add info, but since there are SEVERAL numbers, I yearned for either less of them or for them to tell me more. It does move the plot along with enough songs to still be a good, if bulky, musical.A good number is after Tevye discovers that his eldest daughter and the tailor pledged their love a year prior, and he's struck a deal for her with the butcher. That number was perfect. Next, though the number in the woods between the two lovebirds was nice and gave them a performance, but I got up and did something else, it bored me.Also, in the beginning, Tevye's barn number, while long, explains his love for knowledge. And the clothesline number with the daughters was pleasant and showed me how they all really felt about getting a match. And, the dream scene where Tevye explains to Golde about why the tailor should get Tzeitel instead of the butcher: this is IMO the best example in Fiddler of how the plot is enhanced by a musical number. ""Sunrise, Sunset"", Tzeitel's wedding, was my most favorite number. I loved the dance part.Those are some examples. In exchange for your perseverance, you will see excellent performances from everyone. A very young Paul Michael Glaser is really good and he amazed me, since all I knew of him was Starsky & Hutch.The serious subplot of Jewish persecution is also intriguing. It ain't all about just matchmaking.One more thing, it leaves you feeling very good. If you enjoy watching things like the Godfather Trilogy in one sitting, then you can handle Fiddler."
"Its virtue - it works at each age. for children - to discover the universe of a shtetl. for young man - for understand the premises of Shoah. for adult - to compare the artistic virtues and the admirable humor. for an old viewer - for say, again and again, ""this is the truth/reality/life"" but, in same measure ,for remind than ""on the other hand"", life is magnificent. for a long time, at early age, Topol was my hero. not only for performance - great and impressive. but for the science to birth a form of magic who gives the profound sense of life. so, fascinating. like the best cure for every day sickness."
"Fiddler of the Roof was one of the earliest films I remember watching. Almost tradition (no pun intended), Fiddler on the Roof was viewed on nearly every Jewish holiday, giving me the reward of all the great songs and dances that this film had to offer. But besides the great music, Fiddler on the Roof was actually a great extraordinary film. The story was Captavating and the acting was unbelievably good. A film that is so educational that you can learn everything about the fascist era by just watching this film. On of the greats. Whilst musical films aren't really my thing, Fiddler on the Roof is an exception to that rule. Truly entertaining and fantastic, Fiddler on the Roof gives you enough good story, coupled with amazing characterisation that you could watch this endless amounts of time and never get bored."
"How could I give Fiddler on the Roof anything less than 10/10 when it is the closest thing any musical has come to perfection! Without a doubt, Topol's portrayal of Tevye, the Jewish peasant desperate to find good Jewish husbands for his daughters, is one of the greatest performances captured on film. He puts 100% into every little bit giving as perfect a performance at the end as he does at the start. For me, the highlight is still the ever-so-singable 'If I Were A Rich Man' which you almost can't sing without feeling the urge to shrug those shoulders in time with the music! But that sounds like I am dismissing the other wonderful songs which I most certainly am not. How could I when such beautiful melodies as that in 'Sunrise, Sunset' live long in the memory while the funnily desperate sentiments expressed in 'Matchmaker' just make you thankful we don't go through all that palaver to find a marriage partner these days... well, I didn't! :o) 1971, 35 years ago, not that far short of my entire lifetime, yet this musical feels as fresh and vibrant today as it did the day it was first released.I love musicals, I have a wide collection and play many instruments myself but nothing I have elsewhere in my collection nor anything I could ever produce on an instrument could ever come close to Fiddler. The greatest musical ever made into a film. Who cares that it goes on forever? Long may it do so! Cheers, Rob Barron"
"okay, this movie is awesome! It's got humour, romance, funfunfun!! And dancing, OH!! The dancing! A marvelous film, I must say!! Best music, EVER! perfect for singing in the gym locker room!"
"Great movie, watched it again today. Music is excellent, you are bound to know at least some of the songs. Weird to see Paul Michael Glaser in a role of this kind (in the movie his name on the credits is Paul Glaser)."
"The story of a man steeped in tradition living in a world where traditions are being thrown out the window (""Unheard of -- absurd!"")  As many times as I have seen this movie, I never fail to laugh and cry and sing along.  My favorite moments include Tevye's song ""If I Were a Rich Man"", the scene where Fyedka introduces himself to Chava, and at the end of the movie, the song ""Anatevka"", which invariably reduces me to tears."
"A popular film adaptation of the stage musical, although I think this has more to do with the fact that Jews run Hollywood than its quality as a movie. For FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is a long, slow and extremely heavy-going movie, for which the lengthiness of its story is never offset by the quality of the music.Topol - the only actor in the film to give a notable performance - gives a solid performance as a poor Jewish man struggling to bring up five daughters in 19th century Russia. The various sub-plots that follow involve him pairing off his daughters with varying suitors (along the lines of PRIDE & PREJUDICE) while a growing pogrom against the Jews is developing in the background.Some of the songs are very good, particularly ""Tradition"" and ""If I Were a Rich Man"", but in between these are simply lots of long, drawn out sequences of nothing much happening. In fact, despite the extreme length, I found this to be a fairly empty film, without a great deal of depth or, indeed, substance; everything you see is on the surface, and that's it. This is why I didn't like it very much and it's certainly not a film I can envisage sitting through again when there are so many better, more vibrant musicals out there."
"This disappointed me mainly because it looked so promising in the beginning. At first this appeared to be an enormously-entertaining story and solid religious one with the main character talking to God all the time.However, after 90 minutes of viewing this, I wondered if only God could sustain enough interest to keep going. Man, it was b-o-r-i-n-g!Since I like Israeli songs with all the violin music - and the title infers that, too - I hoped to at least hear a lot of that. Wrong again. Most of songs didn't feature that and they weren't anything to write home about. When they did have some dance tunes that were lively, they - like the movie - went on forever. To be fair some of the songs were good and a few of them became famous, thanks to this stage play-turned-movie, but not enough of them to suit me.Another thing that turned me off was the typical '60s-70s youth culture propaganda in which the message here was that the old traditions and the people who believed in them are shown to be of little value while the younger man with his new views is shown to be ""enlightened."" This is such typical Liberal baloney. However, it was nice to see a made-for- adults early '70s movie that was not sleazy. Hallelujah! If they had cut this from three to two hours, it might have been a lot more watchable. This is way too long and way too overrated."
"I was a little late to the game when it came to Fiddler on the Roof. It seemed to be a movie every single person has seen, but now I have joined the party. Based off the very famous stage play, this film takes place in a pre-revolutionary village in Russia where there is a mixture of the Jewish and Christian people whom each have their own traditions. This film has a major theme in tradition, told from the view of the Jewish peasantry. The message regarding tradition is that times change and sometimes tradition has to be changed to keep up with the changing times. This film particularly talks about traditional marriage within a Jewish family, and how some events changed the very old traditions. Not only is the film about tradition or culture, but you can learn some history. This movie has a setting in pre-revolutionary Russia just before the Russian Revolution of 1918. The Jewish people are being exiled from their home over the course of the film to places like Israel or even Chicago. One of the iconic figures in the movie was the fiddle player-hence the title name. The fiddle player is shown in two very iconic shots-one at the opening and one at the end. This is a symbol for the tolerance or the forbearance of the Jewish people in the movie.This film, which is well-directed by Norman Jewison, is a musical that takes place in pre-revolutionary Russia (just barely). This is a country that struggles to modernize. Maybe a reason is because of the Jewish peasantry, whom hold dear to their traditions. One of the traditions is having a matchmaker pair up matches for people who are of age to marry. There is Trevye (Topol), who is a poor milkman who has five daughters of his own-three ready to marry. The matchmaker, of course, pairs his daughters up. But instead of arraigned marriages, the daughters find love. The eldest daughter falls in love with a poor furniture-maker and his second-eldest falls in love with a Marxist, causing anguish in Trevye as he sees tradition falling apart. Meanwhile, revolution is spreading across the country forcing all Jewish people to leave their homes and their country.This film, just like the stage play, is a musical. There are a lot of songs and dancing. I liked most of the songs, but two that stood out to me were ""Tradition"" which was the opening number as Trevye discusses the tradition of his people and ""If I Were A Rich Man"" which as Trevye lamenting his life and wondering how different it would be if he had money. From what I heard, the music is very faithful to the play. But there were a couple new songs added specifically for the film. It shouldn't be a surprise how good the music is because the legendary John Williams is at the helm as composer-one of his very first gigs in the film industry. As for the dancing, there is a good amount of choreography. I liked that Jewison made the dancing appropriate for the movie audience, not the play audience. Older musicals had problems where I felt I was watching a play, not a musical. Anyhow, there is a rather strange dislike about the dancing of Trevye. He moves his hands in such a weird fashion. I was like, ""Dude, don't make me tie your hands up when you are dancing!"" The film is reasonably well-acted. When I saw the cast, I haven't heard of a single name. Topol apparently is a well-respected Israeli actor and other than those distracting hand movements, he did a wonderful job. His singing was emotionally-charged as everything around him changes. He is a man of tradition, but even he can be persuaded. When asked by his daughters about marriage, he goes on a rant each time with God pleading why this has to happen to him. They are powerful scenes that rightfully nominated him for an Oscar. Leonard Frey as Motel, the lover of the eldest daughter does a solid job. I love his scene where he builds a sowing machine with giddy delight and holds it as if its his own baby. As for the daughters, I can't recall any names. They are just there to fall in love and play daughter to their father. They didn't have much characterization.Nominated for eight Oscars and winning three of them, Fiddler on the Roof is a very faithful adaptation of the Broadway musical. I didn't go nuts over the film, but it's perfectly enjoyable. It's nice to learn about the history and culture of a group of people (from Russia) I did not know too much about. I studied the Russian Revolution, but not so much what happens before. The music is mostly enjoyable and keep an eye out for the fiddle player. The film is very lengthy, but this is an adaptation that pleased fans of the play and general musical fans over the years.My Grade: B+"
"The title comes from a painting by Russian artist Marc Chagall called ""The Dead Man"" which depicts a funeral scene and shows a man playing a violin on a rooftop. It is also used by Tevye in the story as a metaphor for trying to survive in a difficult, constantly changing world. The best musical numbers: ""Tradition"", ""If I Were a Rich Man"", ""To Life"", & ""Miracle of Miracles"". Each of the performances had their highlights, but Topol, who played Tevye, stood far above the rest. Without him, I am not sure the musical would have been as impressive. The entire film had a down to earth, farm life feel. Thus, I was not so shocked as amused when I discovered that the entire film was shot with a pair of brown nylon stockings over the lens. The weave can even be detected in some scenes. One of the most fun, playful musicals I have seen. Which made the sudden ending all the more depressingly stark in contrast."
"Inspired by the Tevye the Dairyman stories of Sholem Aleichem, the great Yiddish Renaissance writer and playwright, Fiddler on the Roof has its critics. The heavyweight political analyst and cultural critic David P. Goldman (himself Jewish) has indicated he despises Fiddler, as a sentimentalist, corrupted version of the original works that inspired it. Persons who don't appreciate music or musicals may also be left cold by this 1971 movie. But such purist and crabbed views will gain little traction against the large and continuing cultural impact of this film, and the stage play that preceded it, which broke Broadway records in its day—nor should they gain traction, in my opinion, as in some cases there is more to great art than historical fidelity to a source. Indeed, this work, although ""merely"" a musical, opens important dimensions of historical awareness for its audience that, even if rendered somewhat imperfectly, would in all likelihood otherwise have remained closed—assuming the audience doesn't already know a lot about Russian history. The story revolves around the highly sympathetic figure of Tevye the Dairyman, played marvelously by Topol, who with his cows and lame horse (a companion more than a helper) ekes out a grinding existence for his wife and five daughters while reflecting on God's mysterious ways and the dramatic changes underway in his world. As the cruel and dreaded pogroms (persecutions, attacks and murders by Christians, sometimes abetted by the Tsar) reach his village and his daughters encounter and fall in love with young men of uncertain (and even forbidden) favor, Tevye must make a series of increasingly difficult choices, for himself and his family. Set in 1905 Russia as the Bolshevik Revolution winds up, this movie offers an excellent introduction---not a detailed study, but an introduction---to Russia's fascinating history in this period, while giving a great flavor of traditional Jewish village culture in the Pale of Settlement, the age-old homelands of Jews in rural Russia. Throughout, Fiddler offers plenty of Yiddish humor, known for its excellent and ironic joke-craft. According to Wikipedia the work is performed in high schools and play clubs over 500 times a year in the USA alone. With great music and a number of powerful, melodic and unforgettable songs, Fiddler on the Roof deserves its place in the canon of American classics."
"This Movie is so popular I even knew the Songs before I'd seen the Movie. It's seriously lives up to its expectations and much more... I feel Modern Movies lack the ability to create so much tension and drama without the use of dialogue or soundtracks. Much the same as The Sound of Music, I had no idea this Film had such a dark Storyline and it's rare to see a Movie breaking the Hollywood Mold for a ""Happy Ending"". Chaim Topol's acting of this Character had the perfect balance between being a Strong Mans Man and the humour of always doing as he pleases but at the same time backing down to his Wife. One of the best Musicals ever made. Absolutely Brilliant!!"
"Norman Jewison's adaptation of Jerry Bock's musical masterfully tells the story of poor Jewish milkman Tevye (Chaim Topol) having to deal with the dying out of traditions, as well as anti-Semitism in tsarist Russia. The obvious metaphor is the title character representing the situation of the Jews in Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, but the movie also seems to be alluding to the generation gap. Much like how young people across the world had little in common with the parents generation by 1971, Tevye's daughters want to find husbands on their own, rather than have a matchmaker do it.I once saw a stage production of ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and the movie equals it very well. Overall, the movie shows two things. The first is that musicals like ""FotR"" and ""West Side Story"" are easily the best of their genre, tackling less-than-pleasant issues (WSS dealt with racial tension). But also, it affirms that Jewison had made the biggest possible jump from his debut (""Forty Pounds of Trouble"", which I've never seen but heard was vomit-inducingly atrocious). ""Fiddler..."", along with ""The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming"", ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""Rollerball"", ""Other People's Money"" and ""The Hurricane"" show him to be one of the greatest directors of all time.All in all, not only do I recommend this movie to everyone, but I would say that 1971 was possibly the best ever year for cinema: ""Little Murders"", ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", ""Bananas"", ""Carnal Knowledge"", ""Shaft"", ""Willard"", ""The French Connection"", ""The Last Picture Show"" and ""A Clockwork Orange""."
"I read almost all of the comments b/c I just wanted to keep experiencing the movie! I love Fiddler on the Roof. I think it is brilliant. It is a testament to life and trying to make sense of the crazy world around us. So many times a day I say to myself...""on the other hand"". I don't know whether or not the roles should have gone to other people but I do know that the characters are so real and great. It was more like watching a home video than a movie. The words were realistic and the love between family members was very real. The songs in the movie are all so good. I cried during Sunrise/Sunset and laughed during others. I love seeing the father dance. It's so real. Watch this movie. You will love it."
"Life, the late P.G. Wodehouse once sagely observed, is like a piece of lead piping - he was thinking of the innumerable occasions when, quite unexpectedly, we can be zapped by some sudden and unpleasant situation that knocks us for six.  High on that list of potential pices of lead piping are - unfortunately - our own children!  As this film so splendidly illustrates.The central character (Reb Tevye) has three daughters who each represent some dilemma for their father.  One wants to marry a poor tailor; another (unthinkable for Tevye) wants to marry a gentile.  And so on.  How can these demands be squared with tradition? wonders Tevye.  And if this isn't bad enough, there are additional worries for him to think about such as the problem of personal survival amidst increasing anti-Jewish pogroms.  In other words, it is a stressful situation for Tevye and his family.  And faced with stress, a strong-minded parent can so easily (but mistakenly!) try to solve all these problems personally.But no: Tevye has the ability to stand back and see BOTH sides of the problem, and ultimately, he has the emotional courage to let go, so that each of his daughters is free to solve the problem as SHE thinks best.This is a warm, compassionate film.  If it is too long - as some users have suggested - this is to allow the full story to emerge in all its rich, cultural complexity.  The music considerably enhances the mood - sometimes sad, sometimes more jaunty.  A shorter film could not do justice to either the cultural background or the nature of the problems.The person of the fiddler is perhaps better understood not simply as a minor musical distraction, but rather as a symbol of survival or empowerment. Lehayim - TO LIFE!"
"There is something uniquely special (and even authentically magical) about this particular Musical, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and especially the Film directed by Norman Jewison, starring Chaim Topol = playing Tevye, the milkman, and head of Family, keeper of 'Tradition' remembering + appreciating (thru emotionally resonant Song & dance) the massive Joy and unbearable hardship, resourcefully 'surviving' by maximizing tightly enduring family bonds (and resilient 'faith') within the confines of a typical Jewish community 'shtetl' common to eastern-Europe of the 19th Century (and prior).This film paints a heartbreakingly poignant picture of an impoverished, materially poor, but culturally & spiritually very Rich community (in the Russian/Eastern European Shtetls of the Late 19th/very early 20th Century). A typical 'pale-of-settlement' town also Rich in familial bonds, cemented and secured thru Centuries of spiritual belief honoring respected cultural 'Traditions'!This movie does an amazing job of authentically capturing this 'long-Lost' way of Life (in this particular case Jewish) but the transcendent artistic power of ""Fiddler"" is that it seems to represent a 'Universal' story of all our immigrant origins = a Way of Life, I think, very common to most humans, prior to our modern 20th/21st Century technological age. When family & faith was literally all there was to hang onto, daily existence being acutely fragile and uncertain. Mere survival reflecting that proverbial flickering 'candle in the wind' somehow persevering thru intermittent heavy showers & snowstorms.... still finding abundant Joy and significant meaning thru beleaguered everyday struggles.Anyway, not many Films have been able to capture both the fragility/ apprehension/ intense struggle to just survive => contrasted against the countervailing feelings of ecstatic Joy and strong-sense of Belonging & connection to Community.The saddest part, of the broader/ Later Story (for Jewish families, like these), was the terrible Fate awaiting the 'traditionalists' living in All those East European Shtetls (i.e. physical destruction & Death by hands of German Third Reich => or subsequent Soviet 're-education' => with departure/emigration for those fortunate few remaining). In any case, as ""Fiddler"" espouses a once very Rich & thriving 'World' that no longer fully exists in Reality but does Live on through the magic of Film & Song! (and many Books, of course).Interesting note: favorite film composer John Williams, did this marvelous Score adaptation (originally composed by Jerry Bock & Sheldon Harnick for Broadway) - he also did the incredible original Score for ""Schindler's List"" => And, of course, Isaac Stern was the genuine 'Fiddler'!"
"Fiddler on the Roof is a classic, and for good reason. This film is breathtaking in story, music, and execution, and tells a story of beauty in the midst of the suffering and struggle of the 20th century. This is a gem."
"I saw it last night in our local theater that shows ""classic"" movies. It's everything the other reviewers say: funny, poignant, sad, happy, philosophical.... Tevye has a running conversation with God (""Sometimes I think, when it gets too quiet up there, You say to Yourself, ""What kind of mischief can I play on My friend Tevye?"")Topol has played that role so often that it fits him like a velvet glove. It's long, with an intermission (""Entre'acte"" on the screen), but never dull or lagging.The music was conducted and adapted by a young and upcoming film musician named John Williams.Part of Tevye's story is how Tradition keeps their society intact, and how it keeps them stuck in the same roles year after year, and what happens when a younger generation breaks out of that tradition.I'd say that this is one you need to see on the big screen - but with today's giant home screens, that's not true any more. This is one of the best, worth keeping."
"I often wondered what it was like in the old country Russia/Poland one hundred plus years ago? What was the daily riggers of life for my Grandfather and his Father's before him? How did they survive? Their livelihoods, customs, down time?? How they lived or survived the rugged lifestyle with out the modern conveniences? Not to mention the racial tensions created by the local regimes of that time, mainly ""antisemitism""? My Grandmother remembers the harsh winters in Lodz. My other Grandmother would describe the horrible senseless acts of a fearful group of individuals called the Pogroms. These tormentors would ride into the Jewish section on horseback with saber in hand and would slice the heads off the locals including woman and children. Just a small sample of the horrific acts by the government based group to annihilate the Jews of Europe. Despite the harshness of the living conditions, writer Sholom Aleichem presents the story of Tevya the Milkman and his family somewhere in the Ukraine at the turn of the twentieth century. Personally I saw this play performed for the first time at sleep away camp. Then I saw a professional production starring Hershel Bernardi as Tevya. My ex-Brother-In-Law played Tevya in his college production and the story is always captivating with song and dialogue. The film doesn't disappoint either as Topol plays a struggling milkman who tells his audience in a philosophical way his ideas on life as he looks toward the sky to ask G-d why things are? Tradition is most important to Tevya with out an explanation as to why? But because it's a tradition. Tevya has a wife of 25 years Golde (Norma Crane) does a capable job as the matriarch who cooks, cleans and has the Sabbath meal prepared unconditionally. They have five daughters but this story focuses on the three oldest and their love interests. First there's Tzeitel (Rosalind Harris).This was at a time when it was customary in Jewish law to have an arranged marriage done my a Matchmaker (Molly Picon)Yente. Grey,middle aged Lazar Wolf (Paul Mann)is looking for a second wife and Tzeitel fills the requirements under strong suggestion to the austere Tevya. Meanwhile Tzeitel is secretly meeting love interest Motel the tailor(Leonard Frey) and they want to be married but timid Motel has to tell Tevya that despite his hopes of a rich in-law, Motel and Tzeitel have a mutual love for each other and pay no heed to traditions. One of my personal favorite songs is Wonder of Wonders performed by Leonard Frey as his marriage will be a reality with a concocted dream by Tevya to pacify Wolf and Golde. The dream sketch was cleverly done in black and white. The second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) falls for a wondering radical Perchick (Paul Michael Glazer) who wants to go to Moscow and start a Marxist revolution against the Czar. Our third front or daughter is the Ginger haired Chava (Neva Small), who is an avid reader and meets a gentile boy who she eventually falls in love and marries against the wished of her parents as Tevya professed that his daughter is dead to him. Powerful scene in any production of the play. The songs are so familiar and the story on paper, serious in nature is still pleasant to watch. Our character do sprinkle a bit of humor despite the tense political climate brewing in Czarist Russia. Note Norma Crane who played Golde was in bad health during the film yet her performance was a adequate.The kind of play you can get lost in as you see your Jewish ancestry played out literally. Other cultures would ask what Judaism entails? I say watch this play and you'll get quite an education about Diaspora. How millions of Jews Emigrated to the United States because of racial problems and changing governments which prohibited certain religions. You'll enjoy the story and learn a few things about the Chosen People."
"I loved this movie! We get to learn more about the Jewish faith. And we get to see life from so many so many different points of view. From the Father, from the Mother, from each of the 3 oldest daughters and from their 3 beaus, and even from government agents.Talking points - which is easier, young love or love after 50 years of marriage? Which do you think you have to work at more? What do you think of arranged marriages? How were they better or worse than marriages when you choose your own spouse? In what ways is your religion important to you? How would you feel if a child of yours embraced another religion? Do you think it would be easy or hard to see your child get married? What would make it easier or harder? If someone thinks a law is wrong should they enforce that law? To whom do we owe our highest allegiance? Do husbands and wives sometimes disagree? Is that normal? In what ways is disagreement good or bad?"
"""It's hard to be Jewish, it's hard to be Jewish, it's hard to be Jewish in Russia, yo!"" If this irreverent cutaway gag from TV's Community is indicative of Fiddler on the Roof's cultural presence in the 21st century (keeping in mind, this is the same generation that distilled Rent into ""Everybody has Aids!"" in 2004's cheerily crass Team America: World Police), it's a testament to how lovably unforgettable the story is to still incur such affectionate ribbing. But, endless revivals on and off Broadway aside, it's still primarily thanks to Norman Jewison's 1971 cinematic adaptation that the Fiddler flame continues to burn. The word 'timeless' is bandied about far too frivolously, but it's hard to find a more applicable candidate; more than 40 years after its release, the film is as infectiously watchable as ever. Furiously spirited and cunningly playful before revealing an underbelly of cavernous lamentation, Jewison's Fiddler on the Roof holds its place not only as one of the most unforgettable musicals of Classical Hollywood, but one of its most abiding, heartfelt delights. Like all the greatest musicals, Fiddler is timeless through its ability to translate an insightful glimpse into a specific sociocultural moment (the Russian-Jewish community uneasily navigating cultural persecution in pre-revolutionary Russia) into a swathe of universally relatable movie magic. From the opening number, where each reprise of ""Tradition!!"" brings more manic claustrophobia (thanks largely to Jewison's teasing editing, sonorously cutting between pieces of Jewish spiritual iconography to the beat), the film clearly establishes it will be doing everything in its power to poke at just that. Thankfully, the film's almost sitcom setup of each of beleaguered narrator Tevye's daughters (Rosalind Harris, Michele Marsh, & Neva Small; all slyly luminous scene-stealers) increasingly testing the boundaries of cultural transgression by marrying (gasp) for love always veers away from clichéd expectations enough to keep the film vibrantly unpredictable rather than the kind of saccharine staleness too many classical musicals dredge up. Instead, befitting the film's guiding metaphor, Jewison's directorial hand is steady as a rock. In spite of his film's voluminous run time and cascading emotional arc, balancing history, politics, and spirituality with humour, heart, and outrageously catchy musical numbers, Jewison's pacing is unflappably perfect. He finds an almost pristine level of cohesion, building each romantic crisis into the next in harmony with the brewing sociopolitical upheaval to circumvent any worries of episodic plotting. Similarly, his predilection towards the zaniness of his story not only infuses it with tremendous energy (just check out the expressionistic, ghostly insanity of Tevye's Dream to see Jewison's wackiness at full tilt), but makes the inevitable second half crash all the more agonizingly hopeless and despondent. Ahh, yes - that second half. Just as The Sound of Music is incomplete without its pesky Nazis, Fiddler's rumblings of ""trouble in the city"" come with eventual devastating consequence. Jewison wisely doesn't overplay the macro sociocultural turmoil, but merely sows seeds of revolt - a jab in the otherwise glib opening number (""we don't bother them, and so far they don't bother us""); a raucous engagement celebration turned heated cross-cultural dance battle, until escalating sharply with a bawdy matrimony turned hate crime arson. As silly as it gets, Jewison's Fiddler is just as unafraid to glare the horror of its historical atrocities straight in the face, until sputtering out with the crushing anticlimax of an enforced deportation, an ending too necessarily bleak to trivialize. Thankfully, Fiddler is too chock-full of unstoppably hummable tunes to ever become needlessly dour. The songs, naturally, are unforgettable enough to speak for themselves (though John Williams' rich, Oscar-winning background score does some considerable speaking of its own), so Jewison allows them to simply breathe, integrated into the narrative with such unceremonious muckiness that they feel all the more spontaneous and heartfelt when chirped by the mud-caked, visibly weary cast. In a more classical or more contemporary remake, the most iconic ballad, ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" would be accompanied by deluges of glitzy Broadway production values and dazzling choreography. Under Jewison's grainy, no-bullsh*t 1970s sensibilities, it has Topol shimmying alone in a grungy barn, imitating the braying of the livestock surrounding him. Chicago or Broadway Melody this ain't, but it's all the more enthusiastically authentic for it.Still, if there's a single roof tile that keeps this Fiddler upright, it's the legendary performance of Topol. He doesn't so much play Tevye as allow him to ooze out of every pore. Every grunt from his entirely credible Russian accent, every exhausted sag or mischievous prance, every sheepish grin or world-weary grimace, every indignant booming of ""TRADITION?!"" is so effortless they seem worlds away from the affectations of an actor: this is a wholly fleshed out, loving, hurting, human being on screen in front of us, and we can't help but love him with the entirety of our hearts. The play's 'Tevye talking to the audience/God' conceit may have been a risky prospect to translate into film, but in Topol's effervescent hands, we're too delighted to be invited into his monologue to split hairs. Supporting him, Norma Crane proves both hilariously cantankerous and deeply sweet as Tevye's prickly wife Golde, and watching the two of them share an incredulously clumsy romantic duet is one of the most adorable moments ever committed to celluloid. Finally, Leonard Frey is hugely affable and goofy as the mousy suitor of Tevye and Golde's oldest daughter, while Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser raises laughs aplenty as an endearingly self-righteous revolutionary turned romantic. Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles - dispelling all fears of datedness, Fiddler on the Roof retains its worthy place as one of the essential, canonical movie musicals, sure to capture hearts and leave generations of audiences whistling ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" no matter how they're prompted to experience it. After all, it IS, evidently, hard to be Jewish in Russia... yo. -10/10"
"TRADITION! Well actually the movie is about changing, bending, breaking traditions. The Fiddler on the roof as described by Tevye in the opening of the movie is symbolic for existentialism. It is a metaphor for the challenge of balancing your life and knowing your place in the world. Traditional religious rituals and customs give the community where Tevye's family lives the supposed comfort to get through the balancing act. However, Tevye's three oldest daughters challenge tradition in their romantic lives and the ""outside"" world is entering into a time a extreme turmoil. The ways of the older generation clash with those of the younger generation. And through it all Tevye is really pretty progressive for a man in his society.The story is serious and humorous. The film is shot beautifully. The songs are great, some more catchy than others. Tevye's constant dialog with his ""best friend,"" God is thought provoking and often funny.Since it is based on the book Tevye's Daughters, it is appropriate that his daughter's romantic awakenings be the main concern of the plot. The oldest daughter challenges tradition a little by pledging her love to a man of her choice, but he is a (soft-spoken) tailor from the same village and they still have a customary wedding. The middle daughter bends tradition by falling for a progressive teacher and budding revolutionary. I love that in the existential crisis he claims humankind must take much more responsibility for balancing on the roof and that traditions are not going to keep us safe up there. The youngest of the three daughters of marrying age meets another intelligent reader, but he is a Russian Kazakh and Christian. This is breaking the tradition entirely by having a marriage of two faiths. It is because the relationships of the three daughters and the father-daughter relationships are so well rendered that this story is more than a Jewish story."
"Seeking help from Springfield's synagogue to get a coronary bypass operation, Homer Simpson came to Rabbi Kruftosky and told him: ""Now I know I haven't been the best Jew, but I have rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and I will watch it ""' I'll complete this quote later but for now, I understand why ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is highly regarded in the Jewish community, for it provides the most enchanting and entertaining insights on Jewish traditions, 'Tradition' as the motto shouted by all the villagers of the small and peaceful town of Anatevka, in pre- revolutionary Russia, traditions like an immanent symbol of eternity. Sure, traditions and rituals are the tools that men use to construct a feeling of immortality, as a community, hence to overcome the fatality of death. But this is even truer for a community persecuted for centuries and that couldn't even afford an attachment to a land, so the only land Jews could never leave is the one that could never leave them. Hence the powerful symbolism of the title: letting the music speak for the soul of your community on a place that you might fall from. The title offers a poetic vision of a tragic historic reality, conveying the feeling that joy can anytime be followed by tragedy. So, if it can't be eternal, well at least traditions are.Still, the content of these traditions can appeal to every culture, especially oriental: patriarchy, life in community, hard work, social status, marriage, and of course, Family. And all these values are incarnated by a poor farmer and milkman with five daughters: Tevye, played by Topol with an electrifying mix of authority, charisma, magnetism, self-derision and some vulnerability betraying his penetrative eyes in the most dramatic moments. Topol is the friendly host of that epic journey, breaking the fourth wall to share his thoughts with us, and from the way he apostrophes God, who's like the film's second character, he powerfully embodies both the pride and the doom of being the 'chosen people'. Topol as Tevye is a larger-than-life character, carrying the film with such intensity that whenever he's absent, you feel like something is missing. In a way, he indirectly points out the small weaknesses of ""Fiddler on the Roof"".Despite their narrative significance, I didn't feel emotionally engaged by the growing romances through the story's recurring subplots, although I genuinely liked the first two husbands, Motel the tailor and Pershik, the revolutionary student (good old Starsky). But there was something too predictable in the way it was handled. You could tell the movie's point was about traditions being undermined by modernity. First, a marriage with a non-promised, then a non-religious man with Tevye giving his blessings and permissions despite a first negative reaction ... but the twist was on the third daughter marrying a gentile, too much asking for. This time, no blessing, no permission, no ""on the other hand"" reasoning, it was the kind of deathblow to tradition that would have made Grandma Tzeitel roll over in her grave. I wouldn't have minded the predictability, but when a movie, even a light-hearted musical, spans three epic hours, you got enough time to figure out everything, then the feeling introduced by the first act inevitably fades out, especially after the exhilarating ""Lechaim"" part. Besides, there wasn't much in these daughters that could really grab me, the part where they were singing was too Disney-like and the best love story in my eyes, was still between Tevye and his wife Golde (Norma Crane). But trusting Jewison's direction, I wondered why such a long film for a a plot that wouldn't present any twists, I guessed maybe it was a deliberate choice in order to 'distract' the viewer from the real dramatic aspect incarnated by the anti-Semitic threat, the persecutions and the pogroms from the Russian empire, 'distract' as a way to elevate ourselves from this inexplicable level of violence, and keep us in a good spirit, on the roof, listening to the sound of this violin, whose notes are getting more melodramatic.After the wedding sequence, the film takes a more serious course until the inevitable happens when people leave Anatevka for Palestine, Europe or America. Tevye invites the metaphoric fiddler on the roof to accompany him for the new exodus, as to reaffirm the obligatory attachment to tradition, with two fingers pointing at the sky. I felt the ending of the film was a downer but the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was a bittersweet ending. In a powerful moment after the infamous pogrom that ruined the wedding, Tevye raises his hands in disbelief; it's hard not to see how this scene foreshadows more tragic events that would face the unfortunate descendants of these people. And while remembering this scene, from Topol's eyes, I understand and I respect how the movie speaks for a whole community.And because I knew I was going to evoke some tragic events, I'll end this review on a more positive note by fulfilling my promise with Homer Simpson's quote: ""I have rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and I will watch it. Anyhoo, can I have $50,000?"" This desire for money I will forever associate with the iconic ""If I Was a Rich Man"", one of the greatest moments in musicals history. Topol has such a communicative energy that I wish I could have joined his yubby-dibby-dibby-dums, to a feverish and passionate dance. This whole 'Ya Da' part, and the extraordinary ""To Life"" song with the dancing scenes evoke a sense of male fraternity reminding me that I share the same roots of these people if we go till Abraham or the hell with it that we're all part of a same humanity, with traditions, as a clever way to forget about death and raise all our glasses  to Life !"
"Well. I could scarcely believe that I had never seen such a famous movie as ""Fiddler on the Roof"" but there it was in the listings, and I indeed had not. So, I took the three hours and invested it in Norman Jewison's rendering of the famous play. I am not really a fan of musicals, but this one had such charm. Especially from the performance of Topol, who played a rough character with utter (well, I have to use the word again) charm. The (Acadamy award-winning) cinematography was excellent, and the direction unobtrusive. I even liked some of the music. I was already aware of the pogroms and other indignities (to put it mildly) inflicted upon the inhabitants of the Jewish Pale, but I cannot recall ever seeing a movie showing any of it. If you can at all stand musicals, you should probably take the time to see this one."
"Russian Jews in a small Ukrainian farming village in the early 1900s are unaware of the political tensions brewing in the city...and how the new Czarist regime will eventually sweep all of them up into an exodus of change. Popular musical entertainment via Broadway, with heartfelt characters and a universal theme--Old World tradition versus the new ideals--resulting in a production which is alternately robust and bittersweet. The confines of the material (as conceptualized on the stage, where this show ran for nearly eight years) occasionally burdens the narrative, though director Norman Jewison keeps a pretty lively pace. The editing is weak and does the filmmaker no favors, and the camera never seems to be in the right place, however most of the performers are intensely in-tune with this story and bring out the jubilant soul of the piece. Topol stars as simple milkman Tevye, watching as three of his five daughters drift away into the arms of romantic suitors; he consults with God on matters of money and the heart, weighing each circumstance with even reasoning, and compares the attempt at living a common yet balanced life to that of a fiddler on a rooftop. The film would hardly be much more than an old-fashioned, sentimental exercise were it not for Topol, who sings and dances and jiggles across the screen like a circus bear. In Topol, Jewison has found an appropriate way to capture this theatrical happening on film--and actually make it mean something. Several sequences feel lumpen, and too often there's no exaltation at the climax of the musical numbers, but it still works a fiery-eyed kind of magic. *** from ****"
"Director Norman Jewison does all he can to pound the life right out of this screen adaptation of the phenomenally successful Broadway musical, but thanks to the strength of the original material, he doesn't succeed.There are many better screen musicals, but there are also many that are far worse. Suffice it to say that Hollywood, which had churned out one disastrous musical after another for the last decade, finally got back to producing a musical it could be proud of. This beautiful story about a simple milkman in turn-of-the-century Russia who must come to terms with the loss of the safe and only world he has ever known, succeeds on screen largely due to the performance of Topol, who breathes body and soul into Tevye the milkman and creates one of those characters that for ever after you instantly associate with the actor who played him. You can feel him working overtime to keep Jewison's lumbering physical production on its feet, and his efforts prove themselves to be nearly Herculean, since Jewison can't direct a musical number to save his life. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is not a dance musical, but it does have some rousing dance numbers courtesy of Jerome Robbins; however, you wouldn't know it from this movie, since Jewison almost unfailingly chooses the worst camera angle from which to shoot every single frame of the musical portions.What the movie does boast, however, is a glorious version of the musical's beautiful score, left nearly intact and memorably orchestrated by John Williams. It soars and leaps even when the production it's anchored to just sits like a lump.Grade: A-"
"Guys, I don't do musicals, but Fiddler On The Roof is awesome baby! Gals, if you and your man have not seen this movie, get a copy on DVD or VCR, prepare a candle light dinner, serve it with a bottle of wine; than kick back with your man and enjoy the show! Grandparents, call your children and grab your grandchildren (if the latter are over the age of 10) and watch a great movie ""like they used to make""! It's a comedy! It's a drama! It's a non-corny, multi-episodic love story that runs all along the gamut from those experiencing their first loves, to those who have grown comfortably old with their mates. The music? Awesome! The plot? Awesome! The acting? Awesome! The scenery? Awesome! It is a must see picture for people of all ages and persuasions. I have only one regret about seeing this picture. I was absolutely furious that Topol did not win the Oscar for best actor! SHALOM!"
"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF (1971) 9/10SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. MY FAIR LADY. TOP HAT. THE MUSIC MAN. THE SOUND OF MUSIC. AN AMERICAN IN PARIS. THE WIZARD OF OZ. GIGI. WEST SIDE STORY. It's easy to name the classic musicals before 1970, but after... what we have of good... CABARET... ALL THAT JAZZ... HAIR... of course, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. This may be one of the last great musicals, maybe the last, because all the musicals that came after it were really different from the old ones. Coincidence or not, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, directed with maestry by Norman Jewison and starring Topol, in a joyous performance as Tevye, is about tradition.FIDDLER is about the fight between the traditional values and the new ones. But it's not just an uplifting story; it's bittersweet, even depressing at times. In fact, I like this film so much because I felt every kind of emotion while watching it: happiness, fun, excitement, sadness... It's a complete film, one that touches you deep inside.The cinematography is gorgeous, the visuals are great and the songs are excellent. I highly recommend this film. It closed the door for the old fashioned musicals, but it was time. Audiences needed something new, but the musical genre isn't a favorite nowadays. I hope that MOULIN ROUGE, the best movie of 2001 so far, opens the door for a new kind of musical."
"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is a magnificent film.It was nominated for Best Picture in 1971. The other nominees were: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW AND NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA. Academy voters shocked many of us by picking THE FRENCH CONNECTION. In my opinion, FIDDLER should have won.As I got older, I realized why FIDDLER ON THE ROOF lost the coveted Best Picture Oscar. It was too orthodox for the taste of the Academy voters. In addition, many of the voters could not bring themselves to vote for a picture where Tevye would never accept a gentile son-in-law despite the fact that Orthodox Judaism forbids interfaith marriages. The Jewish academy voters, many of whom are not religious at all, didn't want to be reminded of these prohibitions.What a great ensemble cast! Too bad that Norma Crane (nee Anna Bella Zuckerman) and Leonard Frey died at the peak of their careers.Topol gave a terrific performance and was Oscar nominated only to lose to fellow Jew Gene Hackman (THE FRENCH CONNECTION). Molly Picon, as Yenta, deserved a best supporting actress nod but did not get it. To me, Leonard Frey was a surprise Oscar nominee in the supporting category; whereas in the Golden Globe awards, Paul Mann, (who portrayed butcher Laser Wolf), got a supporting nod.The musical numbers are staged with grace. The wedding scene, where the awesome Sunrise, Sunset is performed, is memorable and poignant. The Russian dancing sequence, and Tevye singing If I were a rich man are done with finesse.As is depicted throughout Jewish life, the Jews have become wanderers but will never give up their heritage and musical traditions. Fiddler on the Roof does not foresake anything in providing great entertainment, much history and music that is forever etched into our hearts.Films like FIDDLER ON THE ROOF are terribly missed. ****"
"""Here in Anatevka, we have traditions for everything: how to sleep, how to eat, how to work, how to wear clothes. It's a tradition, and because of our traditions, every one of us knows who he is and what God expects him to do"" says Tevye (Topol), the Jewish village milkman in pre-revolutionary Russia. He believed that they were still God's chosen people, as God said in Exodus 19:5b (KJV), ""ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people."" A ""tradition"" purist, he, prejudiced against the foreign Russians as they intermingle with them in Anatevka, wishes to marry out his three older daughters.""But would it be heresy on my part to suggest that ""Fiddler"" isn't much as a musical, and that director Norman Jewison has made as good a film as can be made from a story that is quite simply boring?"" asks critic Roger Ebert. As much as I respect him, I disagree with him here. The story is not about marrying out his three daughters, but instead about Tevye's controversial decisions in those marriages that alter the Jewish life in their village. In the end, the Russians drive out these Jews in a pogrom; it is not a key point of the plot, but an indirect effect of the generations-long Jew discrimination. The truth that it teaches doesn't lie in the history, but perhaps in the way Tevye impacted Anatevka's history.Faithful to the Jewish traditions, Fiddler is an accurate portrayal of Jews that can both entertain and educate without stark preaching. Perhaps the greatest openly-Jewish/Christian movie made by mainstream Hollywood, it deals with the various differences in the peoples and the ignorance of Tevye of the outside world. But Fiddler doesn't preach; it presents the message throughout the entire film's two hours and fifty-nine minutes. The ""teachable"" moments don't come in one cheap, blink-and-you-miss-it line, but instead through Jewison's smooth storytelling and direction that sinks the message comfortably in.This gradual separation from tradition comes in the form of his daughters' husbands. First, instead of accepting the village matchmaker's choice of husbands, they love and know their selected mates, an alien concept to Tevye. Second, these desired husbands' ideas and positions push the borders of tradition one at a time, with the eldest marrying a tailor in the village, the second a Revolutionist and the third, a goy. Tevye, quickly though a bit reluctantly accepts the tailor, he is skeptical but consents to the Revolutionist, but he altogether rejects the goy. He feels the change happening. He can't avoid it, yet, at the same time, he still can't fully accept it. Based on the hit, still on-going Broadway musical, Fiddler won three Academy Awards for sound, the clever use of cinematography and John William's adaption of the score. The witty dialogue, catchy songs and the wise-guy Tevye brings the Jews back into an accepted light."
"Fiddler on the Roof is a solid musical and is actually a little better than I anticipated. Set in pre-revolutionary Russia, this film describes the life of Jewish peasantry and how their way of life faces off against more modern times. I found the movie to be quite a learning experience, as my knowledge of Russian history really begins at the Bolshevik takeover. This is the earliest film I remember seeing of legendary composer, John Williams. He does a magnificent job adapting the music from stage to screen. I loved some of the songs such as ""Tradition"" and ""If I was a rich man."" For the most part, I loved the choreography. However, I was oddly bothered at some of the dancing, especially from Topol's character. It just didn't seem to strike a chord with me. I loved the production design and the cinematography. Despite its advancing age, the film still looks beautiful.Norman Jewison's film is a musical that takes place in pre-revolutionary Russia. A country that is struggling to modernize itself. Perhaps some of the reason is the Jewish peasants, who believe in their traditions. Tevye is a milkman who is poor and lives with his wife and five daughters. As the matchmaker suggests matches for his eldest daughters, Tevye has to deal with changing ways of life as his family attempts to break tradition.If you want to see a popular film that has a no-name cast, don't look further than this film. Until my initial viewing of this film, I have never heard of anyone in this cast. But I feel they all do reasonably well in their roles. Topol does a good job as Tevye. He looks to be an old man, but he was only in his 30's when this film was released. His singing was pretty good too. The pain he shows as he realizes tradition is crumbling all around him is pretty darn heart-breaking. The rest of the cast features unknown names such as Norma Crane as Golde, Tevye's wife and Leonard Frey as Motel, a lover of Tevye's eldest daughter.Overall, Fiddler on the Roof is an often entertaining musical filled with excellent songs and a score that puts the majestic John Williams on the map. The choreography is hit or miss and the film feels a little stretched. But the film does a good job in portraying peasant life during Czarist Russia and how difficult life can be for them, and how tradition unites their people. The beginning and end shots are beautiful, and what gives this movie the title it has. They are my favorite shots of the movie.My Grade: B+"
"A tale worth knowing but it tests our patience.I got to know of this through a friend Abhijeet Kulkarni (a big fan of singer Kishore Kumar) who ""I like it because its my idols favorite movie"" and watched it nearly 3 years back for first time. When I revisited it now I am just all over in love with it for the first hour, the second hour seemed dragging and I had to sit through 3rd just to finish it. Over three hours long, this tale of a family of Tevye (playe by Topol) becomes too sardonic and too painful by the end. Had it been a tad shorter, it would have just right up there as a great movie. Now, still its definitely a good movie and worth watching for many reasons. Top most reason being there to see Topol playing Tevye, the family runner, a man for a family. Topol is just so fine and brings so much more to the character Tevye is that there is no escape form empathizing, falling in love with Tevye and embracing him for the way he dealt with his things. Setup in 1900's Russia, this is a tale of a family of Tevye who has 5 daughters and he has to get them married, now tradition is what he believes in sticks to and he has to fore go a few beliefs too for his own family and he does that too and becomes so very humane. Now, did I ever mention that its a musical and oh wow, the music is so good, 'Matchmaker' and 'Do you love me' are two songs that are my favorites and will listen them over again and again. John Williams for sure has produced a supreme soundtrack and worth a collection. So is the cinematography and art direction which are simply superb.Now, editing is not up to the mark and this being a musical I agree it has less scope and it needed a large landscape to take us and make us delve into the niceties of such place and also its grave atrocities. It's great if looked at as a play for its completely performance oriented but as a movie, I wish it was just shorter by say half an hour.It's 3/5 for a good movie and definitely worth a watch for TOPOL and surely thanks to Kishore da and Abhijeet for making me watch this."
"Why not watch this film with your children, discuss at the finish of it, watch the special features (on the re-released DVD), and then watch it again? The concepts, so brilliantly performed, provide an excellent opening for the teaching of values, principles, and morals. The story is based on factual situations and includes the opportunity to 'feel' life from a point of view so rarely practiced now. Do not deprive yourself, or your children, the chance to watch this film simply because of the setting--mankind deserves to be examined no matter the differences of the generation.For lovers of musicals, this is a film not to be missed! The lyrics provide additional storyline, as well as insight, to the plot. The masterfully composed tunes will stay in your mind to the point where you will find yourself humming selections from 'Fiddler' well after you've finished watching the movie.The serious tones of this story are well balanced with humour and music. Hollywood found the magic recipe of warmth and excitement in the production of this film; the richness of the human spirit is worth watching."
"I have seen this film several times on DVD in widescreen, which is the only way to see this film. It would be ruined cropped and 'Pan & Scanned.' Norman Jewison shows here that he truly has an eye for filming musicals. It's wonderfully edited as well.The film mixes humor, heavy drama, and sadness in the fate of some of it's characters, into a film that is truly riveting to watch. The musical score is wonderful, arranged and adapted to the screen by John Williams.This film was very popular when released to theaters, worldwide. It was a smash hit in Japan. One may find this odd, until you consider that the film is about the confrontations by old and young generations of matters of tradition. This is the soul of the film, and one of the reasons it played so well in so many countries. Everyone can relate to it's basic message.Jewison relates on the DVD how United Artists had pressured him to sign Zero Mostel for the role that Topal eventually got. Mostel was playing him on Broadway, and his performance was reportedly very good. But once Jewison saw Topal's performance on the London stage, he was convinced that he was the right man for the part. I must admit to agreeing with this, even though I'm a fan of Zero Mostel's work.The entire cast is good, and convincing in their roles. Jewison cast this film very carefully. Considering that it took 18 months to film, Norman Jewison was truly dedicated to this film. And it shows. I recommend this film most highly!"
