"Let me confess I'm not a Catholic, I don't have children, I can't stand schmaltz and yet I love The Sound Of Music. I've tried to explain this to myself, let alone to others, without ever finding a satisfactory answer. Yesterday I sat to see it again with a group of kids who hadn't seen it before. They all loved it even the ones who loved Transporters. I asked them afterwards why did they loved it so much and a 12 year old boy's reply was: ""It makes you feel alive"" Wow, I thought, Wow! Of course, that's what I felt too and a 12 year old found the perfect words to express my feelings. Julie Andrews is a the center of this little miracle. She is Sister Maria and her wishes, thoughts and fears are recognizable automatically, because they are, in many ways, my same wishes, thoughts and fears. Perfect. Thank you."
"Capitalizing on two ""hot"" properties of the early sixties, director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews, this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since, especially the sequences which feature the songs ""Do Re Mi"" (#88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time) through the streets of Salzburg and ""The Lonely Goatherd"", performed with puppets.These, among others, helped it capture the Best Picture Oscar that year over David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools (1965), A Thousand Clowns (1965), and Darling (1965), which (like Doctor Zhivago (1965), also) features Julie Christie, in her Oscar winning Best Actress performance. Wise, who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy, picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film; Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination (she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins (1964)).Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (and Maria von Trapp's novel), Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who, after their first public performance as a singing group, fled when Hitler annexed their country (the Anschluss) in March, 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria, with the help of a local priest (fashioned as Max Detweiler, played by Richard Haydn, in the film), had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length, the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers & Hammerstein songs (helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment) keep it from feeling overlong.In fact, it's the kind of film, like The Wizard of Oz (1939), that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is #10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time; ""My Favorite Things"" is #64. And no one can forget (how do you solve a problem like) ""Maria"", sung in part by Marni Nixon (known for dubbing Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I (1956), West Side Story (1961), and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively) in one of her only on-screen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""Edelweiss"" and ""So Long, Farewell"", especially little Kym Karath's ""goodbye"" in the reprise, as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes, and their just right lyrics, move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder ""when will it end?"". The film's Sound and Editing, as evidenced in the aforementioned ""Do Re Mi"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" numbers, also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she, and his children, had helped the Captain to rediscover song, love, and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous, the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta, who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond, Friedrich, also had a television career which included playing roles in several series, most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's (Louisa) TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's ""Sixteen going on Seventeen"". Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess (whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay) earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line ""Him?!"", after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the ""dueling"" Sisters, Margaretta and Berthe (Portia Nelson) who, despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun, work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt, the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness, who presumably doesn't sing or perform (she that forgot her harmonica), such ironic and fortunate casting! Also, Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly, uncredited, during the ""I Have Confidence"" number.The film's Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus, besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001, the film is #55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and #27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. #4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made, make it an annual tradition in yours!"
"I've grown up with every Female generation in my Family Singing these Songs, so it's surprising I've only just got round to watching this now. I had no idea this Movie was so Dark! Starting with the Joyful opening which slowly progresses to an unpredictable Sinister Storyline.This is Top Cinema at it's best!! The Costumes, The Settings, The Actors, The catchy Song writing all get Top Marks from me. I even found myself so engrossed and feeling anxious with sudden urges to shout at the Screen, especially near the End.I couldn't fault a thing! It's such a shame that modern Film makers seen to have lost the ability to write such Masterpieces anymore. A Brilliant Movie!!!"
"Song and dance is definitely not my thing. However I've seen this movie dozens and dozens of times overs the years. It never gets old... if you have never seen it it's well worth your time. They just don't make them like this anymore. Rent it or buy it, a true classic that is perfect from start to finish..."
"The Sound of Music (1965) is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music."
"While many people agree that the Sound of Music is one of the best films of all time, some are at a loss to adequately explain why; they buckle under and admit that there are parts that are syrupy, etc. Well, I'll tell you why it's the best movie ever (and I DON'T agree that it's too syrupy). It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It's not like today's movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. ""Good bye, Maria. I'm sure you'll make a fine nun.""  You want to smack her. Thirdly, it's got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it's great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it's got great music. Fifthy, it's got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? ""The Sound of Music"" does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.  It succeeds because it is a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, wonderfully-acted, brilliant movie.  For me, no other movie can compare.  Not to be obsessed with it or anything. :)"
"The Sound of Music, the sound of freedom.This classic film is filled with glorious songs and has plenty for hopeless romantics to enjoy. The Sound of Music also effectively works in the tension and foreboding of the time period. Everyone in Austria has to make a choice when the Nazis arrive. Even the nuns in the abbey must make a choice.It's worth discussing with older kids why this was such a tense time and why the Von Trapps made the painful decision to flee the country they loved. It is a movie of catching freedom.""The Sound of Music"" has contributed to the legend which has grown around the true life story of the Trapp family. ------Yidioo"
"Not many films can achieve the flat out beauty that you see in The Sound of Music. The mesmerizing European landscapes and Julie Andrews' voice, not to mention the cute performances by the children, especially in their goodbye song, make this film not only the best musical of all time, but one of the best films of all time.Yes, I did say best musical. Singin in the rain is sewer water compared to this. Not that Singin is a bad musical, but not as good. The Wizard of Oz is learning how to make fire, The Sound of music is inventing the Flying car. This film is timeless, beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting, but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough, for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside, saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind, and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this, but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds, and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy, and it is so beautiful, you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals, and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours. To simply conclude, you will never see a more heart-stopping beautiful movie in your life."
"The Sound Of Music is a musical film that was adapted on screen from the Broadway musical of the same name with the songs written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.It stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as Maria and Captain Georg von Trapp respectively together with Eleanor Parker as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder who was the Captain's lady friend and a competition for Maria;Richard Haydn as Max Detweiler, a good friend of both the Baroness and the Captain; as well as Charmian Carr,Nicholas Hammond,Heather Menzies,Duane Chase,Angela Cartwright,Debbie Turner and Kym Karath as the Von Trapp children.Robert Wise directed this classic musical film.It is about the story of the von Trapp family singers.Maria is a young woman who gets into the consternation of the nuns in an Austrian convent.This prompted Mother Abbess to send her to become a governess for the seven children of a naval officer and widower,Captain Georg von Trapp.It later leads a romance between Maria and the captain that leads to marriage.The children who happen to be talented singers also joins the Salzburg Music Festival during their honeymoon.It contains several popular songs, including ""Edelweiss"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""Do-Re- Mi"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"", ""The Lonely Goatherd"", and the title song, ""The Sound of Music"".It concludes when the von Trapp family escapes from Austria to Switzerland before the Germans annexes the country.It has been more than 50 years since the musical was released.Throughout all these years,it has remained popular.The songs would still provide delight to the viewers today and remains byword to many.The songs definitely provided a lot of joy and entertainment for they are definitely Rodgers and Hammerstein's best scores.But it is great to note how wonderful Julie Andrews was in it as Maria for she lights up the screen all throughout.She definitely can warm a lot of hearts throughout the generation when watching it.Aside from the songs,it also has everything that one wants to see in a movie like love;a love triangle between Maria,the Captain and the Baroness;children;great cinematography;great European locations;religion;comedy;war and intrigue. Overall,there is no question that this is one of the most enduring musical of all-time and it has timeless charm written over it."
"Watching my Mother dancing and singing to the songs of ""The Sound of Music"" at the age of five was incredibly disturbing. It was seven years before anyone was able to sit me down in front of the T.V to the musical during the annual telecast in Sydney. Almost to my horror, I was falling in love with the musical. More than two years later, not a single movie has been able to pass it in my favourite movies stakes. I have made judgemental mistakes with great movies. Greats like ""Casablanca"", ""The African Queen"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" have originally also been frowned upon. ""The Sound of Music"" expanded my horizons on the movie world. I eventually went on to view non-musical classics as a result of this single movie, and now old classic movies have become a genuine passion. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote their greatest work in the form of their last musical, despite the fact it was ""Carousel"" that was their favourite. Although the changes made from the original stage production have now been evident in the arrival of the excellent musical currently playing in Sydney, much have been for the better. Throughout their career, the duo created immortal musicals, but in story, song and film, ""The Sound of Music"" surpasses ""The King and I"", ""Oklahoma!"", ""Carousel"" and ""South Pacific"" in all aspects. We all know the story. We know of at least one of the immortal songs from the musical, ""The Sound of Music"", ""My Favourite Things"", ""Do-Re-Mi"" or ""Edelweiss"". Julie Andrews was believable and unforgettable as the sweet, outspoken novice nun turned governess, who should have taken out the oscar that year. Christopher Plummer was dashing as the Captain, and the supporting cast was one of the best I have ever seen. Fond memories have been remembered from some of the unforgettable sequences of this film that deservedly made it the best picture of 1965.Yes, there are sugary elements in the movie that cannot be denied. But this movie has never been reliant upon sex, violence or drugs to make it one of the best things to come out of Hollywood. It can be appreciated truly for what it is, pure art, talent and spirit. It is not a real perception of the world nowadays, but for all the joy it brings, who cares?It was the last movie I expected to love as a fourteen year old. It was also the first movie I watched in seven years that could manage to make me shed tears, and view it in loving admiration which cannot be equalled.
""Singin' In the Rain"" is the only other contender to the title of ""The greatest movie ever made"". Whatever its flaws, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of the worlds best loved treasures which keeps bringing generations of viewers to its attention.Rating: 10/10"
"This has to be the greatest musical of all time. An amazing musical score and stunning choreography, no home should be without a copy of this timeless classic.This musical is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages. A Happy family film with no sex, violence or bad language. The young actors playing the roles of the von Trapp children are amazing and Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime as Maria, a young Nun who becomes a cheerful governess.This is definately a family movie to be watched together on a Sunday Afternoon!!"
The whole world of films should depend and follow this one and only legendary drama movie ever made and I'm glad I got to watch it and one thing is absolutely certain that Julie Andrews was a heck of a lady when she was pretty and younger and it hurts that how time passes by and our legacies remain but us .
"I grew up admiring Maria Von Trapp. The joy their family had with 7 children. I'm sure it influenced me to want a large family as well.The integrity that everyone had in the family was incredible. I love any movie where the main man in the movie has principles and sticks to them. This one has principles and courage in spades.It's such a completely innocent movie with romance and love being the dominate themes in male/female relationships. This is not a movie in which lust plays any part.I love the gentle parenting it shows. I love the obedient children it shows.Talking points: Young love - does it often last? Who do you owe the most allegiance to, God of the government? Do we get blessings in life because of good behavior?"
"This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as ""Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?"" or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, ""If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you."" The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines (""Seven Brides..."", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""...Molly Brown"", ""The Music Man"", to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of ""The Sound of Music"". The film has it all."
"Has Julie Andrews ever appeared on film more beautifully than in this film? Has she ever sung with such richness and gusto as is captured here? As a big fan of hers, I can watch this musical over and over and just sigh.Wise and his cinematographer have photographed Andrews in a manner that no other director has--even her husband. Watch the scene where Maria watches the Captain sing Edelweiss with the kids. Wise turns her into a gauzy angel. It is a fantastic moment among hundreds that this movie contains.I am firmly in a camp that says Julie Andrews was completely, utterly, and regrettably robbed when the 1965 Oscars were handed out. She embodied Maria Von Trapp, wholly and with every fiber of her being (just watch the scene in which she races the boys in a segment of ""Do-Re-Mi""; she runs at the camera with utter abandon here, no holding back. Or consider the shot at the end of this song, where she places her hand atop her head--it's as if even SHE can't believe she's hitting that note).The Julie Christie performance that beat Andrews is now all but forgotton. ""The Sound of Music,"" however, lives on and on.""The Sound of Music"" is a bit bittersweet for me, given that audiences tastes would soon turn away from big-budget musicals in general and Julie Andrews specifically. But what a legacy it (and she) have left!"
"""The Happiest sound in all the world""? Quite possibly and easily the most famous musical film in Hollywood history. Most of us grown-ups still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year anymore). Julie Andrews takes her MARY POPPINS success and adds even more to it with her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin originated on the Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could. In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, Martin was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage version and Andrews was 30 when the transition came to film came around--a perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented: Christopher Plummer in the role he will be forever remembered for (even though he hated the part) is an achingly true Cap. Von Trapp with those ""hidden talents"" making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a comical and yet sincere ""Uncle"" Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our perrenial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as well (esp. the opening scenes which is probably the most beautiful aerial shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public Austrian gardens during the DO-RE-MI sequence). So let's all keep watching this most cherished of all musical films each year and never forget it's universal sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'."
"If ""West Side Story"" was the best musical film of the sixties, then ""The Sound of Music,"" adapted from the long-running Broadway musical play about Maria Von Trapp and her singing family, was certainly the most popular With a story that includes the right amount of family sentiment (the Von Trapp children never quarrel among themselves), religion (in the Hollywood tradition of serene, kind nuns), romance (actually two romances, one adult, one adolescent), and anti-Nazi feeling (Captain Von Trapp refuses to surrender to the Nazi invaders)and with director Robert Wise who is in fact a solid, conscientious craftsman and a fluent story-teller mercifully free of grandiose pretensions, ""The Sound of Music"" is perfect with its sumptuous location photography, immaculate, fluid editing, and splendid tones The film does have a justifiably famous opening: the camera sweeps over the Austrian Alps to catch Julie Andrews, as mischievous, warmhearted Maria, exultantly singing the title song as she rushes through the bright green valley It is an exhilarating moment that the film never really matches again, but there is plenty left in the remaining hours to please the legions of devotees...There are unquestionably some enjoyable songs and musical numbers specially when the eldest Von Trapp daughter (Charmian Carr) meets her shy beau (Daniel Truhitte) in the family garden, he sings ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" to her, and they do a charming little dance around the gazebo Maria's music lesson to the children, ""Do-Re-Mi,"" is beautifully staged, set over several days as they amble in and around Salzburg, changing their clothing through camera wizardry And perhaps the best of the songs is the simplest, ""Edelweiss,"" with a tender lyric and poignant melody that make a fitting last song for Rodgers and HammersteinAnother of the film's virtues is Julie Andrew's performance as Maria... She cuts through the thick sentiment with her own sharply honed blade of authority and self-confidence, implying that at least she will get through all the high corn without damaging her self-esteem... It works to balance the tight-lipped stodginess of Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the ""adorable"" posturings of the children, and the artificial airs of Eleanor Parker as the haughty baroness..."
"One of my all-time favorite movies.  It might be on the sweet side, but sometimes that's just exactly what is needed.  Anyway, there is Christopher Plummer as the captain to balance out all that sweetness.  I always thought he had a great voice and terrific screen presence in this film.Julie Andrews at her freshest and best...her singing is wonderful, the alps are wonderful, the songs are memorable, and the story line never gets boring."
"1965's ""The Sound of Music"" is everything a bad musical should be. Providing more sap than a forest full of Vermont maples, it has coy, silly songs, an inane, innocuous script, and unbelievably sugary characters.  So why is it one of my favorite musicals?  OK, go ahead.  Shoot me at twenty paces.  But after all this time, it still remains a guilty pleasure.  I find myself going for a tub of rocky road ice cream and Rodgers & Hammerstein's immortal classic whenever the real world gets to be too much.  I seem to play it a lot around tax time.And I'm not alone.  Why is it still considered the most popular musical of all time?  Well, first of all they spared no expense.  The extremely well-produced blockbuster has gorgeous, eye-popping scenery.  From the first moment Julie Andrews flails her arms and circles around on that beautiful sunny hillside singing the rousing title song, I know I'm being swept away to another world.  I'm not in Kansas anymore...or L.A., anyway.  The panoramic Salzburg background complements and never intimidates or takes away from the characters or their story (like the other R & H extravaganza ""South Pacific."")  That in itself is an incredible feat.Now about those songs.  Almost every one of them is absolute drivel.  So what makes them work?  Easy.  The utter joy and sincerity of the cast who sings the infectious, hummable tunes, which are backed by  extremely moving orchestrations and an exceptionally beautiful score.  It's hard to resist Maria prancing about, pillow-fighting with a bunch of knee-highs and gushing about her most favorite things.  Or the austere Captain Von Trapp (the meticulous Christopher Plummer) turning to butter after hearing his brood sing in perfect harmony for the first time (with no prior lessons even) and joining right in.  Or the Mother Superior's soaring number that unknowingly forewarns Maria to head for the hills (I mean, mountains) before the Nazis escort them elsewhere.  Or the 16-year-old going on 17 squealing with delight after receiving her first kiss.  Or the kids working up a clever little ditty to leave their formal party guests when its time for bed.  Or two people declaring their love in a moonlit gazebo.  The songs work because they come straight from and aim for the heart, not the head, which is exactly the place the viewer should be coming from when watching this movie. If the songs don't transcend the script (which they didn't prior to the 70s), they certainly transcend the mood.The script is undeniably trite and probably the film's weakest link.  But again, the characters play it straight all the way.  Not one actor looks embarrassed.  Every scene is done with total enthusiasm and total commitment, and the performers who are telling the story are pitch-perfect and picture perfect. And as for the characters.  Try and think of anybody better than jubilant, crop-haired Julie Andrews as a postulant nun who has gorgeous pipes, can make play clothes out of curtains, can set up and operate marionette shows at the drop of a hat, and is confident enough to convince a man that a failed nun is ideal marriage material.  I certainly can't.  Thank heavens for her Oscar-winning ""Mary Poppins"" the year before or we might have gotten Julie LONDON instead!  After all, Andrews did lose out on ""My Fair Lady"" the year before.  But now  certifiably bankable, she proved she could handle this dream role.  Andrews is cutely silly, cutely stubborn, cutely astute, cutely shattered and cutely...well, cute.  She gives the most wholesomely appealing musical perf since Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  To actually make you forget Mary Martin in the Broadway role takes some doing and she does it effortlessly.  Christopher Plummer is all seriousness, handsomely patrician, and quite a catch for anybody...much less a nun.  I can't think of anyone more suitable for this role either.  As for the Seven Little Foys, I mean the Von Trapp children, they are adorable and perfect in their own ways too, whether they are marching or singing,  creating their own individual personalities by film's end.Richard Haydn as Max and Eleanor Parker as the flamboyant, haughty Baroness provide wonderful catty relief.  Despite having their musical numbers snatched away from them, they make up for it with droll, sophisticated humor.  The elegant, perfectly coiffed Parker is particularly delicious as Maria's chief romantic rival, getting some of the film's best zingers and delivering them with biting understatement.  Parker developed a devout cult following after this role.  Peggy Wood's Mother Superior is suitably reverent and inspiring.For those who tear ""The Sound of Music"" apart for its shameless, sugar-coated manipulations, well, I can respect that.  But to attack it for its political and historical inaccuracies is like attacking ""Peter Pan"" for being a subversive plot that encourages young children to run away from home.  It's ludicrous.  Despite the fact that it's based on a true story, we're not watching ""The Sound of Music"" for stark realism.  Like a sparkling and lavish Ernst Lubitsch operetta, we want a feel-good movie, with feel-good songs, with a feel-good story, and a feel-good ending.  Nothing more.  If you want a movie that presents a potent depiction of pre-war Austria or anti-Nazi sentiment, rent ""Holocaust"" or ""Schindler's List."" Here, we want to believe that a group of nuns can tear out an automobile carburetor and save the world!  Period.I suppose the reality-based MTV generation cannot truly respect or relate to the relative innocence and pure escapism like ""The Sound of Music.""  If this movie was made today I'm afraid the Von Trapp children would not be dangling out of trees for fear of drive-by shooters.  It's a tough new world today, sad to say.  The 50s and 60s are looking better all the time.Anyway, for what it's worth, ""The Sound of Music"" is indeed schmaltz, but its QUALITY schmaltz at its very, very best."
"In thinking of The Sound of Music, one of the first things that comes to your mind might be soundtracks like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss, ""So Long, Farewell"". The Sound Of Music did not only win the best original score, but along another nine academy awards. Best Picture, Best director, Best film editing, Best sound mixing, Best actress, Best supporting actress, Best cinematography, Best costume design, Best production design. 
The Sound of Music might be the most perceptible work of Robert Rise, Time Magazine described it as 'most popular attraction in the first half-century of the Hollywood feature film'. The justification is considerable. This movie does not forms part of this generation's childhood memories, but also brings fond memories for older generations. According to Sound Of Music Companion The story is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp Family singers. Originated in 1926 - Austria, Maria(Julie Andrews) arrived at the Trapp family as a private tutor for the family of 10 after leaving Nonnberg Abbey. She gradually got the children immersed into music and enticed them to sing but faced opposition from Baron Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) , their father. After Maria was sent back and forth from the Abbey, the father of 10 eventually had fallen in love with Maria and married her. The movie ends with the family fleeing when Hitler annexed their country, after participating in the Salzburg Festival Singing Competition. Sound wise, the original score from The Sound Of Music, might be the best film music soundtrack in cinema history. The songs ""My Favourite Thing""and ""Do Re Mi"" is still ranked 66 and 88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time respectively .( AFI, no date) The composer Irwin Kostal has achieved his second academy award from the timeless classic film after Mary 
Poppins.(IMDb, no date) The song composed by the 'Disney Legend' is not only heart warming, but also enabled us to be fully engaged to the angel voices of the actors and actresses. 
The characters may be portrayed through the songs lyrics and melody. The Telegraph UK describes the voice of the cast as ' clear as a mountain stream and as pure as an angel ' . Besides, the cinematography of the The Sound Of Music is also notable : the infamous opening scene of the camera sweeping across the Austrian Alps to catch Maria singing title song as she is running through the bright green grassland is an example. The tone and mood of the movie may also be portrayed through different shots, especially the ending aerial shot with the Trapp family crossing the green hills to escape from Nazis with the song 'Climb Over Mountain' in the background. Matching the phenomenal shots, music and choreography together, The Sound of Music indisputably is a spectacular classical musical film."
"""The Sound of Music"" is an impressive musical that stands above other films of the genre because of interesting characters, top-notch direction, and a truly inspired screenplay.  Julie Andrews (Oscar-nominated) stars as the young nun who leaves the convent to become the governess to a large family. She is instantly at odds with the children's father (Christopher Plummer), but they soon fall in love and get married.  However, evil forces lurk overhead as the Nazis invade their homeland of Austria.  Somewhat based on a true story, ""The Sound of Music"" is one of those rare musicals that works because there is a sense of fear and drama in the film's final act.  This makes the film believable and none of the musical numbers take away from the story or the film's direction.  5 stars out of 5."
"THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a music romantic drama film which, through melodic and sentimental story, shows us a rhapsodic family. The film is an adaptation of the 1959 Broadway musical of the same name. The opening sequence is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. A charming scenery, with the musical score, is the biggest asset of this film.The Sound of Music is based on the true story of the Trapp Family Singers. Maria is a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing and enjoy in nature. Her imagination and lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and harsh with his children. A young nun wants to change the condition in the house and returns a smile on the face of children, however, she falls into a sweetest life trap ...A fictional reality flashing on all sides. Simply, it is hard to make sense. A warm and colorful family story is out of control. There are funny nuns, rich man with two faces, modest Baroness and an interesting fraud. A delicious lie in which song makes dreams come true.Julie Andrews as Maria is ""mischievous"" nun full of enthusiasm and energy. Her character is attractive and lively while she sings. However, what is worse, she becomes an uninteresting character in the second part of the film, because she could not bring their feelings in a pale romance. Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp is a firm hand, which quickly opens and turns into a frivolous grimace.Richard Haydn as Max Detweiler is a harmless impostor who sees all and slyly silent. Eleanor Parker as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder is a nice and fragile character. The children are very entertaining.No matter what, if you like to sing and dance in a quiet night, this is the movie for you."
"Sound of Music is one of the best musicals of all time displaying one of the greatest voices to ever be heard on the silver screen: Julie Andrews. What a wonderful movie that not only I grew up with but still treasure to this day. Sound of Music has everything you could ask for: romance, humor, singing, dancing and a wonderful cast that put their heart and soul into this film. All the songs are recognizable, although I admit that still hearing ""Few Favorite Things"" is strange during Christmas time. But moving on, Sound of Music is a classic film that is still incredible to watch and I always enjoy slipping into my DVD player to this day.Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior sends her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp. Arriving at the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the children, especially oldest daughter Liesl, who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf. As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness. But the children insist that Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the song ""Something Good."" Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has been indoctrinated in the ""glories"" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.Julie Andrews had come off fresh from Mary Poppins, which her character wasn't that far from being the nanny caring for children with a stuffy father. But the thing that made this film so special is that you honestly feel the love between Maria and Von Trapp, what a wonderful love story they had. The film is a bit long, but back in the day they had intermissions and oh, boy do I miss that. Come on, Lord of the Rings could have used one of those lol. Back onto Sound of Music, my favorite song is probably ""Confidence in Me"", such life to it due to Julie's beautiful voice and her dancing along the sidewalk could make anyone want to do the same thing. I love The Sound of Music, my boyfriend who hates musicals and said this was the crown of the worst, I asked him to watch it with me to see if he would give it another chance, I glanced over to see him singing a little to the songs! He finally admitted that the songs are very catchy, so see? You can find any little positive thing to say about this film, The Sound of Music brings you to life and you can't help but fall in love with this spectacular musical.10/10"
...EVER! Brilliant music. Amazing scenery Score. Script. Brilliant.
"A great musical with beautiful songs! Julie Andrews is a fantastic singer and actor, and it is fun to see her in her younger years. I don't believe the film would be as good without her, she is perfectly suited to the role. Most of the child acting is decent, which can usually really impact a film.The songs are absolutely classics and for a good reason. All further the story and fit, and they must have great song writers. Also, the settings are phenomenal with the mountain being iconic scenery now. Costumes are very nice, and reflect the mood of the scenes. However, the cinematography is basic but I think it is mainly due to the time period and equipment. Just overall an amazing classic that everyone has watched or needs to!"
"Based on a real life story. This takes place in Salzburg, Austria in 1939. Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs a governess to help control his seven children whose mother has died. The captain is VERY stern and treats his children like slaves. Maria (Julie Andrews) a nun is hired for the job. She quickly tames the children and has them singing. She even gets through to the captain. However he is engaged to be married to an evil Baroness (Eleanor Parker) who just wants him for his money.Beautiful scenery, great songs and a wonderful performance by Andrews. Sure it's syrupy and TOO sweet but I find it irresistible. The three hours just fly by whenever I see it. Andrews is wonderful and all the kids are OK. Parker does what she can in the evil woman role. The only real debit here is Plummer. He didn't want to do it and that comes through loud and clear. He called it ""The Sound of Mucus"" and complained about his singing voice being dubbed. So his performance is bad but it doesn't ruin the movie.All in all I LOVE this movie and heartily recommend it. Best part: Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess belting out ""Climb Every Mountain""."
"The Sound of Music (1965)For all the liberties made to historical accuracy, I think it goes without saying, a movie is being made, and without certain poetic license, the bird of genius cannot fly, so leeway must be given... and in so doing here, a truly important and beautiful result is made. Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) stone intensity as a disciplinarian who has forgotten how to love, who has lost his inner music after the death of his wife, is softened and freed through the inspiring lightness of Maria's (Julie Andrews) enchanting entrance into he and his seven children's life as the house's new Governess... While the leads balance each other, the sweetness of the music is equally balanced by the sobriety of the situation in which they find themselves, during the Nazi occupation of Austria. What intrigues me is that in the song ""16 Going on 17"" the young boy Rolf who appears to be in love with Leisl warns her of being seduced by men, but in the end it is he who is seduced, by the Nazis... and it is so often the case in life that while teaching others we grow cocky and forget that we too are still students, and capable of falling prey to our own folly... We also must understand though, even as the Von Trapp family escapes over the Alps to Freedom (the truth is they fled by train during the day to Italy), that those who helped them may not get off so lightly even though it is unshown in the film... the nuns who would obviously be recognized as having helped them by removing the car's carburetor, the man at the festival would likely be found complicit in helping them escape, and I mention them because it is impossible not to think of those who gave their lives to help so many escape the Nazis tyranny, and now it is our turn to help new refugees escape tyranny... the more that things change, the more they stay the same... I am an emotional person, and connecting emotionally with characters does help enjoyment, but also confirms bias and dilutes objectivity for sure... but ultimately, I believe The Sound of Music earns all five of its Oscars.The Amazon film ends with a one-hour behind the scenes look into the film and the Von Trapp family hosted by Julie Andrews. A perfect way to end the film.And like Maria, like Julie Andrews, my life is truly eased through singing my music, so perhaps as a singer, as a Jew, I relate quite intimately with the story.And it is true as is sung in the movie, and I leave you with that idea now... ""My heart will be blessed with the sound of music. And I'll sing once more."""
"The Sound of Music is my most favourite movie ever! I know all the songs and all the dialogue. I watch it at least once a week. I told a guy at my school to watch it (well I kind of forced him to!) and now he can play the backing music of all the songs on the piano! I always make him play them so I can sing along with them! Recently I was on a choir trip and the night we won, we were in the dining room and I started singing Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I got everyone to join in! We ended up singing the entire score, it was so fun! I got so into it I ended up standing on the table and there are some really embarrassing photos of me, but it was worth if because everyone had a great time. My friend bought me a Sound of Music bag for my birthday, it had a really cool picture on it and it is my FAVOURITE bag!!! I would recommend the movie to anyone because it is FANTASTIC!!!!!"
"I have seen this movie just 1 time , yesterday , and i am falling in love with this very romantic , funny , lovely film . Yeah i am still 14 , and i have knew this film before i saw it from my mom , and when she told me about it , i really want to saw it and finally i can saw it because one TV station perform it as special program! i am so happy . and i hope i can saw it again.i love every act about Maria and the captain  , it was so romantic , especially , the gazebo one and also the dance ! I like Maria's nice and funny character."
"Every bit the classic it is made out to be. I am not a fan of musicals, but this is great. The scenes flow into the music seamlessly and perfectly. Just about every song sticks pleasantly in your head. Plot is fairly basic, but good. Direction by Robert Wise is spot-on. Cinematography is spectacular. The Austrian mountainscapes are amazingly beautiful and provide the perfect backdrop.Performances by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great. The kids are mostly unconvincing and overly sweet though.A movie everyone should watch."
"'The Sound Of Music' is my favourite film and musical ever! Once you hear the songs, you'll be singing them for the rest of the day. The songs are unforgettable and just amazing! I love having lots of children in the film as well and having them singing, because most big hit films only include adults, or adults and a couple of children. It's nice for that element. Little Gretl and Marta are so sweet to watch, and one day I dream of being Liesl and performing her role. The film has been an inspiration for me since I was a very little girl, and i hope to fulfill my ambitions of starring in a staged production of 'The Sound Of Music'. I love the film and I will always love it! The dancing, acting and singing inspires me!"
"The Sound of Music, Bob Wise's adaptation of the Rogers and Hammerstein musical, is so beloved, and has been for so long, that it almost seems wrong to look at it with a critical eye. It's not so much a movie as it is a cultural monument. But forget the monumental money it grossed, or the Oscars it won. There's something about The Sound of Music that cuts through the critical divide. I love this movie. No, it's not that I simply think it is an exceptionally well-crafted piece of family entertainment. I do, but unlike almost any other film I've seen, The Sound of Music makes me feel something like real, genuine love. When Julie Andrews sings, my heart swoons.Based loosely on the true story of the Von Trapps, and the stage musical that came from their remarkable exploits in Austria in the late 1930s, The Sound of Music is primarily a tale of family. For those few who haven't seen it, the story centers on the Von Trapp patriarch (Christopher Plummer), and Julie Andrews' nun-turned-governess Maria, as she teaches the family music, and brings life back into the Von Trapp home. The plot takes on a richly un-purposeful quality. Maria's connection with the Von Trapp children is the main thread through the picture, and it is given ample room to breathe and grow. Intimate as it is, the film's story of the Von Trapps' gradual shift from a strict and regimented household to a place of warmth and love, actually has something of an epic reach. At 3 hours long, including intermission, The Sound of Music is set against the rise of Nazi Germany. That length and historical reach, however, is not all that makes The Sound of Music feel epic.The film benefits immensely from its locations. Salzburg is given the spotlight, and it is appropriately majestic. Framed against those famous Alps, the city is, pardon the cliché, a character unto itself. The Sound of Music does one thing that seems so simple, and yet very few movies achieve. It creates a tangible sense of place from its opulent sets and exquisitely photographed exteriors. Simply looking nice is not enough to give the audience the type of experience Bob Wise's production does. This is a patient film, one that savors its spectacular settings, immersing rather than just showing.And it is also patient with its characters, even more to its benefit. We are allowed to live with the Von Trapps, and really get to know the Von Trapp children, all well-cast and played. The familial relationships are built naturally over time. The meandering quality of the story is an asset. It's not a film where every scene counts, where every beat moves the story forward. It would be a lesser film if it was. Instead, The Sound of Music spends time with ""meaningless"" scenes. A frolic in the hills, impromptu musical numbers (The Lonely Goatherd puppet show is a totally unnecessary, but absolutely delightful interlude), and outings that convey only the remarkable charm of the actors and the splendid beauty of Austria. Part of the movie's success rests on our connection to these characters. Mercifully, nothing is rushed. These people make fabulous company, and the acting only makes our hearts grow fonder.As stated before, the Von Trapp children are genuinely charming, never falling victim to the sugary artificiality that plagues many child actors. The supporting characters, including Eleanor Parker as The Baroness, strike the same note, colorful but not overbearing. Christopher Plummer is invaluable as the film's straight man. A rigid drill sergeant who gradually discovers love again, he provides the movie's most potent emotional beats. But I'm burying the lead. Julie Andrews is miraculous in the lead role. Maria is a more understated take on her Oscar-winning Mary Poppins, but Andrews is just as vivacious here. It's hard to play motherly, lovable, or fun. If you don't have a natural effervescence, the audience will reject it. Julie Andrews has it in every fiber of her being. Her performance is a tour de force. The film is about bringing life and love to a family that needs it. Andrews' performance does just that. She brings no less than life itself to the screen whenever she is on it. Along with her classically beautiful singing voice, Andrews' presence is uncommonly memorable. More so than perhaps any other movie character, I felt as if I myself had fallen in love with Maria. Julie Andrews is just that good.All this is in service to the film's outstanding soundtrack. The songs are classics, we know them all by heart, even if we haven't seen the film. In the vein of the rest of the film, the music is bubbly and lovable. For me, the standout numbers are ""Do-Re-Mi"", with it's catchy lyrics and gorgeous montage of Salzburg locations, and ""I Have Confidence"", a new song that showcases Julie Andrews at her most girlishly buoyant. Even the smaller songs work their magic in context. The patriotic folk song, ""Edelweiss"", written by Rogers and Hammerstein specifically for the musical, is given a rousing rendition late, as is the titular song, ""The Sound of Music"", in a poignant scene halfway through the film. They're not all gold, but the songs in The Sound of Music are a class above most movie musicals.The Sound of Music succeeds on terms that we don't often think to evaluate movies on. It is lovable to an extreme, not concerned with the strength of its script, but with the charm of its actors, the quality of its locations, and the sound of its music. Bob Wise's direction, as technically accomplished as it is, is not as important as the intangible spark of magic in Julie Andrews' eyes. The breathtaking cinematography is great, but what makes The Sound of Music truly special is the sense of family, and the love we have for them. It's hard to evaluate The Sound of Music critically, because its greatness extends beyond critical evaluation. I fell in love with this film, and like the real deal, I'll never be able to fully explain why.94/100"
"Who said that schmaltz was such a bad thing? In the world of film, too much of schmaltz or saccharine is often viewed in a negative light. In 1965's The Sound of Music, the film is practically running with sentimental/saccharine feelings.....and I love the movie every bit for that. This movie is viewed as the best musical of all time, and I can agree to that statement. The word that can describe the movie is joy. From the moment Julie Andrews popped on screen, waving her arms in the air against the beautiful mountain background and beginning the title song, a smile creeped upon my face and it stayed there for two hours and fifty-two minutes. The joy is infectious and each character has a sense of happiness despite the Nazis lurking in the background. This is the type of musical you'll remember forever. I saw this movie once as a child and twenty years later, was able to sing along to such joyful songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"", ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Edelweiss"", ""So Long, Farewell,"" and of course, ""The Sound of Music."" With all these songs, composed by the brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein, the movie moved with a brisk pace despite the running time and left an imprint on all musicals to come.The movie is loosely based on the true story of Maria Von Trapp, and I emphasize the word loosely. Many historical facts were changed for dramatic purposes and director Robert Wise made a trip to see Maria to tell her this movie is not a biography and will be the better for it. From the memoir that was published in 1949, the famed Broadway show opened in 1959 and ran for three and a half years being a huge hit with fans and critics alike. Ernest Lehman was hired to write the screenplay, Robert Wise to direct, and the rest is history. Some may find Lehman's script to be compared with dripping maple syrup from the Vermont woods or Wise's direction to be corny, but I think they were perfect for the film.In 1930's Austria before the onset of Anchluss, there is a young woman named Maria (Julie Andrews) who works as a nun but is clearly not the type of woman for that profession. A Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) seeks a governess to care for his seven children. Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) convinces Maria to take the job. Von Trapp runs a tight ship and the children show their unhappiness by driving away their previous governesses. However, Maria is able to warm up to the children by showing them love and the joy of music. More to that, Georg and Maria begin to fall for each other despite the postulant nature of Maria's and Georg's engagement to a baroness (Eleanor Parker). But world events may soon run its course. Nazi Germany is about to annex Austria and Von Trapp may be needed to commandeer the German Navy's ships.The joy shown throughout the film is seen through the performances of nearly every character. If you thought Julie Andrews signature role was 1964's Mary Poppins, guess again. She was fantastic in that movie and that magical role is what gave her this role as Maria, but really transcends herself. From the start to finish, you are in complete awe of her. The joy she brings to Maria and her voice is powerful. I said many good things about Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago, but I think Andrews should have won on second watch. Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is also great. He was a veteran Broadway performer, but his performance as Georg Von Trapp introduced him to the world of movies. The seven Von Trapp children were all surprisingly good, although it's a shame none of them would go on to have distinguished or lengthy careers, but at least we have them to remember with these iconic roles. My favorite child is the eldest child, Liesel played wonderfully by Charmaine Carr. She brought a realistic vibe of finding love. Just listen to her beautiful rendition of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen.""I was really impressed with The Sound of Music. It impressed audiences in 1965, and it still impresses people in 2018. In the world of negativity, this is the kind of movie we need. The movie has the ability to put a smile on a person's face through music or through love. Schmaltz is oozing from these songs, but in a great way. All because there is joy to be seen and heard. Julie Andrews is the heart and soul of the movie, and it's her magnificent role that drives the film. In addition to the music, the Austrian views are breathtaking and they also add to the joy of the film. If you like musicals, or films in general, check out The Sound of Music.My Grade: A"
"A spirited nun leaves her convent and becomes a governess in pre-war Austria. Here she teaches the six children about love, life and music against the growing threat of Nazism.Your fingers hesitate on the keyboard before making comment on a film that is more a phenomena than a stretch of celluloid. This wasn't just a smash hit in the normal western markets - it also went huge everywhere and has stayed huge. The whole Indian film industry is descended from the template set down here.While this was a well regarded stage musical, this wasn't seen as a natural box office smash (a musical based on the life of a nun!) and was probably thrown to Robert Wise (more an action - than a music - man) because he was known for being able to operate well on a budget (all those B pics!)It was just as well, production was hellish: They had forgotten (didn't know?) how moody the European weather could be (even in Summer) and the genuine Austrian period folk songs didn't shine (new ones were quickly written); and beyond that many of the children had no real film acting experience.The success of the film is nothing but a bag of paradoxes, the must striking being that is was old fashioned even when it was released. Beat based pop music was dominating the sales charts and the sixties were beginning to swing. Hem lines were going up hair lines were going down and James Bond had already introduced casual sex and violence to the screen.This may have been made in 1965 - but it could easily have been made 20 years earlier and is the (off-screen) product of people that probably were coming to the end of their best creative period. Oscar and Hammerstein had already penned most of their famous musicals and must have been amazed that they struck their largest gold reserve so late in the day.As Noel Coward once observed, the one thing that critics overlook is that the public are looking for simple minded entertainment, not messages or meaning. And this is both simple minded and entertaining (if you can live with heavy schmaltz). There are certainly no messages, unless you need to be told that love and music are good and Nazi take-overs are bad!The songs don't so much act as light relief, but provide the film with a life support machine. As drama the whole thing can't get out of second gear - even the Nazi threat doesn't raise the drama level beyond village theatre. I also guess we are supposed to know what these people really represent from other sources?Julie Andrews performance is massively underrated. Here is someone that has to sing, dance and act with children (sometimes all at the same time!) and yet makes it look easy, natural and spontaneous. When has, say, Robert De Niro ever done anything as technically difficult as this?In many ways SOM is bullet proof (can you imagine Mel Brooks/Jerry Zucker doing a spoof?) family entertainment. A plot everyone can follow, charming children, excellent score, pretty scenery, perfect lead and a happy ending - if not for the rest of war torn Europe!As a footnote. Twentieth Century Fox lost all the profits they made on this film on musical follow ups that included Hello Dolly, Star and Dr Dolittle - which makes clear that the whole thing was, indeed, just a giant happy accident and musicals were not what the audience secretly wanted all along."
"I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin, her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point. The production was good, but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen. I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain.The main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role. With the casting of Ms. Parker, a talented player but no singer, certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated. Eleanor is fine in her role, but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally. On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe.Julie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen, gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else. There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play, but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway. Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice. I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes.Christopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career. I've always felt that the talented Mr. Plummer has never been given the credit due him. He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film. I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously. I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks/Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment.A real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant. Ms. Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, and Noel Coward. You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you. And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time.The charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys. The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss. Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for. The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany. Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would.The Sound of Music, it's story, it's music, it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings."
"The ""Sound of Music"" is set in the mountainous hills and the city of Salzburg, Austria. There is to my eye at least, something about its spacious alpine countryside which dominates and informs the entire production. The air, the light, the music, the styles of dress, the activities--everything is ""elevated"", with hardly anything being sea-level about it. And the film has a very good ""engagement sequence"" at the opening, when we learn about the central ethical character and experience her leaving the abbey where she has served along with her, and begin to care about her purposes. The story-line is simple and relatively direct: A young nun, unsuited to the profession, takes a job as a governess to the children of a difficult client--a captain in the Austrian navy who runs the household like a ship's company of sailors, complete with a bosun's whistle and a lineup of the children in matching uniforms. The body of the piece is then concerned with Maria, the governess, subverting the household and winning over the Captain until he gives up his present lady friend, a Baroness; then when Maria, who has been falling in love with him, goes away and comes back, he has to tell her he is in love with her also. They marry, to the children's delight in a great ceremony in a rebuilt replica of Salzburg's cathedral; but a Nazi Parrty official has words with the Captain. The family, against the Captain's former feeling, then enters the Sazlburg musical festival as the Von Trapp Family singers, something he had earlier opposed; and, winning the contest, they flee and are helped at her old abbey by Maria's Prioress and her friends there. The nuns sabotage the Nazis' cars by stealing parts, and Captain Von Trapp leads his family up over the mountain pass to freedom as the film ends. This happy film is filled with tuneful songs ranging from the ultra-simple ""Eidelweiss"" ballad to ""How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria"" , ""Do Re Mi"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""I Have Confidence"", ""The Lonely Goatherd"", ""Something Good"", ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" and the voice-challenging ""Climb Every Mountain"". Robert Wise directed this complex film, which features many sorts of scenes. Everything to me looks clean, bright and, frequently, even Austrian. Ernerst Lehman wrote the screenplay from the Broadway ""book"" by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse that borrowed its fictionalized biography from Maria Augusta Trapp's autobiographical work; Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II supplied the music and lyrics. Ted McCord provided lucid cinematography, with the production being designed by Boris Leven. Ruby R. Leavitt and Walter M. Scott did the complex set decorations while famous Dorothy Jeakins created the many vivid costumes. In the large cast, Julie Andrews was a charming Maria, though she was not particularly Austrian. Christopher Plummer had some very good moments as the Captain, Eleanor Parker played the Baroness with great skill and Richard Haydn was the Captain's impresario friend, Max. Ben Wright was the Nazu gauleiter, Peggy Wood the Mother Superior, and among the nuns were Anna Lee, voice-dubbing soprano Marni Nixon, Evadne Baker and Portia Nelson., In the cast also were Daniel Truhitte, Norma Varden, Gilchrist Stuart as Franz the butler, with the children Charmian Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Angela Cartwright, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Debbie Turner, and Kym Karath. It is a bit difficult for me as a writer to account for the highly-positive qualities of the film, since in my judgment they exceed the sum of the film's parts. The characters and relationships seem real to the viewer, I suggest, because we discover them along with Maria; her personal dilemmas are interesting, and the use of the Nazi Anschluss as a threat, a problem for the Captain, and a dark cloud hanging over the sunlit lives of the folk in the film works very well. The contrast for instance between the nuns' early disagreement over Maria's character and their helping to thwart the Nazis pursuing the family at the film's climax becomes a highly-symbolic movement; and like the growing love between Maria and the Captain and the children's being won over by their new governess, because the movement again is allowed to develop by slow stages, the satire-level comedy with its touch of drama works powerfully on an audience. There is much to be admired in the simplicity and the beautiful imagery of this film; if it is not an artistic masterpiece, it is frequently absorbing, moving and unaffected all at the same time."
"When I was an exchange student in the USA many years ago, my host-father showed me this film as being his favorite movie which he has seen in the cinema many times when it came out and still watches regularly ever since. I had never heard of that movie and since I am quite fond of musicals, I gave it a try.Now, I dearly love my host-father, but I really hate this movie. I have seen it twice so far, once with him to get to know it and once a few months ago when it was shown on German TV for the first time (!!). But the second time I only watched it to play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with some of my friends.The reason why this movie had never been shown on German TV before was because the German language track had been lost for many years and was only rediscovered by accident a while ago. But why did nobody in the German speaking region care to find the language track of this much beloved movie earlier? The main reason is that this movie, though it may have been successful in most parts of the world, was not so in Germany, Austria or Switzerland - and for good reason.Everything in this movie is just sooooooooooooooo terrible cliché! The cinematography, the dresses, the way everybody behaves.... ugh! If this is the way Americans look at Austria (or Germany and Switzerland, since I have the feeling that many do not really know the differences between these countries) than we really have a lot to do to correct this picture.But there is another reason, why I don't like this movie. It is really insulting to one's intelligence. The whole thing feels like it was made for kids (and done badly), everybody is virtuous, smiling all the time, bouncing around happily running through the countryside just enjoying being alive. Above all they sing songs that could come out of Sesame Street. Actually I was expecting a song that teaches you how to count to ten to pop up any minute. Come on! This is not beautiful, it is just plain dumb!There was a German oder Austrian movie made in the fifties called ""Die Trapp Familie"" and following its success, a sequel was produced later about their life in the US. The fifties in the history of German movies were notorious for the tacky ""Heimatfilme"" (homeland movies) that were produced in this era portraying Germany and Austria as happy beautiful places where happy people lived who did nothing but smile and enjoy the countryside all day long. ""Die Trapp Familie"" was one of these bad movies, but even this movie did not come close to the abomination that is ""The Sound of Music"". At least the former had some level, albeit small, of realism.I like Julie Andrews as an actress and singer, but this movie was not only not saved by her performance, but made even worse. I hope they put the German language track back on the dusty shelf where they found it and never show this movie in Germany again."
"As a teenager in the swingin' 60's, this movie was, to myself and every male contemporary, an object of derision, a sickly piece of confection for soppy girls and their mothers who had an unofficial competition running to find who had seen it the most times and consumed the most tissues.I finally came to it many years later in a moment of weakness, watching it alone, gratefully, as it was still suspect for a chap to have moist cheeks in a movie.The borderline between true sweetness and mawkish sentimentality in film is very hard to draw, but repeat viewings confirm that this is not a marginal case. The portrayal of that increasingly-scarce commodity, genuine innocence, is so finely played by the first-class cast that one can only marvel at how well they pull it off. This was a role that could have been made for showcasing the talents of Julie Andrews, and like most peak-of-career performances it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been condemned for being below the standards of their contemporaries (Gershwins, Berlin, Bernstein et al), and although that is arguable, it is also incontrovertible that the majority of their musical offerings have withstood the test of time for the sheer rightness of time and place of the songs that assist the dramatic flow rather than stopping it in its tracks. And their innate 'hummability' continues to sustain both the amateur and professional musical theatre in countless revivals.  Most modern musicals consistently fail to attract widespread support because while the writing may be more 'clever' in an often self-indulgent way, they lack the memorability of a single simple tune.I have just watched this film again with my daughters, 10 and 7, and while they have been unavoidably exposed to some of the harshness and cynicism of the 90's I was pleased to see that they accepted and enjoyed the film for what it is, an honest, highly agreeable telling of a story in words and music, that speaks of essential goodness amidst both bright and dark moments. This is the never-ending-story which will delight all those of cheerful heart for as long as films are shown."
"I like music. Crassics, pops, rocks and more. I also like playing the instruments and singing song. Anyways, I love music! So I like this movie so much. story is good, of course, but I think that good points of this movie are music. In this movie, many famous musics plays. I think the movie is masterpiece. I like Sixteen Going On Seventeen. This song is so cute and it is the best of songs in the movie. I watched this movie when I was a high school student at first time. I played Sound of Music Medley in regular concert of my club activity(wind orchestra) in high school. Music make the world to peace. This movie will makes us happy. I want to see this movie again,now."
"The Sound Of Music is a classic of the musical genre and is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The plot concerns a young Austrian woman called Maria (Julie Andrews) who is studying to be a nun in a convent and is sent to be a governess of the Von Trapp family by the Mother Abbess who feels that Maria would be more happy if she left the convent. During her stay, the Von Trapp family's lives begin to change forever. The dialogue is brilliant as every sentence suits each character and really brings them to life making you identify with them. The musical numbers are well-written and are some of the catchiest I've ever heard in a musical with songs such as ""Favourite Things"" and ""So Long, Farewell"" staying in my head for days and a beautiful score along with it. I also have to point out the engaging cinematography of Robert Wise who provides us with magnificent views of landscapes of the hills and mountains which really is the icing on the cake. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend anyone who loves cinema to watch this movie."
"Sometimes there's a cultural institution about which you just don't see the big fuss, and for me, it's this film. I got dragged to it at least twice as an 8-year-old, didn't really like it then, and still don't get it. I don't think the lyrics come close to some of the Oscar Hammerstein classics, the score is not among Rodgers' best, to me at least, and having said all that, I think from what I've heard, the Broadway score is better. The film score is much heavier, less folksy. I particularly don't like the opening, the booming, over-orchestrated film version of the title song, compared to the understated stage version of the same song. I much prefer Julie Andrews overall in ""Mary Poppins,"" and vocally, by far, in ""My Fair Lady."" If Christopher Plummer hated being in this movie, I think it shows. Having said all that, millions of people -- including my late mother, who rarely went to any movies, yet saw this at least three times, I think -- adore the film. So I guess I'm in the minority, but still, I have no desire to ever see this again."
"possible spoiler.I love old musicals, and I love the music in Sound of Music. And there's nothing wrong with the acting. But the movie is basically garbage. Maria Von Trapp wanted to sue the producers but found she had sold away this right. She loved the broadway play, but the movie completely distorted the facts of her life and her autobiography. Her husband was actually a gentle, loving father and husband, for starters. And the ending is a complete Hollywood fiction. The family actually left for America on a steamship with a contract for the family to tour the country giving performances. So much for dad Von Trapp despising singing. Christopher Plummer referred to it as ""The Sound of Treacle."" It's a great movie for children. But these adults who go gaga over it really should read Maria Von Trapp's autobiographies (in two volumes). The true story is much more interesting, and a much more inspiring testament to faith and fate."
"*** This review may contain spoilers ***A few days ago I was thinking,""What BEst Picutre winner should I choose for a review?"" Many to choose from of course The answer came to me Sunday,the day after Christmas 2010. NBC replayed this wonderful film and I watched it, since it had been a few years since seeing it.I recall on The Oprah Winfrey Show ,she had Julie Andrews,Christopher Plummer and all 7 of the,now grown,child actors who played the Von Trapp children. It was the first time they'd all been together in one place since 1965 and it was a very touching reunion. Growing up in the 1970s and 1980s,The Sound Of Music was on TV every year and when you're a kid,it usually is the first ""Best Picture"" Oscar winner that you ever see in your life. When you see it the first time,the moment you see Andrews in the hills and that sweeping camera shot,you know it's going to be something great.Like a lot kids,it was only natural I'd like songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"",""My Favorite Things,""So Long,Farewell"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd""(or ""The Yodeling Song"" as some call it) and more. I liked ""Edelweiss"" and ""Climb Every Mountain"" when I was older. It was on every year in our house.Julie Andrews' singing voice is no longer of this caliber but it's great that we have her in this and ""Mary Poppins"" and other movies,where we can marvel at her vocal abilities back then. Plummer turns in a somewhat serious but enjoyable performance. Going from stern and inflexible,then back to the father the children knew when their mother was alive,fair and loving and (of course) singing. Every kid has their own memorable moments as well The family's togetherness and fun is disrupted by the infiltration of the wretched Nazi party. They know they have to escape their own country now or live under the rule of a cruel & heartless dictatorship. That leads to the most exciting part of the movie. The clever departure after the concert,chase through the city and eventual escape over the mountains.The Sound Of Music,as we know,was a phenomenal success when it was released in March of 1965. It deservedly won for Best Picture and it's other categories. That success came about because it's simply a movie that the whole family and even those without families can enjoy. Which is why it's still so highly acclaimed even 45 years later.Lastly,because the people behind the scenes,as well as Andrews & Plummer themselves,made sure the film had an equal balance of fun and that of the serious as well. A job and movie,well done! Ten stars,for all time.(END)"
"I don't think this film is given enough credit. It is simply delightful. It's a romantic, heart-warming, feel-good movie. And what's more it's based on a true story. People will laugh at it, and perhaps mock it. Perhaps they are afraid or they simply do not understand it's greatness. But what you have to recognise is that the film IS a musical and so you have to expect the songs. They are after all well-written, and have good melodies. Also, i must mention the impeccable acting from both the children and Maria/Captain Von Trapp etc. Although the film is a little outdated in some aspects (the teenage boys on maria's bed for example), you cannot help but love this film."
"Once upon a time, when I was a child I thought certain truths were immutable... in the passing of time I found that almost none were. One of these truths that bit the bullet rather early in life was that all movies were good movies. Especially those films that everybody simply loved. At nine years old, I was taken by my parents to see ""The Sound of Music""... I wasn't crazy about it... but I figured I probably just didn't get it. When it was rereleased a few years later and I was 12 or so... I went to see it again with school. At that point I realized that the movie was just not that good! I couldn't wait to leave the theatre, I was bored to tears. I came to the conclusion that day that I was just never meant to be one of the ""masses""... sheeple who have no real opinion of their own. So for that I am forever indebted to this film. I also must caution men not to read any women's reviews of this movie as something about it causes their brains to go completely dead. How else can one explain anyone wanting to see someone fall in love with Christopher Plummer's character? Not masculine in any way (except that he has fathered a number of children) I feel he has caused more women to enter into disfunctional relationships and lead lonely lives in search of an unattainable male (gay?)than any other character in film history. p.s. I have since, in the last few years attempted the Sound of Music again and now find it absolutely unwatchable."
"What a loud of rubbish! What is the worst bit? 1)The nauseatingly sentimental kids, especially singing Good Night.2) Julie Andrews' ""posh"" voice and irritating ""jolliness"" 3) The Mother Superior's worn out singing voice.4) The schmaltzy travelogue photography of Austria.5) The unmitigated smugness of Von Trapp who stands on his high horse about Austria but all he seems to do is live in luxury and sulk.6) The trivial handling of the Nazi Anschloss.7) The phony middle class moral about surviving horrors by having plenty of money and an ability to train a choir of kids to sing in harmony. Tell that to some of the millions of victims of Nazism."
"This movie is the kind that makes people jump up and shout at the screen. Me, too, things like: ""Shut up, already!"" and ""Look behind the tombstone, you silly Nazis!""I guess when it comes to ""The Sound Of Music,"" you either have it, or you've had it. Count me in the latter camp. Oh, the film starts out strong, on one of the biggest shots in movies, and it has some beautiful camera work to go along with some nice if somewhat simplistic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But if Julie Andrews' other best-known musical, from 1964, involved a spoonful of sugar, this 1965 release feels more like a truckful of treacle, especially in the second half when the story gets ropier, the songs dodgier, and the acting too staged by half.Except for her singing where she shines, Andrews gives a distressingly one-note performance as a postulant nun, Maria, sent on sabbatical to look after the seven rambunctious children of a stern naval captain in Salzburg, Austria. In time, a remarkably condensed time, she has converted the children into a happy singing group and Captain von Trapp into a sappy velveteen Romeo. But will they find freedom as one big happy family, or else be crushed by the Nazi jackboot?I guess that's supposed to be the drama in this piece, but it's pushed together so haphazardly and drawn out so over the course of three hours that it never feels the least real, with or without the fruity singing. Maria sings about bluebirds and sleigh bells and whiskers on kittens, the kids perform ornate puppet shows and sing their way to bed before a party of admiring guests, and even Capt. von Trapp joins in, singing ""Edelweiss"" to an audience of Nazis so solemnly he puts them all to sleep so his family can escape.Even Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplays for ""North By Northwest"" and ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?"", pushes the trite meter past 11. The boys and girls all cry in unison when Maria guilts them over a frog trick or hide under her covers when thunder cracks overhead. I guess Lehman figured with a score that has them singing ""So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight...I flit/I float/I fleetly flee and flyyyy..."" these kids were on something stronger than schnitzel and noodles. The poor captain might have noticed this, except he's played by Christopher Plummer in such a tight-mouthed fog much of the time, you wonder if he's not hitting that wine cellar of his a bit too much.There are good numbers, namely the opening one with Andrews performing the title song on a mountain top in a nicely low-key hands-in-pockets way, and the best song in the score which follows that, ""How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?"" well-staged in an abbey courtyard as a dialogue amongst several nuns. One, Sister Sophia, brings an Audrey Hepburn-like quality to her singing. With director Robert Wise's steady hand and cinematographer Ted McCord's nice attention to the stained-glass and groined-ceiling decor, the sequence really sticks with you and is enjoyable to see over again.But Wise makes some odd decisions with other numbers that follow, especially the icky ""Edelweiss"" and ""16 Going On 17,"" a nice song undone by campy staging. ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain,"" a showstopper on stage, is performed by the Mother Abbess with a terribly trilly overdub and in such dark shadow you'd think she was a mob informant for the FBI. Actually, Wise says in his director's commentary that he was put off by the bombastic way he felt the song came off on stage, but his solution only makes things worse.Finally, the movie needed to end with the wedding, which while saccharine, is at least a pretty high note in keeping with what came before. The Nazi chase that follows is just silly, an attempt to add some movie drama that comes off as sour bubble gum.Two things to say in this movie's favor. One is lots and lots of people don't agree with me and have made ""The Sound Of Music"" a cultural touchstone. The other is the 40th anniversary of the film's release came with a DVD that is a very nice and generous package, chockful of generous add-ons like candid commentaries from Andrews and Wise, a delightful reminiscence by the now-grown actors who played the kids, and even a karaoke feature for those deluded souls who not only enjoy the movie, but sing along to it. If you like the movie, even a little, you probably owe it to yourself to get this DVD."
A good film but beware it's loaded with a very heavy dose of syrup. The characters are plastic and somewhat on the non-believable side. The scenery is perhaps the best part of the film. Based on a true story it wavers much from the actual true tale of the Von Trapp family. Yet to be a musical it would have to.
"For the most part this film has ranked as one of the most notoriously offensive pieces of rubbish that I ever have had the displeasure of watching, the strained voices and sugar coated ""cuteness"" are enough to make a grown man lose his lunch, or kill his family. Horrendous does not do it justice"
"When ""The Sound of Music"" premiered, Rex Harrison was in attendance. At the end of the show, he was asked what he thought of the movie. His answer, ""It was the first time in my life that I rooted for the Nazis!""I saw ""The Sound of Music"" on stage years ago, and it ran a little over 2 hours. This monstrosity of a film runs almost 3 hours. Talk about padding, and they even cut some of the songs from the stage version. While the stage presentation moved right along to keep your interest, this movie plods along at a snail's pace to bore you to tears. This show has great music, which is presented to much better effect on the Original Broadway Cast Recording with Mary Martin."
"This is the most unbelievable, and stupid movie I've ever seen. A family of singers runs from the Nazi's, and every few minutes they stop to sing about their ""Favorite things"" or how ""the hills are alive with the sound of music."" If I were running from the Nazi's, I wouldn't stop to sing every two seconds about the stupid hills! If this is based on a true story, then I'm the Queen of England.
Score: Not even 0, it doesn't deserve that many points. It owes us points, that's how bad it is."
"This is without doubt the most over inflated musical dross. It's reputation is better than the film itself. Rodgers and Hammerstein have done far better than this, but for some reason this is considered their classic work.Everything about it is predictable, contrived and trite. The songs are embarressingly simplistic. Forty years later and uncountable TV screenings later the film offers nothing in the way of entertainment. If you missed it count yourself lucky."
"I took me over 30 years to finally watch this film, something I did in 1998....and I could see why this is such a beloved film. I watched it one other time, about five years later on DVD, but didn't enjoy it as much and traded it for something else. However, I still have a high regard for the film. The film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s - a super-nice, old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews, who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here. In fact, her image from this was so squeaky-clean that she went out of her way to play some sleazy parts in coming years. Too bad. At least here, she's a joy to watch. The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film. Christopher Plummer is the male lead and once he loosens up, he's fine, too, as is the usually-funny Richard Haydn. Even the bad guys in this film - the Nazis (which include Eleanor Parker) - aren't prevalent. They don't have a lot of scenes in here even though they are an integral part to the story.The film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps.I did think there were too many songs in here, something of them done twice. That's too much. Maybe that's what made me think two viewings were enough. (I'm not big into musicals.) On my second viewing, for some reason, I found the movie too boring in too many spots, which means a number of them since it's almost three hours long in total. It was slow-starting and I just couldn't get into it. I am glad at least I could enjoy this once."
"I may not be the world's most exuberant man. My general attitude toward life is one of negativity and hatred. That said, I fail to see how even the most syrupy of happy types (the kind of people who sing on their way to camping holidays) can't see that this film is pure wrongness in many, many respects.The Von Trapp children are the most annoying creatures ever created. Whatever spawned them simply must be tracked down and eliminated. Why are they so happy? Why don't they mind all the ridiculous singing coming from that absurd woman? Why do they join in?Seriously, it may be crowd-pleasing, but I just don't like the attitude it's conveying."
"I saw this movie just a few days ago. I have seen a number of English movies, but this was special. I am from India and the movies here inevitably contain songs and dance numbers, barring a few exceptions. But as many as 10+ songs in a Western movie was something new for me, and it was unique. But I loved it. I showed the movie to my mother. She doesn't understand English very well, I had to keep interpreting the lines for her. But she too loved the movie. I had read somewhere, this is one movie, a copy of which should be there in every home on Earth. And i agree. It is an experience I wont ever forget. however, I wonder, why are musicals so rare in the west? we watch almost 100 Hollywood movies every year, and I have watched just two with songs. Movies from the west are good, I only wish they produce more of musicals, I am sure the world is ready for some of those. And I am sure, the west can make great musicals each month. I hope someone grants me my wish."
"After the breathtaking opening shots of the Alps, there's really nothing to like about this terrifyingly glib and overly jubilant movie musical about the struggle for freedom and love in Nazi Austria. Julie Andrews at least puts some effort into her character, but it doesn't work very well when she comes across as the one gold piece in the barrel full of tarnished pennies. Christopher Plummer is great at being domineering... but he's also great at taking in every scene for himself. And the children are just obnoxious. Every single one of them. Not to mention some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most dismal songs, unimpressively choreographed dance scenes, and a snobby Baroness who finds a way to bring the movie down even further. I liked this only a few years ago. Oh, how naive I was then! Now, I realize that it is the pampered child of R&H, while its more intelligent siblings are constantly berated in its shadow. I suppose it's all of those things (especially the way it overshadows its superiors) that make our hearts cursed with ""The Sound of Music."""
"I have to think that the people who rave about this movie have not seen the bulk of the MGM musicals.  If you want to see great musicals, see State Fair, South Pacific, or Oklahoma, for starters.  Except for Christopher Plummer, the acting in Sound of Music is awful. The movie weighs in at almost 3 hours and you'll feel every minute.  The movie is so long the songs have to all be sung several times, which is not a good thing.  Overblown, overhyped, overlong."
"One commentator has said: ""When I was young I used to picture the audience for this film as slightly deaf old women in surgical stockings and bad hats, and my attitude still holds."" Does he know how close to the truth that statement is? I remember as a kid being dragged to see this film by the family. I had already heard some of the music from this film on the radio, and it was so sickly sweet that I had to continuously fight the urge to vomit. So I was dreading to see the film.So I sat in the stalls of the Dominion in Tottenham Court Road with the family, which included the aunts in the surgical stockings and bad hats, some of whom had seen the film as many as six - yes, six - times and had somehow resisted the urge to throw themselves off Charing Cross Bridge into the murky waters of the endless mighty Thames.All my worst fears were confirmed. This film was as bad as I thought it would be.From the moment that Julie Andrews first appeared on the screen singing that sickly song, and having to endure the shrieks of the Reverend Mother, we are introduced to the dysfunctional Von Trapp family.It did have one benefit. I began to grow up fast after that, so that I would be big enough not to be dragged by the family to watch Von Crapp like this.Judging by some of the later parts played by Julie Andrews, I got the impression, rightly or wrongly, that even SHE realised she had made a mistake in appearing in this film, and was taking on ever more raunchier roles to compensate.Apart from the story, the dialogue, the lyrics, the conception, there is nothing technically wrong with this film. But if you have any intelligence at all you will not bear to watch it. As to those who have seen it many times, they all have one thing in common: they are all Roman Catholic. Many of them even think that this is a religious film. (Oh, they do. They do.) Finally, to those who have read my summary above, and who do not believe that I turned down a date with a good-looking girl because she wanted to see The Sound of Music, I can say that that is what happened. Literally. I like my women to have something upstairs. This girl clearly had not."
".. but me on the other hand, I didn't! And it's not because of bad film-making or anything like that. It just has to do with the fact, that the ""music"" and ""singing"" part, that I just didn't like at all! Yes I know, that's why it's called musical, but I saw the movie without any prior knowledge of what it's about or what genre it is, I just knew, that it's genuinely seen as a classic all over the world by many people.The story per se is also a good one, but with all the singing and dancing it felt too long. I do not want to affront anyone who's in love with this movie (we all have our own taste and that's a good thing), I'm just saying, that this movie was not getting to me ... at all! If you on the other hand, like drama (plus the musical part of it), all in a long movie, than you probably should watch this, if you haven't already! It remains after all a classic, despite my view of it :o)"
"A movie made in a time when directors like Robert Wise who knew how to craft a musical were still around. Suffers terribly when viewed on a small screen since the brilliant cinematography is such an integral factor of the movie. Get the newer THX widescreen video version and you will see a glimpse of what the film would be like on a big screen. The movie still holds up well to nineties standards but may be a little sugary for hardened modern moviegoers, used to a diet of violence and profanity. Wise manages to make Julie Andrews look both virginal and alluring at the same time, which is essential for the plot to work. It is hard to imagine the movie with any other actress than Andrews playing Maria's part. Some may criticize Roger and Hammerstein as not being in the same league as other noted movie composers, but here the combination of composers/director/actors all comes together in a way seldom matched."
"This movie brings out the very best in people.  It lifts the viewer even higher than the beautiful mountains around which the movie was filmed.  I first saw SOM as a high school boy of 16 and immediately fell in love with Julie (I'm glad she left the convent - probably not kosher to be in love with a nun).  Beautiful photography -outstanding music - while the script was charming, I think Julie's character was so sweet and so good that the experts believed that no one playing this role so well could EVER deserve to win an Oscar.  These experts were probably friends of those ""brilliant"" people who didn't think Julie was photogenic enough - or ""big"" enough to play the lead in ""My Fair Lady"" (I'm sure Marni Nixon appreciated the work, however).As an active duty army officer living in Heidelburg, Germany, we made numerous trips to Salzburg.  We loved visiting the different locations - running my daughters around the gazebo jumping from section to section just like in the movie.  What joy we experienced as my family lived out this musical during my three year tour.  As we drove around Austria listening to and singing the soundtrack on tape, I will always remember my six year old daughter (now 23) crying with sincere emotion each time the finale played as the Von Trapps crossed over the Alps to escape the Nazis.  What precious memories these are to my wife and me!  Some have said it is too sticky sweet - too sentimental.  To them I say, sweet -YES!  sentimental - YES!  I'll take these sweet and sentimental memories to my grave!"
"One Of The Best Movie I've Ever Seen This film is timeless, beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting, but I would advise that anyone who watches this would be mature enough, for anyone under the age of 15 will brush this movie aside, saying it is lame so as to maintain their level of coolness. I saw this happen when I asked my little sisters to watch it with me. They rolled their eyes and said the movie was terrible and boring. If only they understood. You have to have an open mind, and forget everything every little kid has said negative about this film. I never wanted to watch this, but some fellow high school seniors RECOMMENDED it to me. Obviously they had open minds, and they didn't care if they looked cool or not. Please watch this movie. It will make you happy, and it is so beautiful, you will almost cry. I had never really liked musicals, and perhaps I still do not overly enjoy them, but this film in all its beauty cut right through that barrier and took me with it to heaven, which is where it should belong, not on this horrible place where people condemn a musical film for being almost three hours."
"As Nazism is beginning to rise in Austria, a troublesome novice nun (Julie Andrews) is assigned to be the governess of the children of a Navy captain widower (Christopher Plummer) who defiantly opposes the Nazi movement.It's grand to see this magnificent musical on the large screen. There are those who have criticized the film for being too ""schamltzy"" but the magical moments far exceed the few that might seem amateurish.Among the performances, Andrews is rightly renowned as a good-hearted and soulful individual who tends to rebel against rigid rules. Plummer is sharp in his subtle wit. Peggy Wood, as the mother abbess, is easily convincing as a spiritual leader with heart and wisdom. And Eleanor Parker does a fine job as a snotty, spoiled one-percenter.Likewise, the scenery of Salzburg and its nearby mountains and villages are breathtaking. But it's the musical numbers that give this movie its rightful status as a classic. Among the highlights: the opening scene of the title song and the overture - both accompanied by stunning background scenery; the nuns singing beautiful Latin hymns followed by the more comical ""Maria"" which is also movingly repeated in a wedding scene; the truly joyous ""Do-Re-Mi"" which can bring out the child in all of us.Most moving of all is the show-stopping ""Climb Every Mountain"". It is magically sung by Margery MacKay who dubbed for Wood in a pivotal moment. When the song is used again for the affirming conclusion (following that joyfully impish line ""I have sinned, Reverend Mother""), the movie's ending leaves one with a feeling of spirit and joy that is wonderfully rare.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Songs by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein"
"Cinematography, scenery, music, acting, story-how perfect can you get?? A film which is timeless!!"
"Just a all time classic. One of the most original and suspenseful war films ever made. Up there with life is beautiful, Schindler's list and the pianist. Should be much higher"
"When I first saw The Sound of Music as a kid, I loved it. Then I watched a documentary about Marie Von Trapp's real life, and realised that the movie was nothing like reality. My opinion of the film dropped considerably. Then, a month or two ago, I sat down and watched the movie without prejudice, without comparing it to real life, just considering it purely as a movie.I love it! It may not be close to real life, but it's quite enjoyable. Julie Andrews - a year after her breakthrough it Mary Poppins - stars as Marie, a nun who doesn't fit in at the convent, and who is assigned as a governess for 7 children - who don't want a governess. The children and Marie bond, and romance blossoms between Marie and the children's hard father, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). However, the Nazis are on the rise.It's quite fun to watch, with lots of fun songs, and a nice story. I now quite enjoy it."
I've watched this film more times than I can count and why? Well it's a beautiful film and a movie that always puts me in a good mood. Julie Andrews plays Maria who goes to the Captain Von Trapp's household to be a frauline to help with his children. Of course it's a musical so there is lot's of singing but these songs are so nice and give me goosebumps every time. It really is like a fairy tale but that's what makes it so special. It's a very long film but guaranteed worth it! In my opinion of the best musicals ever!
"The Sound of Music is a legendary while heartwarming movie about story of a governess(nun), Maria, living in Captain von Trapp's house with seven children. This movie is based on a Broadway musical also called The Sound of Music of 1959. Because of the success and fame from the memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria Augusta von Trapp and the Tony awarded musical by Richard Rodgers, director Robert Wise and his team started the staging and filming of the movie version of The Sound of Music in 1960. The movie starred actors like Julie Andrews, who plays Maria, Christopher Plummer, who plays Captain, Richard Haydn, Eleanor Parker and so many more. The film released on the second of March in 1965 in the U.S. Because of the fantastic production and music, the movie became the highest grossing film of 1965 and one of the highest grossing film of all time. As of today, the film has grossed almost 1.3 billion dollars. 
 The Sound of Music is considered one of the best family movie of the 1900s. It is remembered by many people from different decades, countries and ages. The story starts with Maria, casted by Julie, signing on the hill about how she really likes the nature and life in the countryside of Austria. This scene is one of the prettiest scene in the movie. With the calm and relaxing background, it captures the energy of the actors and the film itself from the beginning. Maria is called to take care of Captain von Trapp's seven children. Captain, casted by Christopher, tells Maria all about the rules that she has to comply living with his children, such as marching around the house and going to bed on time(almost like military practices). This part of the movie captures the rigid routine and education of the 1940s. This also briefly brings out the setting of World War II. When the Captain is away to Vienna, Maria starts secretly taking the children to play and to sing. During this part of the movie, songs like ""Do-Re-Mi"" has born and ingrained on decades of people. Apart from just being relevant to the Broadway and Hollywood's community, schools has begun teaching children the songs from the movie for so many years too. In a party, Maria finds out that they might be in love with each other. Therefore, she flees back to abbey without telling the von Trapp family. The chemistry between Maria and Captain is very magical in the movie. The way Julie acts as a shy but adventurous girl in that love relationship could win her any awards for a leading actress. After a while of confessing their loves, Maria and Captain get married. Unfortunately, in the same time, Nazi Germany has taken over Austria and Captain is forced to serve in the navy under the Nazi. This part of the movie is very much tied to the history. It also conveys a conflict to the story which leads to a lovely singing scene by the von Trapp family. Because Captain is loyal to his country Austria, he plans on fleeing away. From playing in the Austrian show as the of the ""von Trapp Family Singers,"" they somehow find an escape. The story ends with the family climbing the mountain to escape the country. Even though it is not a particularly happy ending, the family is still able to stay together in the end. To me, this is the best way to end the movie because it ends with an open ending which gives audience an opportunity to think about both the ending and the movie in general.
 The Sound of Music is a multi-nominated and awarded movie. They received several Academy Award nominations while winning five of them: including the Best Picture and the Best Director. The story plot is wonderful because it is a lovely family story. The actors in the movie are really phenomenal too. Most of the actors are little kids but they show the talents and potentials of being good actors. Not only they have to sing, they also have to act in the same time. My favorite part of the movie is when the children sing the song ""Farewell"" in the party because they show both the fun and professional part of being actors. I also really admire how the youngest actress shows the shyness but also the stubborn part of her character throughout the movie. The leading, Golden Globe awarded actress Julie Andrews is fantastic in the movie from the start to the end. She shows the openness and happiness of Maria with her acting flawlessly. Besides, with the support of tunes like ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen,"" and ""My Favorite Things,"" the movie soundtrack also was ranked as number one album of the year in Billboard 200. The Sound of Music is also listed as the fifty-fifth greatest American movie according to American Film Institute. I would highly recommend this movie because of the production, artistry and chemistry among the actors. As the Library of Congress had once commented, ""The Sound of Music is culturally, historically and aesthetically significant;"" it is a movie that everyone must watch no matter what their ages are."

"Film adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical featuring great photography of Salzburg, Austria. A country that was annexed by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Featuring fantastic sing along songs that even for a more horror film fan like me I found enjoyable.Julie Andrews plays the lead role as a nun turned governess (nanny) Maria to an authoritarian family, the Von Trapp's with Christopher Plummer as it's head, widower naval Captain Von Trapp. A proud Austrian who despises the new Nazi regime.Now despite the charming music how can someone live their lives to the musical melodies like in The Sound Of Music?Director Robert Wise does an admirable job in bringing together excellent photography, music and storyline.A film that shows the full brilliance of the Austrian mountains."
Julie Andrews is my hero. The songs are wonderfully catchy.
"This is by far the best musical and movie of all times. I can watch it all over again everyday! I can never get tired ot watching it. 
Julie Andrews really nailed it !!"
"To be honest, I'm not a big fan of musicals but this one literally caught my heart. 
Great acting, dancing, singing, beautiful sceneries ... 
I was absolutely amazed by this masterpiece."
"Personally I'm not so crazy about musicals but this one I actually enjoyed. I thought that all the singing and dancing stuff is really carefully placed so it never took me out from the story, instead it did the opposite. It's about a troublemaker nun who becomes a governess for seven children and accidentally falls in love with their super rich widowed father."
