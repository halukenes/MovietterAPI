"I have seen the movie several times now and every time I watch it I see something new, something I haven't seen or heard before. Some unsung line, some lost message... Every time I watch the movie I seem to dig deeper into this complex work of art.However, I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that this movie is so underestimated, and, above all, misunderstood. How many times have you heard someone say something like: ""You can't watch 'The Wall' unless you're really drunk or really high"" ? I have heard this line probably from every single person that has seen the movie and it hurts me so much that nobody really tries to understand the movie.The key to understanding the movie is in the lyrics. The movie is not just a long series of video clips that accompany the album. The images are just a final piece of the puzzle, the final touch on a magnificent piece of art.The first time I saw this movie I felt very embarassed. Yes, embarassed, because I felt like a fool for hearing the album so many times and not realizing what it was about. The movie made me appreciate the lyrics of a rock song for the first time in my life.The week after seeing ""The Wall"" for the first time I bought Pink Floyd's ""The Final Cut"". Do you know what was the first thing I did when I opened the CD case? I read the lyrics, from the first to the last word. And I actually tried to understand what the album was about.""The Wall"" is so much more than you think it is. The only solution to not understaning the movie is watching it again and paying more attention. Once you get it, you will never forget it."
"""Pink Floyd The Wall"" is a great film, based on the already great album by Pink Floyd!  I was stunned by the use of imagery, combined with the great soundtrack of the album, which gave us a strange, drugged up vision of what a burnt out rock star would see.  It's really crazy!  Yet it shows how these famous rock stars are bombarded with fame and applause, and how insane it can drive an already disturbed person.  ""The Wall"" itself, is the isolation and separation from society and saneness, which is a place that can easily be avoided if only people gave us a fair chance to.  The depressing part about the film is that none of this is the rock star's fault.  He was driven to it by loneliness in his growing up years(since he lost his father to the war), along with psychological torment by his teachers, parents, and above all, his sexually controlling wife.  The movie is twisted because this is how the lead character sees the world.  Worse yet, after he has already been driven to the edge of his own sanity, in his mind, the people who drove him to that edge, come back to testify against him.  It's weird the first time you watch it, and looks a lot like a crazy music video that was pulled out of MTV.  The only difference is that this one is telling a story, and has been transferred to the big wide screen.  Alan Parker has directed the film, but Roger Waters seems to be in charge here, because it's his album, his story, and his conception.  All that's really been done here is transforming the album to celluloid.  I in some ways, like this better than the album, because now we have images to reinforce the songs and the story.  I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, because the variety of images and the loud music seem compressed and compacted on a small TV set.  You might not understand this the first time, especially if you haven't heard the album yet.  But it really is a great film, and it actually has a story and a point that most music videos today unfortunately lack!  I think that this film will teach people the reasons why these talented individuals suffer and lose their minds.  The people that have guided and taken care of them while they grew up, often take away their ability to happily and normally function on their own.  And the album and film's lesson is for not only the people who drove him to his wall to back off, but for him to pull himself out."
"Roger Waters has weaved a compelling visual of the journey of a disturbed and misled mind. Though the viewer is sometimes left to sort out obscure animations and confusing images, it is not without direction. Subsequent viewings of this film reveal substance that only a genius could imbue in his writing. Character development through such subtle action in places casts a light upon Roger Waters as a person who understands the frailty of the human mind. The main character, Pink, portrays angles of the human condition we all face at some point by embodying a victimized character: sick over the loss of his father to the war; negatively spotlighted at school for talents that are apparently unfavorable at the time; unable or just unwilling to relate to his wife; and ultimately shut off from effectively relating to others because of an inability to express himself in ways that others understand.Not only is the story captivating, but the music is such that it will always be noted as not only ahead of its time, but timeless.The Wall is a masterpiece of storytelling, but not in the traditional sense. One must not watch this film expecting everything on a silver platter. Symbolism and metaphors abound, leaving a great deal of interpretation and adaptation to the viewer. Sit with an open mind and let Waters' character help you read into yourself."
"Wow. this is truly a work of art. No, that isn't doing this movie justice. This is a masterpiece. No other rock opera, or most movies in general, can top the insanity that is this movie. This movie peers into the mind of an over protected, reclusive, and sometimes violent rock star, who has taken enough of life and the people in it. This is the story of Pink, poor old Pink, who's father left him one morning in black 44', and who's mother was so protective she smothered him with her love and all of her fears; who's wife tried so hard to open his heart, but found that nobody was home; and who eventually built a wall so high that he could not break free, and eventually his seclusion from the outside world brought out a side of Pink that he, nor the rest of the world, would wish to ever see. Soon his sadistic, Hitler-esc side takes control of the world, with help from his zombie like fans who follow any command that is thrown at them.But by the time the dictator is mentally faded away by Pink, and he is able to see that shielding himself from the world with his now endless wall is only driving him crazier, it could be too late. So goes the quote above, taken from ""The Trial"", which is the end of the Wall, and Pink's last chance for freedom from his Wall. This is just an outstanding movie. Everything works in this movie, the twisted live action, the animation that probably is what being insane is like, and, most of all, the music that is, in my opinion, the greatest album ever created (to Hell with Dark Side of the Moon, it was good, but it doesn't even compare to ""The Wall""). Pink Floyd is my favorite band (along with The Who and The Rolling Stones, an odd combination, I know), and when their best album was made into a movie, I knew that Hollywood had at least a little common sense, even though Hollywood shunned it, and most of the reviews I've read here are negative, but I don't care, I'm watching it and enjoying for me, and no other opinion matters. My favorite songs off of this movie/album are ""Mother"", ""One of My Turns"", ""There's Nobody Home"", ""Comfortably Numb"" (probably my favorite song, actually), and, of course, ""The Trial"".  One last thing, if you are ever in a position where you have to choose between this and ""Tommy"", pick this, because ""Tommy"" wasn't very good. In-fact, if it didn't have the great music of The Who in it, I would say it blew. Just a quick reminder. 10/10"
"What can you possibly say except that this movie is amazing?""The Wall"" is one of the few movies out there that has a powerful effect on the people are receptive to its message. Told with practically no dialogue, the only guide to the bizarre, frightening, and strange images is the incredible music by Pink Floyd, from their equally good double album. A considerable number of the songs were re-recorded for this movie, and one song (the heart-wrenching ""When the Tigers Broke Free"") was added. The new versions of the songs are sometimes worse than the album (Waiting for the Worms), and sometimes better (Mother, In the Flesh).""The Wall"" isn't a pleasant movie, nor is it a simplistic or banal movie. It is brutal, cynical, and disturbing, but it has moments of flesh-tingling beauty and an uplifting message in the end, if you persevere. I recommend both it and the album to anyone who enjoys a powerful movie. In my opinion, ""The Wall,"" along with a few other albums, represents the pinnacle of rock music."
"Alan Parker has always had a gift for the integration of music and film, and his efforts over the years have reflected that. Movies like ""Fame"" & ""The Commitments"" have made him a director more remembered for his music video skills than his storytelling, even though he directed gripping controversial more seriously films, like ""Midnight Express,"" and ""Mississippi Burning."" ""The Wall"" tells the account of a rock star's breakdown, Pink Floyd slowing down into madness... Pink's madness is illustrated with living flashbacks of his life... He has visions of his childhood from a baby held in the cradle to his present moment... We have little Pink suffering from alienation for the death of his father in the war, and taken under the care of his mother... We have also rock and roll star Pink, who is destroyed by his evident insanity and is driven over the edge by his wife's infidelity and we have a blown insane Pink, a Nazi dictator under the Hammer Regime leading a series of occurrences like raping, breaking and pillaging...Alan Parker translates the music into memorable images that are insensible to love or pity... All of Pink's life is projected on the screen... We see and hear songs altered from an abstract concept into a disgusting vision of students being thrown into a meat grinder...Pink constructs the wall by building up tension... In mixing up sexuality and violence, he creates a new window into Pink's character... The animated sequences that reflected Pink's foolishness are important and influential...Alan Parker's direction moves the story cleverly from the present into the past and into a possible future, drawing a warning, but still contemplating traumas of a child with hurtful effects on the fully grown man... The result is a mad piece of cinema, a kind of a bad dream becoming even worse than usual...The film exploits great special effects, some frightful and impossible to understand... The music praises the film so well from declaring noisy rock and roll music to quiet ballads of insanity...Bob Geldof is amazing as Pink, the British rock star broken in pieces under the psychological pressure of an American Tour...Pink Floyd-The Wall is a bizarre animation reinforcing its vision of an insane, inhumane, unjust and cruel world, not easy to follow...The film stands out as one of the classic in the teenage scene, specially teenagers who take or receive narcotic and due to its psychedelic nature leaves you greatly depressed..."
"If for whatever reason you should find yourself in the company of aliens from the planet Nietsche , a planet whose inhabitants have gone beyond what can be described as human nature so much so that they have no knowledge of what being human is , then show them this film that explains everything The story starts with the Anzio landings that sees the death of Pink's father . As Plato said "" Only the dead have seen the end of war "" and that is bitterly true , man will always be man and man will always kill man until the end of time Pink goes to school and education is a double edged sword . It has the potential to educate young humans but as often happens these young humans find themselves being used as victims of whatever mood the teacher is in . Someone must pay for authorities inaquequacies Pink leaves school and falls in love , but love is the sharpest and most double edged sword in all of creation . It inspires but it also destroys us . Despite hundreds of millions of human beings being killed in wars , genocide and purges there is nothing so personally painful or as cruel as the betrayal by a lover . The darkest pits of Hell can not be as hellish or as sadistic as infidelity As Pink descends further into his personal madness we see him take his revenge . Humans are sexual beings and perhaps this is what makes us both demons and avenging angels . Irony is to the fore as he stops becoming a victim and turns into unfeeling fascist dictator . Someone must pay for all the wrongs Pink has endured and it's the innocent that must suffer You could go to the planet Nietsche with all the written works of every human philosopher who ever lived and that still wouldn't be enough to explain what it's like to be human . As it stands Alan Parker and Roger Waters have made a cogent film explaining why humans are the way they are and how they react to the surrounding universe . It's a film whose soundtrack is every bit as powerful as the human condition"
"I recently rented and re-watched Pink Floyd The Wall for the 200th time, and I had forgotten, over the years, why this is my favorite movie. Surprisingly, the reason it is so good has little to do with a rock star having a mental breakdown. Pink being a rock star is almost incidental to the real message of the film. It seems as if director Parker took the initial idea of Pink Floyd's album and ran away with it. The film serves less as a study of one celebrity individual, instead serving as a cinematic indictment of all of our worst aspects as human beings: cruelty, brutality, insanity, herd mentality, fascism--all the most negative traits of twentieth century man are splashed upon the movie screen, as if the Director was asking the audience ""Why?"" This is a film in rebellion against the status quo. Funny then, that it should be driven by the music of a major rock and roll band. But, all in all, that is besides the point. The film of the Wall begins and ends with scenes of oppression by authoritarian figures (police men, skinheads, teachers, etc.)It is almost as if the entire sub textual content of the film is drawing a parallel between the internal alienation of a single individual and the social and global alienation that fostered the cruelties of World War 2, the holocaust, ad infinitum. Pinks degeneration is the degeneration of Everyman, confronted by a world that is (still) spinning increasingly out of control, away from the light, further behind the wall of its own nihilistic will toward self-obliteration. The violence of the imagery, the final ""Trial"", and the psychic attack of the final montage of disturbing images (masked children put into a meat grinder, cartoon teachers becoming hammers, neo-Nazis on a rampage) as the scene fades into a blank grey wall, are grand, satirical, operatic ""Theater of Cruelty"" in a cinematic framework. But it is the final lyric (sung by a repulsive, animated ""Judge"") that puts the entire scope of this picture into focus: ""I sentence you to be EXPOSED before your peers..."" The Judge , of course, is not merely talking to the fictional ""Pink"", but to the viewers of the film, and well, the entire world, for all that, and again, the Director has, seemingly, high jacked the ""rock opera"" format, and used it as a vehicle to ask that ultimate question: why is mankind so mutually interested in its own self-destruction? Why do nations and civilized cultures slide easily into fascistic thinking? How many war orphans are we still, to this day, creating?I am not, now, a fan of Pink Floyd's music, although all of the music in this film is beyond excellent. Oddly enough, I am the farthest thing from the dope-smoking ""hippy"" that is supposed to be a Pink Floyd fan. I am an Industrial musician and a writer. My favorite music, at this point, is anything by NON, Throbbing Gristle, etc. This film has, over the years though, shaped my own artistic outlook in ways I am probably not even aware of. One does not need to smoke dope, or even be a Pink Floyd fan, to be affected quite deeply by this film. Roger Ebert once said that Star Wars was, to him at least ""a perfect film"". Well, Pink Floyd The Wall, to myself, is a perfect film, whether you are a pothead or no. I have given this film ten stars, but it is a little beyond that. If it was simply a rock movie, it could be rated in a conventional manner. But Allan Parker has done something here that is beyond even the concept of the bestselling album that this movie is based upon. He has crafted a surreal essay on the madness and self-destruction that lurks within the human spirit. And he has created one of the most sobering, angry, and dizzying satirical pieces ever committed to celluloid. In short, this film is a work of sheer, jaundiced brilliance."
"The opening tracking shot of a hotel hallway that resembles a prison should clue you in as to what awaits. There are so many things to like and be fascinated by in this movie. And for all of its avant-garde leanings, this is actually a very classically designed story. An iconoclastic music star, Pink Floyd, tries/tries not to think about his past and how he got to where he is, which is borderline psychotic. And because he's so disturbed, he can't even think in a linear way, so the journey we take into his mind is necessarily whacked-out.We also get to see how fascism is born from misdirected hate and idolatry. As a rock star, Floyd has seen the adulation of his audiences, so he's familiar with the phenomenon. But at the same time, he detests them for buying into his act. It's like the old Groucho Marx joke about refusing membership to any group who would let you in. He knows he's a fake (his teachers and people like his wife have told him so), so everyone else who thinks he's real must be fakes also. It's a big cyclic game. So he can't let any of them in, behind his wall, because they are, by definition, phony.It's interesting, also, to think about how he has turned full circle into fascism. It's just part of his dream and how he deals with his anger, but it's also an interesting reaction to the absent father. Had there been no homosexuals or Jews etc., there would have been no need for a Hitler, and therefore there would have been no need for his father to die. But instead of hating Nazis, he hates the people that ""provoked"" the Nazis. (I could go on for days with stuff like this, but I'll stop here.)Just watch the movie and be impressed with the way it works on so many levels."
"If you like Pink Floyd, you'll love the movie regardless of what you think the cinematic value of the film is. To me, Roger Water's ability to express himself is outrageously smart. He is a genius. His English is masterful and the way he expresses how he feels is just mind-blowing. I am sure that every one of us has felt exactly the same as Pink/Roger felt at some point of our life but have never been able to successfully explain it. It is therefore my opinion that the lyrics are what make this film great. As a movie, it also translates those feelings well. All the actors were superb. Alan Parker managed to pull the whole thing together cleverly and all in all it is an excellent choice for a late night stoner's kick back - brilliant."
"Whether you're sober, buzzed, high, or fully baked this movie is enjoyable. Anyway you look at it. Some people will naturally say you can only watch it high for it to make sense. Ignore those pothead hippies. Don't get me wrong I love pot as much as the next guy but what they say is untrue. Maybe it's more enjoyable baked or drunk but what isn't? If you're under the age of 30 and over the age of 12 and haven't seen it feel free to join your generation anytime now. What you missing is a great movie about isolation, depression, and anger. And for those of you too baked for any amount of attention span put the movie on anyways cause the soundtrack rules. However if you ever run across a chance to see it at a theater, as a midnite matinee or just a run of old movies, pay any amount for admission it'll be worth it. For those of you who enjoy getting stoned and watching movies see Story Of Ricky. It's nearly as good as this. For those of you looking for insanity on video see Taxi Driver."
"A film made in the 80's  for children of the 60's.Pink Floyd's The Wall is arguably the best `rock opera' ever.  But the angst and societal issues that the album addresses only seem aged now.The film, by blending the original music plus skilful re-mixes and new tracks tells a simple story, but the imagery used is dark and disturbing and relates to the social issues of the time.  The film was made when the fears expressed in the novel 1984 were still a threat, (as an aside, while the film was being made in England there was a political campaign comparing the then conservative government of M. Thatcher to the Orwellian fascist world of 1984.)But, as much as I and other members of my generation can relate to this film, does it have a message for today's youth.  I think that it definitely does.  The issues today may be different from those of the late 70's, but, the sentiment and the dangers are the same.  We have huge segments of alienated people, we have bigotry and hate, and we have governments which operate in secret.  We have movements that preach rigid conformity and hate, we have religions that have lost the message of caring and we have schools that only want to turn out mindless corporate robots.In fact, I think that this film, and therefore the message behind the music, is MORE important today.  The issues we as a society face now are far more dangerous to personal freedoms than when it was first released."
"How to describe Pink Floyd The Wall? Feature length music video? Bad acid trip? Good acid trip? The Wall is one of those interesting experiments where I can imagine many people walking away, shaking their head, and saying ""What the hell was that?!?"" It is not a traditional narrative film by any definition, and yet it is not without some power from it's combination of images and music. It is difficult to define whether this is a film someone should check out or not, but it should mostly be based on your willingness to accept a movie that does not operate within the typical confines of standard cinema.The backstory to this project was formed when rock group Pink Floyd was wrapping up a major US tour in the 1970s and lead singer Roger Waters felt disconnection and contempt for his audience, going so far as to spit on a fan during the tour's final show. As a result of this experience, he conceived the concept album The Wall, a tale of isolation and the building of barriers between Waters and those around him. The album was later adapted into a major multimedia concert experience and finally, a film. Waters had originally wanted to film the concert, but director Alan Parker convinced him that that was a bad idea and instead pushed for an original film telling the story of the album in visuals. What emerged is an interesting collection of moments that do tell a tale of sorts, if a somewhat disjointed one.The basic outline of the film, as far as I can tell, is this: Pink (Bob Geldof), a rock singer, has isolated himself in a hotel suite and is slowly going insane. He remembers moments of his childhood, his father's perishing in World War II, his mother trying to fill the gaps, his education, etc. He later reminisces about his marriage and how he tries to push his wife away. He eventually snaps, trashing his hotel room and shaving off all his body hair in the process. When he is finally pulled out of his hotel room by his entourage, he envisions himself as a fascist dictator, bringing death and mayhem to all those around him.The above description is one interpretation of The Wall, I am sure there are others. The film is very much a tale about cutting oneself off from the world, retreating into the individual until there is nothing left for the mind to feed on but your own paranoia and unhappiness. Much of this material resonates, giving us a glimpse at ourselves at times. Parker's imagery, accompanied by animation by Gerald Scarfe, is surrealistic and difficult to penetrate at times, but The Wall eventually builds on you until you find yourself understanding more than you might think.Of course, the centerpiece of the film is the music by Pink Floyd. The Wall is often referred to as their greatest album, and it works well as a complement to the visuals. The music replaces dialogue in telling the tale, although, as with many rock albums, some of the lyrics are open for interpretation and if you are unfamiliar with the material, The Wall might prove more difficult to follow.Can I give The Wall a recommendation? To a certain extent, yes. It does have the ability to move you and some of the film's message is powerful and insightful. At the same time, is it easy to follow and without confusion? Not at all, and many people are just not comfortable with that kind of film. I would say that Pink Floyd The Wall is an acquired taste that may or may not be suitable for your palette."
"When his wife leaves him during a tour, the rock star Pink Floyd (Bob Geldof) becomes paranoid and mad, building a wall between the world in his mind and the real world. The process has begun when he was a child and loses his father in the war, missing him. His overprotective mother and the repressive education at school help to build the insanity process. Now he becomes a violent dictator and goes on trial in his mind, and tries to destroy the wall he built.""The Wall"" is a depressive and touching film by Roger Waters from The Pink Floyd and directed by Alan Parker. The screenplay is fantastic and each time the viewer sees this film, he or she will certainly discover new details that have not paid attention. The cast is excellent, highlighting the presence of the cult-actress Jenny Wright in the role of a groupie. The outstanding music score by Pink Floyd completes this masterpiece. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Pink Floyd - The Wall"""
"The work is a message of enlightenment. It is a visual illumination of what we are taught to think and believe from the very start of our lives to the culmination of the ultimate truth; that what we think is real is not real...our thoughts are only a glimpse of what truly exist. All we see are shadows on the wall. The more we try to make them real, the less real we become. We may realize this truth and awaken, our we may sink into our mind and allow the last brick of the wall to be laid.Fame does not make us real, nor sex nor power. These fleeting transient primordial manifestations of crude and separatist thought are masterfully illustrated in this work. Pink the child is taught to memorialize and believe in the symbology and ceremony of war. His intimacy with the subject is further intensified and rooted in, his father having served and been killed in action. The model of his identity was a man destroyed by and ideology. The seed of his insanity began with his identification with it though the coaxing of his elders and so thus the foundation of the wall began to take place.As we begin to realize the truth, we begin to see cracks in the wall. Soon the cracks become bigger and we may see what truly is there. At this moment we can choose to accept what is, or we can capitulate to the instinct to create an identity and start the process all over again. Though this may allow us o function in a periodicity that most may seem as normal, the bricks of several rebuilt walls amount to that of one large one. In a pragmatic society, this allows many to function as normal. Both are false. Both are insanity. One is accepted and even idolized as Pink became Floyd, the quasi Hitler adored for is super sized identity. But neither is truth.As our generation may be forced to play out the recycling dramas of a collective mind energy that has taken mass control of the planet, the hope of rebirth and the inevitable evolution of our species points to the hope that sooner rather than later, our mess will begin to be cleared. And so the movie ends with the children clearing the horrible rubble and debris of what one generation left.Our realization that we are not what people tell us, that there is more than what we see, that the separation between mass and energy time and space and all conventions of thought are imperfect, that the one truth and interconnectedness lies with in us, separate form our minds, brings us closer as a society to truth. It is a truth that is subtlety realized. More and more we realize it. There is no wall."
"I would not recommend this for those who haven't sat down and listened to the album about 10-20 times for multiple reasons. First of all, to get a basis from where the movie is coming from, it's essential that you familiarize yourself with the story - otherwise some may find the film very confusing at times. Also, Waters' original vision is found in the album without being filtered through the likes of Parsons and Scarfe, although they in my opinion did and excellent job. Finally, to get the full effect of music in a narrative form, such as THE WALL, one must create their own images of the music, for if you view someone else's interpretation first, it takes away the interactive aspect for the fans. In short, get the CD before the film."
"I think the story of the film is amazing. At Los Angeles, in a hotel room, a rock star whose name is Pink decides to build a wall made of bricks after he took stock of his life. He wants to build it for several reasons: a lot of people made him suffer, especially his mother his wife and his teacher, he wants to protect his identity because school made him faceless and he feels frustrated by his past life. But  when he's going crazy, he is taken to a concert but he's still travelling  through his fears and his dreams. The wall is in himself and he'll have to tear it down and come back to reality. I saw this film when I was fifteen and it enchanted me because I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd. I saw it recently and curiously It left me unsatisfied. Alan Parker and Roger Waters have made an audacious and seductive film and this one features some clever visual and ringing brainwaves. Moreover Bob Geldof is quite convincing in the main role of this helpless and outraged man; and the animation sequences are very successful and they epitomize Pink's inner universe, particularly the last sequence with the hideous judge. However the screenplay of the film is very repetitive: when a lot of pictures are passing by very quickly, the film looks like a huge clip and this one is multiplying the flashy effects. As a conclusion, even if this film isn't a masterpiece, it's probably Parker's best musical film, at least better than the boring ""The Commitments"""
"""Pink Floyd: The Wall"" is a celebration of spot-on directing, effective animation, and chilling yet powerful imagery. And it is one of the few musicals whose primary source of story-telling is the soundtrack. The main character is a rock star named Pink who has locked himself in his hotel room and is left to his own devices. Which in this case is his mind. And what we find down there when watching this movie, is pure insanity. Getting darker and darker as we go deeper and deeper into his head. He imagines his past and how it could have been different. For better or for worse. The film is brilliantly well done, and deserves a spot on any of my lists for the greatest musical of all time."
"Some people have told me that they didn't like this movie because they didn't understand it. Well, the first time I saw it, I understood it perfectly. This movie is excellent, is my favorite movie. Pink Floyd made an excellent work here. The movie is about a non-existent singer called Pink Floyd (as the real band). In the beginning, it shows Pink in his hotel, and then it comes to Pink's childhood. It shows Pink as a child and his mother, and how he loved her. After this, it shows Pink's terrible life at school. In the school ""there were certain teachers who would harm the children anyway they could"". With this life and the fact that the father died in World War II, it starts to make Pink insane. He, in his mind, starts to imagine things, and to create ""his own world"". This ""world"" is, in some way, the real world, but represented in another way. In this world, the faces of the children are masks, meaning that the teachers don't let the children see what is happening really, but hiding everything, and doing everything as the teachers want. In his imagination, Pink burns the school with other children, perfectly singing ""We don't need no education..."". But nothing really happens, is just in his mind. At the beginning, the links between the past, far-away past and present are very present. But later it stays in the present, and it shows Pink's life, with his wife. Because of this sad childhood, Pink is really depressive. So his wife goes with another man. And this is just ""another brick in the wall"". The wall is what Pink was creating since he was a child, that is, his own world, in his mind. In various parts of the movie we hear ""this is just another brick in the wall"", that is, another reason for Pink to continue doing the wall. After his wife leaves him, Pink goes with another woman, because he ""needs a dirty woman"". But this is just to prove that his wife's choice doesn't hurt him, because he's going with another woman. But he really doesn't do anything with her. Instead of that, he destroys his apartment. That's how the wall works. Everything after that are just bricks in the wall. And then, in fact, it shows a wall. This movie has various representations and we have to interpret it. That wall, completed, represents that Pink's world is complete in his mind. Now he just has to use it. Pink's life is confusing after this. It shows again links to the past, and then returning to the present. It all ends when Pink's manager discovers him drugged, and he takes him to the hospital. But in his way, Pink, in his wall, imagines that he has transformed in someone like Hitler. And that's how the wall works. The Hitler group, instead of be called ""Nazi"", are called ""Hammer"", but are with the same colors. Then he goes everywhere with this group, and is really a Nazi group, following ""the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews"". But this is just in his mind, nothing of that is really happening. But then he realizes that everything's wrong, that he wants a break of the wall. What is happening really is, maybe, that he's in the hospital (after all the drugs that he has as we see before). How he says that he wants a break? In this way: before it was mentioned that he has ""a little black book with his poems in"" (also seen in his school). Well, in his mind, he's reading a poem (that is really a Pink Floyd's song), called Stop, and he says, ""I wanna go home, take of this uniform and leave the show... I'm waiting in this cell because I have to know, have I been guilty all this time...?"". Guilty of making all that stuff like Hitler, in his mind. In the wall, this is good, but in the real world, this is bad. So he is not sure that what he's doing. Really, he's saying ""What I do, is good or bad?"". But because he has entered the wall, and now he has put a doubt about it, he goes into trial. In the trial, he's found guilty. And he's expelled of the wall. What is really happening? Pink's world is over. Pink has died (probably in the hospital), and this is confirmed by his last scream (when the wall explodes). The last scene shows children picking some stuff from the ground. That is how the world will end. A great movie. If you haven't seen it, see it now. The album is also great. Some tracks have changed. The movie is incredible-good-narrated with Pink Floyd's songs."
"Pink Floyd's best-selling double album is brought to the screen by maverick director Alan Parker as a visually stunning exercise in rock cinema.  Pink (Bob Geldof) is a burnt out rock star sitting silently in his hotel room awaiting the night's show.  On the verge of a mental break down, he gradually spirals into a drug-induced vortex of memories, premonitions and nightmares.  Parker's expressionistic visuals, Gerald Scarfe's surreal animation and Floyd's pounding music make for an extraordinary experience in sensory overload, and manage to overcome lyricist Roger Waters's often off-putting self-indulgence.  While never really becoming more than a feature length music video, it's still a great film and has developed a vigorous cult following.  Waters has a cameo as one of the witnesses in the wedding scene.  Nell Campbell (aka Little Nell, from The Rocky Horror Picture Show) and Joanne Whalley appear briefly as groupies.  Seeing this at a midnight showing on the big screen with Dolby Stereo was one of the most astounding cinematic experiences I've ever had!"
"Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" is a movie I heard so much about before finally watching it. Reason being, I never liked Floyd's music in the first place. Something about devil worship that someone at school told me.
As time passed, I discovered ""Dark Side of the Moon"", thanks in part to the engineering credits (I love everything Alan Parsons has done). The incredible workmanship of the album drew me closer to the group. And even then, ""The Wall"" was the last album I bought. Then, when the deluxe DVD edition came out, I jumped at it.What can I say? I watched the movie 3 times, and I couldn't still fully understand it. I loved the animations and became intrigued by the inner motivations of the main character, although there were some parts of the movie I just couldn't make anything of it. Then I decided to watch the extra materials that came with the DVD, including the running commentary by Roger Waters. And it all made sense. This is one powerful movie, an interesting rebellion against rock stardom and its perks. It's completely unexpected, since we are listening to all of this from a rock star himself, which makes it all too real. The groupies, the drugs, the alienation, the feeling of being sick and fed up with it all. This is not an uplifting movie by any means. In fact, Roger Waters summed it up pretty well describing it as ""a sour 2 hours"". And the fact that Mr. Waters has never been able to fully recover from the loss of his father makes it even worse (almost every Pink Floyd album - and a complete album, The Final Cut - has a song about his death in WWII). Even with this cons, the film is a must see for the animation sequences. And Bob Geldof proves he can act."
"You don't watch The Wall, you're absorbed into it.  The music of Pink Floyd is fused together with Alan Parker's striking images and Gerald Scarfe's brilliant animation. As Pink slowly descends into madness, we are given a first hand look at what has brought him to this point. The loss of his father, his relationship with his mother and wife, the teachers at the public school he attended and the burdens of rock stardom, all fit together to form his wall, that will eventually isolate him from society.  Once inside his wall, Pink goes through some changes and eventually puts himself on trial.  Scarfe's hallucinatory animation brings to life many songs from the album and gives the film a feel unlike any other.  Parker directs the live action with fire. One of the best sequences in the film is in the beginning.  As the housekeeper fiddles with Pink's door, we see in his mind a door locked with a chain move slightly.  Then, when the door opens and is stopped by the chain, the doors in Pink's mind fly open and thousands of fans rush in.  Then, Parker cuts to soldiers charging over beachheads as explosions scorch the land.  All of this is set to In The Flesh, the first track off of the album.  It's hard to talk about The Wall, in this forum.  The Wall is a film that needs to be seen, heard and absorbed in order to understand it."
"Just saw the film a few weeks ago for the first time on DVD. The film looks good, sounds good, and it's still holding up not only with the passage of time but the passage of my own personal life. There are times when I pick up ""The Wall"" (the album), give it a listen and think to myself ""god, what a self-absorbed person this is"". But I realize in my better moments that Roger Waters was just letting us in on some of his deep personal issues. I used to not understand how politics and the whole fascist angle related to the rest of the film, but at this point it all makes sense to me. Waters is saying that the ""walls"" that we build up individually in our lives to protect ourselves and separate ourselves from others are just miniature versions of the political and social walls built up by people who rule over others through fear and intimidation.On a technical level, only the scenes which integrate animation with live action have aged somewhat poorly. The film still has a striking and unique visual style, even after all these years of MTV that have followed.Geldorf is sufficient as ""Pink"", though he doesn't get many lines or much to do except sit in that room.All in all, a great film for Floyd fans but it might leave some non fans scratching their heads, because it's a film you have to see a few times and think about if you really want to ""get"" it. I know this film was panned by a lot of critics and also a lot of them said the film's stance was insulting to the Floyd's core audience. I couldn't disagree more, I think the Floyd never made the mistake of under-estimating their audience's intelligence and that they were here making a personal statement not only about their own lives (primarily Waters' and Barrett's) but about the changes in how they interact with their fans.I agree though with Waters' comments on the documentary -- the film's great weakness is that it lacks humor, even the biting or negative humor of Floyd songs like ""Have a Cigar"". I think possibly doing part of the film in a less documentary style, especially ""Young Lust"" would have helped here."
"Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" is a film in which I see tribute to from many modern day films. This film primarily focuses on the fascism and destruction of WWII, told through the eyes of a drugged out rock star.This film is definitely about more than just Pink Floyd's great music. Pink goes through a metamorphosis in the course of the movie. Pink starts as drugged out zombie rock star that feels nothing, not even for his beautiful and sexy wife who he once loved deeply. There is a message to be had throughout this film, if you can look past the music and drugs commonly associated with Pink Floyd.Slowly Pink's emotions build until the only way to control them is to let them loose as he hits rock bottom, realizing in many ways he has given up everything for nothing. As he regroups, he becomes cold and calculating, 'there can be no exceptions'. This conflict is meant to show how often the pendulum swings from one extreme right to the opposite extreme. By the end of the film, Pink has figured out what it means to be normal.If you've never seen The Wall, I'd recommend you see it. It's not for children, it's rated R. If you identify with many societal problems, for example the problems with public schools, you'll probably identify with most of the movie. At the same time, some of these parts are a little slow and some might find them boring or pointless. If you like Pink Floyd's music, then you really shouldn't find any parts of the movie too painful.This movie basically covers most of the songs in The Wall album which were redone for this production. It also features some songs from Pink Floyd's The Final Cut album. One of my favorite scenes is animated, and fans of The Final Cut's 'Not Now John' will recognize the music from this song in that scene of the movie.There is something for everyone to appreciate about this film.8/10"
"The Wall is perhaps the most spectacular film of all time. The Wall is so brilliantly written by Roger Waters that it is currently underway of becoming a Broadway-musical. The movie tells the story of Pink, a depressed psychotic, who has had to deal with a cheating wife and the death of his father before he was born.Another awesome experience that involves The Wall is to get high on drugs (i.e. marijuana), turn off the lights, turn up the volume fairly loud, and watch the movie. Several psychedelic illustrations in combination with the awesome sound of Pink Floyd is sure to give you a drug trip that you will never forget. Take it from me, I had never listened to Pink Floyd before I saw The Wall, but after I watched the movie high, I am now a huge fan of Pink Floyd and believe Roger Waters to be one of the most brilliant song writers of all time.One more thing, be smart, don't get caught."
"I remember when I was a little girl, I used to look at the cover of the VCR tape box to this movie and give it the strangest look, like ""What the hell is this?"" So, there is a brief childhood memory there.  heheheheheheee...Anyhow, I think that ""The Wall"" is one of the greatest music films of all time, because 1.  The plot to this movie is well written, 2.  Pink, the anti-sociable rock star played by Bob Geldof of the Boomtown Rats (remember ""I Don't Like Mondays"" and Live Aid?), is truly natural in this film, and Bob Geldof gave a beautifully brilliant performance, 3.  The animation is pure art and unique.  Ratherly different than you can see in any animated movie.Music lovers should really check this movie out!"
"Pink Floyd The Wall is a film rich in absolutely complex, surprisingly relatable themes and symbols. This film is not for everyone though, as it requires some input by the viewer through elaboration. It contains disturbing imagery and violent content, but with meaning behind it. All rock fans will be driven to the edge of their seat with this absolutely brilliant story of self-destruction told through the perspective of a slowly rotting man. Too much fame, drugs, and music have gotten the best of him, and it is up to him to tear down this metaphorical wall and re- enter society. Pink Floyd The Wall is a masterfully crafted psychological phenomenon!"
"Superb surreal psychological drama.Profound in its telling of the human condition. How everything in life later affects your personality, psyche and actions. And how you deal with these influences (or don't)...What makes it even better is that it is set to music. Yes, The Wall the album came first, and the movie is really fitted to the album, not the other way round. Still, I always figured the album was brilliant in being able to fit an entire 90-minute (or so) ultra-complex story to music, and excellent music at that.Around the music director Alan Parker, aided by animation director Gerald Scarfe, weaves an enthralling, intriguing visual kaleidoscope. There is hardly a word of dialogue in the whole movie (Pink/Bob Geldof only has one line in the movie), yet the movie is coherent and seamless.Truly a classic, and a ground-breaking one."
"Listening to Dark Side of the Moon, or in this case, watching The Wall is always a spiritual experience for me. How did I reach this point? Well, like so many of my generation, I grew up hearing Pink Floyd ad nauseam on the radio, never thinking much about it; their music was bizarre, otherworldly, and dreamlike, but nonetheless heard too often to be really appreciated. Fast forward to about 19. One of their songs from Dark Side of the Moon entered my head. Music always enters when I awake, even something I haven't heard in many years.So I sat down and listened, for the first time, really listened. It was like hearing Pink Floyd for the first time. The lyrics were... I couldn't believe it. Disillusioned with society, the narrator sees through all the stupid games, meaningless rituals and trappings that amount to an ultimately meaningless existence. Money, time... all a poison for the soul and the world that most people drift through without a second glance is a nightmare to anyone who sees it with these cold eyes. It was all spelled out there, as if straight from my mind but more clear and complete. So Dark Side of the Moon suddenly made sense, was completely profound and profoundly personal I had a similar experience with The Wall. This too was heard endlessly on the radio without thinking much of it, even after my aforementioned revelation. Only when I saw this film did it really fall into place, and in a major way. Pink Floyd: The Wall is many things to me. Depressing it certainly is, and a dangerous film for anyone battling depression. It broadens the world view introduced on Dark Side, adding to the bleakness, only this time the insanity flirted with on ""Brain Damage"" is explored in full.I haven't gone through absolutely everything that Pink experiences in the film (and I hope no one has to), but many of the scenes are a bit too real. They hit hard, and that's one thing about these Pink Floyd albums: they're profound and potentially beneficial, but far from easy to digest. I guess that's why I don't listen to them often; they're for special occasions when I'm truly ready for the trip.The Wall is indeed personal; I envisioned making this kind of movie years before I saw it. I'm a lover of the surreal and this movie certainly has that, not only in the excellently twisted animation of Gerald Scarfe but the central narrative in general. The animations, of course, complete the music like its missing half. These also create the most disturbing moments, the parts of the film that will really stay with you.The acting is great; I love the spontaneity and risks taken to ensure its realness - I certainly noticed that. The masks are appropriate, there's no other word for it, and the school children walking in unison was a great nod to Metropolis. Anyway, the way the visuals accompany the music is sometimes sad, or discomforting, but always completely fitting. Maybe I'll write more later. Right now I'm deliriously tired."
"This is the best movie I've seen by far. I loved every minute of it.Not only, is the imagery extremely fascinating, but the movie is so meaningful. Of course, the best thing about the movie is the awesome music. Surprisingly, I'm only twelve, but I am still a big fan of Pink Floyd and absolutely love this movie. Maybe liking this movie so much is one of the reasons I have very few friends at school, and all the kids that I go to school with think I'm retarded. But, anyway,that's not the point. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is ready to watch a movie about a man who has gone insane because heis incapable of stopping reliving his past. I found this movie to even help meunderstand life a little better."
"I love this movie. It is a very unusual movie but always keeps you entertained. Every time you watch it you find something new in it. The animation is a really cool effect that just adds to the strange and twisted mind of Pink. If you like Pink Floyd you should see it. It's got all the songs from the Wall album and puts a cool twist on them. Like for another brick in the wall part 2, they show a teacher pushing kids into a giant meat grinder shaped like a school. It only gets crazier from there. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age. It's a must see if your a Pink Floyd fan and a must see even if you don't like Pink Floyd because it could mean something completely different to you than to someone else, and that's why this movie is so good."
"""The Wall"" has aged very well. Except for Bob Geldorf's bad haircut (and that could have been worse) you never realize it is an 80's movie. Alan Parker and his crew did a wonderful job at bringing the classic Pink Floyd album to celluloid.Floyd fans will surely love the movie. I don't know if that can be said about other people, too, though. The movie is more or less a chain of good looking pictures, animation sequences with music. The story is somewhere ""hidden"" in the background. If I hadn't read about ""The Wall"" before, I probably wouldn't have had the foggiest idea what was going on. Also, non-Floyd fans or people who never heard anything about ""The Wall"" may be annoyed by Roger Water's rather arbitrary critizism on parenthood, teachers, politics and society in general.The movie represents everything the album stands for and gives us a pretty good vision of the pictures Roger Waters wants us to see when we listen to the music. It's all very artsy fartsy and pretentious but it really couldn't have been done any other way. Seeing how other great concept albums were turned into terrible movies (""Tommy""!) one must say that ""The Wall"" is one of the best Rock-movies there is. The Who's ""Quadrophenia"" is still my favourite, though."
"Pink Floyd released the album ""The Wall"" in (I believe) 1979. It was a huge hit with high school and college kids--especially the song ""Another Brick in the Wall Part 2"" with the ""we don't need no education"" line. It was a concept album about alienation which totally escaped most kids--they just liked it because of the loud music.Alan Parker made this film version a few years later. In it he follows the mental disintegration of a rock star named Pink (Bob Geldof). We see his whole life--his childhood, having an unnatural affection for his mom, his failed marriage, his drug abuse, his feelings of being all alone...and Pink completely explodes. I saw it opening night in Boston--I HATED it! The stereo sound blasted my ears out and the film keeps hitting you with morbid images of death, sex and some truly disturbing animation paired with Pink Floyd's ear-splitting music. Critics hated it too--they didn't review it seriously and just acted like it was a MTV movie video (!!!!) It died over here in America.Seeing it years later I realized I was totally wrong. I was ready this time for the non-stop depressing imagery and was absolutely fascinated. This movie has a lot to say about society, education and war. It's not an easy film to watch (it got a R rating back then--it would easily get an NC-17 today) and it will leave you incredibly depressed. Still it's fascinating to watch. Only one small complaint--they use some of the same imagery WAY too many times.I'm only giving it a 9 because it's such a downer."
"As big a misfire as The Who's Tommy film, The Wall is a 90 minute rock video masquerading as profound art. Perfectly reflecting the orphic personality of Floyd's Roger Waters, we are supposed to feel dreadfully sorry for the terrible burden cast upon rock star Pink, played in heated overdrive by Bob Geldof, another guy with an inflated head. There's tons of overbaked symbolism throughout the film: ooo, schoolchildren going into a meatgrinder! rock concerts as Nazi rallies! How DID they come up with this clever stuff? Even Gerald Scarfe's animated sequences are a disaster. Roger Waters needs to get over himself. The Pink Floyd were the ultimate reclusive rock band of the 70s, their increasingly pompous records only building higher the edifice that Waters wants us to believe is so burdensome. The Wall is also filled with pathetic victimology: it's my father's fault! the headmaster did it to me! my mother smothered me! the government is bad! One could even make the case that Roger is jealous of his old chum Syd Barrett, who simply turned on, tuned in and dropped out to avoid the oh so heavy mantle that Waters now wears.There are two or three decent David Gilmour songs in this film. That's about the best thing that can be said about Pink Floyd The Wall."
"Director Allan Parker once told an interviewer that the time spent on ""The Wall"" was ""one of the most miserable experiences in my creative life."" And for good reason. Because Roger Waters (former leader of Pink Floyd) forgot that he was a songwriter and not a screenwriter, this eroding feature film version of the band's blockbuster concept album follows the album to a T, proving itself undeniably predictable. ""The Wall"" (fantastic as an album) tells the story of Pink (Bob Geldof), a rock star who is traumatized by memories of an overprotective mother, wicked schoolteachers, a cheating wife, and a father he never knew. The poor, amateur script leaves no character exploration or that much of a plot for that matter. Geldof does little more than some singing and tantrum throwing, and when he's not doing that, he's staring into space in his hotel room. Parker's expertise was wasted on this ""movie""...the term is is used loosely, seeing as how ""The Wall"" is basically a two hour promo. Political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe's animation sequences are somewhat worthwhile, and the great music of Pink Floyd is always great to enjoy, but the film is just plain bad. Though it does remind the audience how awful it must be to be a famous, rich rock star."
"Pink Floyd as a band has withstood the test of time.30 years after The Wall, it's still a large influence on music in general, and a land mark out there.A concept album is like a book. When a book is made into a movie, the movie usually dictates the point of view they WANT you to see it from. Same story goes here with The Wall.Going by the movie, everything you may have thought was correct about The Wall must have been wrong since they had to sell out and couldn't make enough money without a multi-platinum album. The biggest one comes with drugs. The movie makes out the main character as if he's a junkie, while the album had nothing to do with drugs up until Comfortably Numb. That's a joke here. The other largest plot hole that is reversed in the album is ""Young Lust"" according to the album I'm pretty sure that he found out his wife was cheating on him, BEFORE he started sleeping around. In the movie it's the other way around.If you're a real fan and want to see the real way The Wall was meant to be told, check out ""Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live"". The live theatrical performance is far more mind blowing and entertaining than anything in this film. The Wall is easily one of the greatest stories ever told in music but also the true breaking point of Pink Floyd. For my money I wouldn't say it's their best album (Think Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here) but it is a statement of how over blown Roger Waters ego had become. This is more of Roger's album than the band, which is why I don't consider it their best work. When they work together as a band you got better albums.This film really should be an example of why albums should never ever be even considered to be made into films. There is a great number of concept albums in this world that really are touching besides The Wall that have not been ruined by films. After watching this movie, I got the point why David Bowie never wanted Ziggy Stardust to be a movie character. It totally ruins the story and concept as a whole."
"I saw this again after a long absence. I like the layers.Start with an ordinary man. No, perhaps less than ordinary, with banal epiphanies and sophomoric insights.Have him create a concept album using this wan stuff using the tools of popular music. Not rock. This is closer to Sondheim than Springstein and is the sort of overproduced simple music that U2 does now. Passionless but catchy and with simple thoughts. That's two layers now.Third, create a stage show to illustrate the music. This is where it really gets interesting because Gerald Scarfe gets involved. You may know him as a talented illustrator, but consider this: At this time he was sleeping with (and would later marry) Jane Asher. You may not know who Jane is, but if screwing Yoko was what killed the Beatles, the best concept band in history  screwing Jane was what caused it to be born. Jane is the source, or rather sex with Jane is the source of all rock concepts, period.(Eleanor David, a Jane-like redhead, plays Pink's wife here.)Gerald drew her labia and made one of the most erotic and terrifying film sequences ever for this stage show. A male flower and a female, both beings in the form of genitals only. She seduces, he complies. She dances the dance of Scheherazade, a thousand stories, nay a billion. He enters boldly. Then she swallows pleasure, thus turning mean and cruel, an engorged dragon. And all but eats our hapless, now limp lad. It isn't the way I see the world, no no, but it is an image sequence that you will never, ever forget. That's our third layer and generates the image I want you to see before you die.Now they all approach Alan Parker to make a movie. Alan is a great imagineer, a risk taker. Someone who knows the edges. Its dull material  Nazis again  but he does an okay job. I think he may have had the idea for the masks. Great masks.Four layers. Four masks. Four labial swallows.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Quite possibly the most psychedelic film ever created. Screenplay written by Roger Waters shows us the loneliness of what fame and fortune can bring to a person. Stumbling around in a drunken stupor, Pink (Bob Geldof) realizes his senses are breaking down past the point of no return. Growing up fatherless during the second world war, he tries to gain some sense of freedom with friends or family but feels his surroundings are entangling around his neck like a noose. Upon reaching stardom with his music, most of the time he spends alone watching old war programs, possibly wanting to see his father in some of the old reels. On top of that, his wife leaving him for an activist, leaving him completely alone. With his unbinding success as a rock star, his level of comprehension begins to fade away into something else, with the help of alcohol and drugs. His persona breaking down into a faded memory, culminating with past memories that continue to drown his reasoning, he metamorphosis's to what he hates the most. A self preserving ego maniac with a fascist complex. The artistry and music blended so well with his psychotic breakdown that he could not tell if he was dreaming or awake. This film will remain one of the most important classics to show what fame and fortune can do to a mans head. And why it is so important to the music industry today. From what I know the album (Dark side of the moon) has not left the charts for nearly thirty years for albums sold. Making this group (Pink Floyd) the most influential bands of all time. Excellent film, beautiful music."
"""Pink Floyd: The Wall"" is a cult classic rock opera, in a similar vein as ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""Tommy."" The story, told through the music of Pink Floyd, is about a deeply disturbed rock star named Pink, played by Bob Geldof of the Boomtown Rats. He is scarred by many things: the death of his father, a rough childhood, his overprotective mother, a failed marriage, and the rigors of the rock and roll lifestyle. His mind is packed with weird and chilling images: the horrors of war, visions of a fascist world, and the darkness in his own soul. He sees a horrible place where everyone is just a brick in the wall. This surreal rock video is a wonderful product from the lunatics in the heads of composer Roger Waters, director Alan Parker and designer Gerald Scarfe. The music is accompanied by many strange and unsettling scenes. Scarfe's animations add to the weirdness. Call ""The Wall"" a masterpiece or a nightmare. But you will see the strength that made this movie a cult classic."
"I've spent the last hour reading users's comments on this movie and I am dissatisfied with what I read. I watched ""The Wall"" and understood very little of it. Yes, I got that little Pink was very upset with the death of his father, yes, I understood that he had a stressed and sarcastic teacher which spilled his frustrations on kids and that his wife cheated on him(yet these are all obvious, and not so meaningful - aka I wouldn't make a movie based upon such events). But I guess I always expect a movie that seems too difficult to understand to be a masterpiece that my simple mind can't quite cope with. And so I hoped that others may enlighten me... I learned that this movie is about Pink Floyd which had a sad childhood due to his father's death and his teacher that made fun of his artistic talent and persecuted him and also due to his overprotecting mother. Then he found the courage to express himself and broke free from his home (I suppose, cause the movie lacks this part..anyway, otherwise how could a sad, overprotected kid get in a rock band??). He got married and also became this famous rock-star. But his wife is now cheating on him - a heavy hit on the man. All in all he figures out that the best thing for him to do is create a defense WALL(and that's...""the wall"") around him, in order to never get hurt again. So he becomes a sort of a schizophrenic, and one suffering from drug abuse too - he didn't talk to anybody and only stood like a vegetable and watched TV. Occasionally he would devastate his apartment.. I also read that he would have had a double personality - the man on stage and the frightened isolated schizophrenic. Oh well, or so you people say...But why would this movie be considered a masterpiece? Why is the character so great? He is a poor guy who lost his dad, OK, like many others, and whose wife is cheating on him, like many other wives do. And OK, if you say so, he is talented too... But something doesn't quite fit.If he was such a great artist and his poems were brilliant and meaningful, how come he let himself, a genius, go mad over a normal man's problems? What kind of a ""superior man"" was he? Why should people have listened to him (he thinks of him as a Nazi-like leader, controlling people's minds, right?) - are people really that stupid? I really don't see the greatness of this character (so as to make a movie about his life anyway...). He's not even a symbol of the ordinary man - I could have found myself in him if he were and the movie would have meant something to me.I wished really hard that this movie would be philosophical and I waited for the revealing of the symbols. First I though that maybe people are bricks in the wall and that the movie criticizes the mechanism of society(or maybe a sort of political regime or a specific country's society - the USA or England). But to accept this is a movie about a drunken, failure of a rock-star and that others agree to this and score the movie with a ten...is what is truly depressing!Oh and also the idea of getting stoned before seeing it... Only losers need to get stoned to be able to do something. I really hope the people who comment on IMDb are smart guys...so please don't say things like ""you need to get stoned to understand this movie""From my point of view it totally lacks content compared to what everyone says - unfortunately I have nothing to learn from it."
"First of all, I am not a 'die hard Pink Floyd fan', though I can appreciate most of their songs and Roger Waters his work, plus I simply can't deny that ""The Wall"" is one of the greatest albums of all time. This movie helps you to appreciate the album even more. The movie its visuals support the lyrics from the songs from the album and helps you to understand what the lyrics are all truly about. It makes the movie work both as a rock/music movie and as a statement.The movie features lots of 'beautiful' visuals and is filled with symbolism and deeper meanings. It's really one of those movies in which you discover new things, you hadn't noticed before, on every viewing. The movie uses both live action footage and animated sequences. Both styles mix really well and especially the animated sequences are something truly unforgettable. A real piece of art! Especially the in my opinion, classic ending is a true pleasure to watch.The movie has lots of criticism on society and features elements such as; Relationships, childhood, WWII drug abuse, sex and fascism. It clearly is not a movie for just everyone. Most people will most likely find this movie just too 'odd' for their taste. Yes, visually it is an odd movie but the lyrics helps you to understand what this movie is truly about. I shall not pretend as if I fully understood every element of the movie but like I said before, you'll discover some new things every time you watch this movie.In my opinion everyone should give this movie a chance, at least once but it's recommended to watch this movie several times before judging it.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Pink Floyd (Bob Geldof) is a rock star in a catatonic state of paranoia and madness, building a wall between the world in his mind and the real world. Through flashbacks, the viewer acknowledges his madness process, started in his childhood with the loss of his father in the World War II. The privation of a father, the education in a repressive English school and the creation given by his mother contribute to his insanity, culminating with the use of drugs to present the shows in a tour and the infidelity of his wife. After this process, he becomes a violent dictator. This depressive film joins the music of my favorite progressive music band with the work of one of my favorite directors, Alan Parker. 'Midnight Express' is probably among my twenty favorite movies ever. This director has a great experience with musicals in films like 'Fame', 'The Commitments' and 'Evita'. 'Pink Floyd The Wall' has very touching scenes, like when the little Pinky gives his hand and follows the father of another child; has great moments, like in the sequence beginning with an eagle and ending with blood flowing to a gutter and then to a sewer; has lots of paranoia. It is visually wonderful with a magnificent soundtrack. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Pink Floyd  The Wall'"
"(Hullo, Esteryosi! E-mail me.)Before I saw this ""legendary"" musical drama, the only song I ever knew from the album was ""Another Brick In The Wall"", a very good song with a terrific guitar solo. Surprise, surprise: it turned out to be by far the only good piece of music from the album/movie. ""The Wall"" is full of awful wailing (singing?) by Waters (or is it Gilmour? I really couldn't care less who was responsible for these ear-killing off-key vocals), and songs so forgettable I wouldn't even use them as fillers for far worse bands such as R.E.M. Even Michael Stipe deserves better filler songs! So much for the music.The movie is like a 90-minute MTV video. It is pretentious, confusing, and muddled, quite clearly conceived by an inferior mind who fancies himself a genius. (Plus, vague images lend themselves quite well to free interpretation, don't they?) Roger Waters: the man, the legend, the total and utter fool. Apparently, in order to catch all of Waters's trite ""messages"", one needs to have read the lyrics sheet beforehand. The singing, apart from being terrible, also requires subtitles. I've heard death metal bands whose lyrics are more audible. ""Shroovederr gooblred a blatt on the hrunkchgrbr..."" Huh? ""The Wall"" is basically a messy concoction of images that are intended to shock and provoke ANY kind of emotional reaction which would then lead the viewer to ""think"", speculate. To think very deeply. Oh-so veeery deeply about the amazingly deeeep messages: the kind of political and social babble one has become used to hearing from rock stars of questionable intelligence. Nazism comes out of personal frustrations? Sure, but perhaps it also comes from sheer psychopathy, i.e. has nothing to do with the up-bringing? I have always hated this idea that all tyrants and murderers had sad childhoods: what malarkey. That's the kind of rationalizing utilized by people too weak to face the cold realities of life. Besides, doesn't the extreme Left draw just as many lunatics into its own ranks? Not according to Waters, I'm sure. We will rarely or never see Communists being used as symbols of evil, in spite of the incredible amount of damage that ideology has inflicted in less than a century all over the globe. Instead, some left-wing viewers even see Geldoff's Nazi Party as a sort of ""clever"" jab at Thatcher's government, which is just the sort of nonsensical thinking one could expect from a band such as Pink Floyd. (Musicians, not thinkers - whatever they might think of themselves.) Speaking of symbolism, you'd think that the makers of this film would have realized that using a double hammer as the Nazi motif would be rather ironic because of the Communist hammer & sickle. I'm certain this was NOT intentional, because there was absolutely nothing about the way the Nazis were portrayed to suggest that this Party was supposed to have elements of the extreme Left in it, as well. It exposes how little intelligent thought went into the making of this dull movie.I am also annoyed by the general premise: a rock star, very annoyingly called Pink Floyd, can't come to terms with his father's death, the way the teachers treated him, that his wife cheated him, etc, hence falls into some emotional abyss that leads him into political extremism. The poor dear: everyone is to blame for his misery except himself. The fact that this unappealing, whining character is played by Bob Geldoff only makes things worse. However, it is fitting. Geldoff is just as arrogant and self-righteous as Roger Waters and his merry band of pretentious ""pomp rockers"".The movie has an ugly visual look to boot. Real-life scenes alternate with rather unoriginal, hippie-like animation, but the two never gel properly; it's as if they came from two different movies/projects.I love Waters's hypocrisy: in one song/scene there is criticism made of the materialistic pursuits of the modern world - just the kind of rubbish we often get from anti-Capitalist elitists. This, coming from a rock star who would rather have his legs amputated than rid himself of all his villas, yachts, fast cars and tons of cocaine??... Unbelievable. I love those jet-set ""humanitarians"".For more of my music-world rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1"
"Fun! I mean, I enjoyed the experience :) I want to be a fisherman. One of the harvesters of the sea."
"Have you ever had a nightmare that was so disturbing and surreal that you wanted it to end but then when you wake up you cannot wait to tell your friends about it? Have you ever had a dream so outlandish that you know it could not have actually happened but you remember it like a real memory? That nightmare is Alan Parker's Pink Floyd's The Wall. This movie is the closest I have ever seen to an actual nightmare. This movie was quoted as being the most unpleasant experience of Alan Parker's life, it caused much tension between Roger Waters and the rest of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters did not like the end result. Although all of this is unfortunate for those involved, what came out of this misery was a fantastic film. The almost complete lack of dialogue, the excellent usage of Pink Floyd's captivating album, and the surreal animation sections of the film makes this film a visual and auditory experience. The film hits the themes of the aftermath that war left on people and Britain, corrupt teachers (excellent and infamous ""Another Brick in The Wall Part 2"" scene), marriage, fascism as an allegory for fame, and the events in life that snowball into human isolation; the building of The Wall. I pulled a one nighter (new term I made up) and listened to the whole album of The Wall then watched the film. I expected disturbing, screwed up, and rock and roll fueled anger and sorrow and I did get it, but one emotion I did not expected accumulated from this listening and viewing; sadness. Both the film and the album are practically the story of a man secluded himself from everyone and it is a very alienating and depressing experience. Through all of the violent imagery and all out bizarreness, there is a deep human message at the center-most brick of The Wall. That is why it seems like a plausible nightmare. The Wall is not always easy to watch and most won't even like it, but it is hard to admit that it is not oddly fascinating.Ultimately everything about this movie surprised me. The direction, the animation, the narrative, the cinematography (incredibly ahead of it's time); all amazing!!! One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the performance as the troubled rock star and protagonist, Pink, by Boomtown Rat's Bob Geldoff. Geldoff was not an actor. He did not like Pink Floyd. He could not be more different than Pink (in fact, violence makes Geldoff sick) but casting Geldoff for some weird reason, was genius. Geldoff pulls off a convincing, wordless performance as Pink. Final tidbit: Although I am a lover of film, I tend to get easily distracted by social media and other things during films. I did not pause this film once. For better or for worse, it hooks you in the whole time. Once you start building', there is no way back."
"Being a massive Pink Floyd fan I felt like I had to watch this film. For some strange reason, part of me expected not to like the film and to only enjoy the music. But this was not the case. This film is intriguing, bold, disturbing, clever and ambitious all at the same time. Alan Parker does a great job at blending the scenes with the music and brings forward, Roger Waters' original vision to the screen, perfectly. Another highlight is the cinematography. It is absolutely fantastic. It (as well as the set- decoration and Bob Geldof's depressing performance) truly adds to the mood of the film.Probably the best scenes for me was the In the Flesh/Run Like Hell/Waiting For The Worms scenes. They seemed to be filmed to absolute perfection and they are also the best songs from the album.This film is a must watch for fans of Pink Floyd and The Wall as it truly tells the story perfectly."
"Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as ""the devil's music"" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said.The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously.The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier.Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979.Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man.Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only)."
"I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties.The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons.Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall.OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film."
"The album by Pink Floyd known as ""The Wall"" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a ""wall"" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the ""bricks"" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10."
"Hard to believe that people find fault with THE WALL. What's there to dislike? It's got great performances. There's great music by one of the best bands of all time. The director turns us on our heads and sends us spinning.But it's certainly not the usual rock star extravaganza, which may be the problem. I suppose some folks don't like to think. They'd prefer to be entertained, particularly in a rock and roll setting. Bigger, dumber, louder. God, I wish Motley Crue would have made this movie. I can see it now: instead of performances, there could be makeup. Instead of style, there could be swagger. Instead of great music, there could bewell, whatever it is that Motley Crue would bring to the table.And I'm sure there'd be tattoos. Sometimes, that's enough."
"To me The Wall is a perfect blend of animation, dialog (which there was hardly any of but still deserves to be acknowledged), music, the beautiful and the ugly. Scenes like the opening scene of the hotel are simple, yet beautiful. This movie covers a lot of ground, from World War II, Pink's early life, Pink's life in his hotel, and his transformation into a fascist leader, all while using the music as the narrator. Just that this movie could show us so much and still be focused on the main story shows what a well made work of art this is. The movie does get a bit slow during the parts without any music though, but this isn't something that would stop me from watching it many more times.Before I saw The Wall I was not too impressed with the album, but seeing the movie has definitely added a new dimension to the music."
"The thing about ""The Wall"" is, it's art. Not because it's a movie and it most definitely falls under the category of 'film', not because of the way the movie itself is put together, because that too, can be placed into it's own category. 'The Wall' is art because of the words. The way the pictures/clips co-mingle with the music, it makes it a masterpiece.The first time I ever saw 'The Wall', I was 12. Maybe 11. I can't remember. I feel in love. The music, the characters, the authentic stamp of beauty that was inbedded into each stanza of a song, into each frame of a clip; it all combined in my mind and left a stamp.I am only 14 now, but 'The Wall' is definitely the most fabulous movie I've ever seen. I think that EVERYONE should see this movie, not only with your eyes, but with your soul and you heart."
"Pink Floyd: The Wall B+/A+ 4.1.00 2.35:1/5.1 Previously Viewed Anamorphic WidescreenWhatever you think of Floyd and their music (I am a big fan), this movie is tremendous audio/visual experience; possibly the best I've seen. Thankfully, the DVD does everything right in bringing the experience to home theater.  It looks and sounds fantastic, and there are extras galore. Highly recommended!"
"The Wall tells the story of Pink; a burnt out rock star who has retreated into himself. Told in a non-linear fashion we see how he is effected by the loss of the father he never knew in the war; cruel teachers; a wife who leaves him; the adulation of his fans and too many drugs and finally how he grows to see himself as a fascist demagogue.This is a far from conventional film; there is a minimal amount of dialogue. Instead the story is told through the images we see and the music of Pink Floyd. The images are a mix of conventional live action shots of Pink's life; images of war and animation designed by Gerald Scarfe. This is sometimes tragic and sometimes brutally disturbing. The scenes we see perfectly match the music; adding something to what isn't there on the album in a way that makes it hard to just listen without recalling the imagery. The animated sequences demand separate mention; they are creative and shocking in a way one doesn't expect in western animation; they contain a sense of bleakness, brutality and even flowers that border on pornographic! Overall I'd say that this is a must see for fans of Pink Floyd and for those looking for something different who don't mind being disturbed."
"The Cinematic adaptation of the classic Pink Floyd´s Album ""The Wall"" is certainly a bit of a mix bag in some of the scenes, sometimes it carries the spirit of the album and the amazing setting and sounds from the Live versions, but the other parts of the time, it feels like a sureal trip that sounds and looks more like a student film rather then the adaptation of a classic Rock Album. Though, even with that, The Wall is still an amazing version of the album, capturing the horror and surreal nature of Pink Floyd.
The story is rather simple: Pink is a rockstar that starts to build a mental Wall made out of bricks, each brick is a fear or a trauma, though, as the Wall starts to get higher and higher, Pink´s insanity starts to grow.
That´s basically everything, the power of ""The Wall"" isn´t in a strong story, it all lies in the emotional Journey and the alucinations of our RockStar. Bob Geldof really captures that Druggedoutofhishead character, even though his singing can be Hit or Miss, but you dont really need an amazing singer for this movie, you just need a more theatrical approach, in that sense, Geldof is probably the perfect Pink.
Now, the best aspect of the film besides the amazing Music and Acting, it´s the animated sequences, though some of them are stripped from the original Projection of the concerts, that really doesnt matter, besides, some of them are expanded, ""What shall we do Now"" finished with the Rose turning on a monster, in the Movie, it continues, seeing that The Wall is not only made from Fears, it´s also made out of greed and lust. ""Goodbye Bluesky"" didnt had an animation, and it´s one of the movie´s most iconic scenes next to ""In the Flesh"" and ""Don´t leave me now"" All of the characters being designed by the amazing Gerard Scarfe.
Now, the main problem for me, it´s the scenes where Alan Parker tried to ground the movie a bit more, you can sense it in some of the scenes like ""Young Lust"" but that doesnt mean he cant stage Pink´s Madness, ""Dont Leave me now"" and ""Thin Ice"" are visual master pieces, even though it includes lots of characters from Popular stuff, it actually helps to portray Pink as a lost creature, though it´s obvious that this Film is the personal Project of Roger Waters.
The only problem in general, are the more grounded moments of the film and the tendecy to reuse scenes, this also means cutting some of the animations from the Show (Waiting for the Worms just has the Marching Hammers, when it also had a segments of the Hammers in a small British Town, this was changed to Live Action Material) and some of the scenes that dont really add up (After What shall we do now, there´s a scene that doesnt really match with the tone of the film or the visuals, after that until ""One of my Turns"" the movie really hits the breaks)
This film is really a hit or miss, but even so, it´s really an amazing visual and sound spectacle, the animations, the sets, the Wall (Not the album, there´s actually a huge set that is just a Wall that seems endless, it doesnt have anything else, but it really helps to show how huge are Pink´s Mental Problems) the music, the acting, there´s nothing else to say, Watch this film, it´s not the best thing in the universe, but trust me, this isnt another brick in the wall."
"Pink Floyd is, to me, the musical interpretation of arthouse cinema. While their music does, indeed, sound like classic rock you hear on the radio, it has a complexity to it that goes beyond most rock from that era. The Dark of the Moon and The Wall are not albums you'll understand on your first listening unless you go into them having been told what they're about beforehand. That both begin and end in ways that encourage the listener to listen to the album again seems to emphasize to me that the band knew this.The Wall, as a movie, on the other hand, cannot be described so easily. You can call it an extended music video, a musical of sorts, or whatever, but none can fully describe the experience this film provides. This is the type of film that was destined to attain a cult following, and for a good reason: to say this film isn't for everyone is a massive understatement. Calling it a musical gives the impression that the music is sparse but expressive enough to move along the plot, while calling it a music video makes it seem as if it's a vapid experience bereft of any substantial artistic merit. Though it isn't just The Wall for every minute of it's over an-hour-and-a-half runtime, the moments where the pictures aren't being backed by music are few and far between. This film is better described, in my opinion, as an effective companion piece to the album that inspired it. Whether or not you'll enjoy it depends on how you listen to that album. If you see it as music and not the art it's intended to be seen as, there's a fair chance the most you'll get out of this film is a set of surreal images that loosely convey a hard to follow plot. If you listen to Pink Floyd to get stoned, on the other hand... I mean, you clearly aren't here for anything artistic.Either way, The Wall is a haunting, striking, and often times gut wrenching portrayal of loneliness, isolation, childhood abandonment, and madness. Despite not having more than a few lines of dialog, there's something endearing human about the bitter, depressing thematic nature of it all. This is, by all means, a difficult watch -- even for those invested in the material for what I would consider to be 'the right reason'. I don't know if I can honestly say I recommend it, but for those who will probably dig this type of thing, it's certainly something to check out."
"I first saw the wall when I was a teenager, and I was deeply touched by it. The storyline is rather simple: A boy (""Pink"") who loses his father in WWII, becomes dominated by his mother, and as he grows up he starts to gradually become completely isolated from the outside world thus living inside a psychological ""Wall"".Simple the storyline might be, yet the way it is presented is absolutely impressive: The fantastic music is blended perfectly with the story, whereas the live action is immaculately fused with cartoon scenes. The film was created in the early 80's, but it was definitely well ahead of its time.The movie deals with the issues that haunt Pink and finally drive him into madness: The death of his father, his dominant mother, the problematic relationship with his wife. On the same time, the movie critiques the weaknesses of the system in general: Education that produces fools, war that devastates societies, broken relationships, drugs, fascism, and others. It is amazing though that all these are shown in context in which there are few conversations, but much (and beautiful) music instead.In my opinion, one cannot the grasp the movie by watching it once. There are frequent flash-backs, and since the story is presented in the special way that I explained above, it needs at least a second viewing in order to comprehend it fully. Moreover, it is a movie that is not made for the ""mass"" audience, as it is something between a video-clip, a social movie, and an independent production. For those prepared to see something different though, this is a must-see."
"When I saw PINK FLOYD'S THE WALL,I was mesmerised by alot of the images. However alot of them are quite disturbing. The most disturbing sene is the final animated sequence(in my opinion anyway).And the best sene is the ""Another Brick in the Wall"" sequence,trust me.Defenitly not for all tastes.Pink Floyd fans will love it."
"This film is an audio-visual tour-de-force, even for Alan Parker.Together with designer Gerald Scarfe and, of course, Roger Waters, Parker has produced an absolute gem of a movie.
Eschewing the stale concert footage of so many rock films, the trio, instead, put together a coherent montage consisting of skilfully-directed live action sequences interspersed with weird, sometimes grotesque, animations, all overlaid with the unmistakable Floydian sound.Most of the songs are from the best-selling double album but there are one or two that are to be found only on this soundtrack.
Parts of the film must have been harrowing to direct; in the Fascist sequences, forexample, Parker decided to employ bona fide skinheads!
And it was a treat to watch Saint Bob; he'll never win an Oscar but it makes a change seeing a musician play a musician.
It's been said before but a word of caution: you really have to be in the right frame of mind for this film. ""Not necessarily stoned"", as Hendrix said, ""just beautiful"". In other words, this is not for the terminally-depressed or the suicidally-inclined; even Pink himself(someone once called him Roger 'Troubled' Waters) found it heavy going."
"One can either type paragraph upon paragraph about The Wall, or just a a short passage about it.  I'll choose the latter.  This film is simply incredible.  It is extremely disturbing, but wonderfully done, and of course has an amazing soundtrack. 
As another comment put it ""This film deserves your undivided attention.""  That sums it up perfectly.  This is a film to take lightly. Extremely thought-provoking movie."
"A beautiful and haunting portrait of the isolation of the human psyche, 'Pink Floyd The Wall' should forever be recognized as not only a great film, but surely one of the greatest literary contributions of the 20th century. I have only seen this film once and still its impact lingers.
There are so many levels that this movie can be taken on. It can be taken simply as a biography of a disturbed rock star, but for many viewers, it holds much more than that. One thing that many viewers realize after watching and listening to the album intently is that we are all intended to relate to Pink. His is not a singular case of psychosis. Indeed, he represents all of humanity. We all have our walls, his was just larger. We are all afraid on some level of being exposed before our peers. His defense of being so exposed isolated him and drove him insane. The film is a lesson that we should be careful when building our walls that we do not cut ourselves off as Pink did.
Another way to take the movie is as a way of hypothesizing about the rationales in WWII. In the movie and the album, there are undeniable references to the war and the Holocaust. ""Vera Lynn,"" ""In the Flesh,"" and ""The Trial"" are all songs in which direct Holocaust referencing is used. Perhaps Hitler had a wall as well?
Of course, there are a myriad interpretations and levels upon which the film can be viewed. I hope that for years to come, no one forgets this film and the lasting impression it leaves."
"The film, and the album, is a personal autobiography of Roger Waters' life, the loss of his father Eric Fletcher Waters, the hypocrisy of the world we live in, and the isolation of being a rock star. The film is the next step up from the album, you know the lyrics, you've been to the show, now let's tell you what it all means, and if you still don't get it, you never really understood or cared on what we was trying to say in the first place. I thought Bob Gedolf was a brilliant choice, though I wished that the director hadn't let him sing In the Flesh parts 1 and 2, which he totally ruined. I also missed some of the songs which were not in the film such as Hey You and The show must go on, but there were some added bonus' which I wish were on the album such as, When The Tigers Broke Free, and Empty Spaces, and I loved the movie version of Mother, which gave it that sinister feel than the album, I wish they released The Wall album again but in it's entirety. I love the film, the animation is excellent, it complements the album, now all I hope for now is they do a movie based on the album The Darkside of the Moon."
"Art-rock group Pink Floyd's mammoth best-selling album ""The Wall"" is visualized by talented filmmaker Alan Parker, with live-action and animation fleshing out a rather loosely-hinged story of rock 'n roll madness. Bob Geldof looks perpetually wounded and benumbed as the rock star who rose from a harrowing childhood in working class England to his present drug-induced state, complete with hangers-on, sex and self-mutilation. He finds this all an empty, soul-destroying experience--and, after 90 minutes of slithering, often excruciating imagery, so did I. Pink Floyd's music is certainly moving and disturbing, and many of Parker's visuals do compliment the songs (he has an uncanny grasp of personal demons and how to bring them to life), but the attempt at formulating actual characters from the concept is a failure. *1/2 from ****"
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw this at the movie theater when it was originally released. It was so bad I had to leave the theater. I have never done that, even during Flash Gordon. I waited until about 90% of the movie was done but I couldn't take anymore. This movie toppled my other worst movie of all time, Ride in a Pink Car, as the worst.Do not. I repeat do not take your children to this. If your children want you to rent this then you need to have them tested for drug use. I can see where a small minority of 20 something pot smokers would enjoy this movie as a way to get high, etc. but for everyone else don't waste your time and money. If you do want a good movie for getting high or drunk and watching I would suggest Train Spotting. Much better.I sort of like Pink Floyd and I couldn't stand this movie.My favorite part is the animinated dancing vagina's."
"I guess all Pink Floyd fans are praising this film because they enjoy watching a visualization of their favourite songs. If I had listened to the album first (and it would definetely take quite a few listenings to get into it), I am sure I would have liked the movie. I respect both Alan Parker's work and Pink Floyd's music in general, yet I found this movie utterly boring; in addition, the symbolisms are too simplistic and the messages that got through to me are all too heard-before. Maybe it would have worked better if it had been made as a unique project from the start - maybe then the music would have served the images. Because now it seems that the images serve the music - it doesn't happen the other way around simultaneously.I wouldn't dare comment on music that hasn't ""grown"" on me, but the film as a whole told me very little.3"
"From my point of view - The Wall was, pretty much, just a mindlessly meandering, 90-minute rock video, showcasing the finger-pointing rantings & ravings of a whiny, self-destructive pop star named Mr. ""Pink"" Floyd, who turned out to be a delusional pothead seriously addicted to TV.Haunted by unhappy childhood memories, ""Pink"" (clearly an unbalanced Neo-Nazi wannabe) shaves off his eyebrows and inevitably loses his already precarious grip on reality.In spite of some impressive, in-your-face imagery, I'd say that the viewer would have to be well-beyond the ""comfortably numb"" stage to take The Wall's ""We-Don't-Need-No-Education/We-Don't-Need-No-Thought-Control"" nonsense at face value.When it came to utterly dry and humorless storytelling, The Wall certainly delivered its little tale of modern-day madness in aces.With its screenplay written by none other than Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd), I'd say that this dude definitely bit off more than he could chew with the likes of such a heavy-handed project as this.And when it comes to director Alan Parker, I think that if this guy had any rational sense he would've steered clear of this inevitable ""train wreck"" and tackled a more promising production.Yes, folks - ""The child has grown. The dream is gone."""
"I never liked the 1979 double vinyl album , to begin with. Mine always were The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, Meddle, Wish You Were Here, The Final Cut... musically, The Wall is overblown, pompous, pretentious, slick, pathetic, empty and painful. The film is much worse. Bob Geldof may be a great singer as he was with his immortal The Boomtown Rats, but here he is so weak, limp and thin. He cannot reproduce the differing of a mad man, and his voice struggles to convey bombastic Waters' songs. The film is so sickly gory and slow that I started yawning after 20 minutes. Of course, the sequence with singing kids in Another Brick In The Wall is the best, but please, this is only some 10-minutes break in the whole dull, vapid, tormenting lava of sick pictures, blood, wail, and so on. I do not like the film as it never gave me anything to think about. The Daddy of Mr. Roger Waters was killed. That made Roger suffer and I can understand that. But should we suffer, too?"
This movie is not the best movie in the world but it is good enough to give 10 stars. The best thing about this movie is the music when my uncle went to go see it when it was in the theatre he could hear himself think it was that loud and there was only 2 speakers that means just enough sound so you can hear the movie. Yes there is not much talking in this movie but you don't need the words to get what the movie is about the music will explain that to you. bob geldof is a really good actor and this was his only movie the story is good most of the girls are really hot and that is another point why the movie is good but mostly it is the music.This is why i give it 10 out of 10 stars.
"So many of the reviews here said things like 'best film ever.' Some people don't see many movies. This film fails on many different levels & I won't get to them all. For starters Bob Geldof's acting is so horribly, embarrassingly bad. It's laughable. It's clear that he is out of his element and has no idea what he doing as an actor. But of course the film is such a muddled mess, Geldof's amateurish acting is sometimes hidden. For those of you who say you love this movie go back and focus just on Geldof. I've done this & find myself giggling at him. The director knows Geldof has no range, so there are often a series of fast cover edits so Geldof is not on screen very long. Because Geldof is so atrocious and not believable, the film is a mockery and dishonest.Just because some people saw this film in altered state as teenagers, and liked it, doesn't make it a good movie. Think about it.On the other hand the album is great on so many levels. But when I think of this music in conjunction with the movie, it doesn't seem as good. The music literally becomes cartoonish, a caricature which I think is ashame. The familiar themes the film tries to cover have been conveyed in more thoughtful and creative ways elsewhere.The playwright Samuel Beckett had the habit of never talking about his writing, his art – he left it for people to interpret it themselves & come to their own conclusions. I feel that Pink Floyd would been better served in this case to let the music speak for itself. The movie is a distraction from the real art."
Worst movie I have ever seen.  Listening to the plight of the central character was like listening to fingernails on a blackboard!  The only people suffering more than the central character were the poor sods like me watching this complete rubbish!  Too bad you can't vote minus ten...
"We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden ""turn"" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show.The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album ""The Wall"", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts."
"Well, I finally saw this film. I knew even before I saw it that it was going to be a collage of Roger Waters imagery for the Album ""The Wall"". I knew it was going to feel forced, too. I like a a good deal of Pink Floyd. I can handle obscene and bizarre imagery and whatnot, in fact, I love it. It wasn't as extreme as I expected (it was quite mild), but I believe you can't make a good bizarre film using forced and often stupid weird things. Roger Waters was hoping David Lynch would like this film, considering ""Eraserhead"" is known for being one of his favorites. Well, Lynch doesn't like interpretations for films and since this entire movie is an interpretation of the album, you get the point. To sum it all up, this a stupid film that COULD ruin the album for you and this film is not complex, even if there is some hidden meaning behind it (who cares, anyway)."
"This movie outright sucked. I watched it once while I was sober, I saw all the symbolism, I understood it fully, and it sucked. I thought maybe I had to get stoned to see it, so I smoked some THC, sat down and watched it, and it was just hilarious. Just like anything on pot. The point of this movie is really quite easy to see (tear down the Berlin wall), and there's nothing special about that kind of message. I may have not enjoyed that movie because i'm not the most avid of Floyd fans, but I know a couple of people who absolutely adored this movie, and they aren't Floyd fans either.So, I give this movie a 1, because it sucks, stoned or sober."
"The Wall is an amazing in depth album about how aspects of his life leads to creating a social barrier between himself and the rest of the world. Someone that doesn't know much about the album would find it very difficult to follow along as there is some seriously powerful psychedelic sequences, but if you can understand them then the movie should be very enjoyable. In my own opinion Pink Floyd are my favorite band with the only close runner up being David Bowie and I'm not one of those guys that thinks ""The 80's music is better than everything every made"" however Pink Floyd as a fact are one of the greatest bands ever and the film is a great representative of their musical talents. I give it a 10 because the film is so unique that I haven't seen anything like it and the messages behind it are extremely powerful, I love the way they reference previous albums and one in the future."
"In 1977, during Pink Floyd's ""In The Flesh"" tour Roger Waters replied with anger to an excited group of fans who were making trouble during the concert and as result he spat in one people of the group. After that Roger felt that a wall was built between he and the public, and that incident became the concept of Pink Floyd's future album The Wall, released in 1979. The album was a huge hit, and some of their great classics songs were present in that album such as ""Another Brick in the Wall"", ""Run Like Hell"", ""Comfortably Numb"" and many others. But the story doesn't end here. In 1982, Roger wrote an screenplay based on the album's songs and once again the concept was the wall dividing the artist and the crowd. Finally Alan Parker was brought to direct ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" in what later he would call as ""the most expensive student film ever made."" To explain the story of the movie is to reduce its greatness, its magical moments, the metaphorical aspects of such a masterpiece yet to be understood. With almost no kind of dialogs and filled with Pink Floyd's songs, the movie tells the story of Pink, a depressed rock star (played by The Boomtown Rats lead singer Bob Geldof), cloistered in a hotel room, or as he thinks, a wall that kept him safe of everything and everyone. The movie then flashes back to Pink's childhood during the war years when his father died, his repressed school days (the ""Another Brick in the Wall"" moment), and then move forward to his marriage with an groupie, his rock n'roll days, and his Neo-Nazi hallucinations when Pink thinks he's a leader of a Nazi group (their symbol is a hammer) that eliminates ethnic minorities. In short, it is the rise and fall of Pink's metaphorical wall and the way he deals with it. When I watched it five years ago I wasn't a Pink Floyd fan and I only watched because it was an Alan Parker film and people said that this was an acclaimed film. I watched it, enjoyed most of it, really liked it but I didn't understood almost anything of what this movie was about. Then I watched again and I really felt that this is really a very good film, very enjoyable, one of those movies that it only gets better the more you watch over and over again. It's a work that leaves the audience takes their own conclusions about the story through images, animations, and of course, the great poetry present in the musics. It's an experience like everything involving Pink Floyd but it's also a cinematic experience for anyone who enjoys movies. Some people may leave it after a few minutes because it's not an conventional movie with a developed storyline, it has many flashbacks, it is more like an long video clip but with a story. Those who doesn't like metaphors, ideological concepts stay out and go watch ""Scary Movie"". But if you're an Pink Floyd fan watch it, and even better buy it if you can. To see the songs along with the incredible music of David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason and Roger Waters is an very pleasant experience. You're definitely going to sing along with the movie. The best scenes in the movie are: the animated sequence when it's played ""Goodbye Blue Sky"" (remind me of Todd McFarland's work); Pink being rescued by medics and his manager (Bob Hoskins), the song played is ""Comfortably Numb""; ""Run Like Hell"" played in the Nazi attacks; Pink remembering strange moments with his mother (the song played is ""Mother"")and the most awaited scene, the huge hit ""Another Brick in the wall"", when Pink's at the school being insulted by the teacher because he writes poems (the song ""Money"") during class. This scene is very well-known because later MTV would used as the official video for the song back in 1980's. It may not have any great performances, and it's visual sets will remind you of ""A Clockwork Orange"", but it's a wonderful movie. Highly recommended as one of Alan Parker's masterpieces along with ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""The Commitments"". I hope that someday someone transforms Pink Floyd's album ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" into a movie. That would be excellent! 10/10"
