"Last year I was very lucky to catch this on the big screen. This film is meant to be seen on the big screen! It was also the first time I saw it at the theaters and I was very impressed with the visuals.In this film movies are switching over from being silent to being ""talkies"". However the film is a spoof of the turmoil that afflicted the movie industry in the late 1920s when movies when the change over went from silent to sound. When two silent movie stars', Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, latest movie is made into a musical a chorus girl is brought in to dub Lina's speaking and singing. Don is on top of the world until Lina finds out.This is such a great film that if you ever get the chance to see this at the movies then DO IT.Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds made an awesome team."
"Can you imagine? Me, a film lover since the age of six, hadn't seen ""Singing In The Rain"" until last night. I had read and heard so much about it over the years that I knew I was going to be disappointed. As a musical I've never seen anything so perfectly ""in tune"" I can see how many directors have been influenced by the soul of this gorgeous movie. I've seen even Federico Fellini here. The tap routine with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor is so energizing that I wanted to see it again and again. The fantasy number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse is breathtaking, breathtaking! How extraordinary to see Debiee Reynolds going through the contagious (Good morning!Good morning!) I had seen her a few nights before as Grace's mother in ""Will and Grace"" She hasn't lost her zest. I'm sure I'll be seeing this movie many times and I intend to show it to very young people from the post MTV generation and I'm betting with myself that they're going to love it. Greatness is timeless."
"Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song & dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in ""The Nanny"" (1993).Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.But the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and d√©nouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor's careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.But Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they're showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.Donen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended ""Broadway Rhythm Ballet"" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it's just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the ""Singing in the Rain"" sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly's umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, ""rain"" is pouring down on him.While there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD. If you're relatively unfamiliar with classic Hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start."
"I don't like musicals. They never made any sense to me. Don't get me wrong, I love music; it's an important part of my life. I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I'm repelled. It's probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, ""Please don't take us seriously, we like to sing and dance."" Or even more ridiculous, ""Let's not fight, let's settle this dispute with a song and dance."" Forget about suspension of disbelief.This film however, I manage to enjoy. I once was given the task of my film teacher to watch the film and keep track of all the cuts in the film. Well, sometime after ten minutes I lost track because I was so wrapped up in the story. It really is an interesting period in the history of cinema, told well, and with well placed song and dance numbers that at times drag on, but that seems to be more of an excuse to show off the technicolour than anything else. They build you up to it slowly. The first few numbers don't break out at an inappropriate time. It doesn't last though, but by then they've got you.With such memorable tunes as these, it's hard to imagine them going wrong. When Gene Kelly sings the title piece, somehow time stands still as you're swept up in one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Just reading the title in print has likely caused you to hum a few bars, or sing a few words. Or maybe, just maybe, walk out without an umbrella when you know it's raining. One thing's for sure, if all Gene Kelly did was choreograph the dance numbers, he more than deserves the co-directing credit he has.They simply don't make films like this anymore. Which in some ways is a testament to the film's theme and narrative. The business of show is constantly in a state of evolution. The narrative portrays a time period when silent films were being replaced by ""talkies"" with sound, yet the musical genre itself has almost all but disappeared with the exception of animated films with musical numbers, and rare live-action pieces.One might speculate that Hollywood overdid the musical. Personally, I can't get into them. Most of the time it seems like a drawn out affair, but this film is something special. Considering my feelings about musicals, it would have to take a film of this one's caliber to make me sit up and take notice."
"The transition from the silent film era to the newly arrived technique of the 'talkies' proved to be the ruin for many well established stars that were great on the screen, but who had no professional training in the theater, or otherwise, and had horrible speaking voices. Thus, a star of the magnitude of Lina Lamont, suffers a hard blow to her career and ego.That's the basis of one of the best movies about old Hollywood of all times: ""Singin' in the Rain"". The film is one of the classics it is because of the marvelous direction of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, two men who knew a lot about musicals. The screen play is by one of the best people in the business, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.MGM was the studio that employed all the stars one sees in the film, and what a cast they put together: Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Cyd Charisse in a dancing part, Millard Mitchell and Rita Moreno. As if those names weren't big enough, there is the fantastic musical numbers that even, viewing them today, have kept their freshness because of the care in which this film was crafted.""Singin' in the Rain"" is one of the best musicals of all times. It's right up there with the best of them thanks to the vision of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and it will live forever as more people discover this wonderful example of entertainment."
"Singin' in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made. The film is beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it's a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they're referring to.The star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O'Connor makes the most of his ""second banana"" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ing√©nue trying to break into films. The three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" classic; all three in the ""Good Mornin'"" number; O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh""; and Kelly and Reynolds in ""You Were Meant for Me."" The masterpiece however may be the ""Gotta Dance"" production number with Kelly and Cyd Charisse¬ójust perfect. Also great fun are O'Connor and Kelly in ""Fit as a Fiddle"" and ""Moses Supposes.""There are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood's race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the ""Beautiful Girl"" number featuring Jimmy Thompson. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.The great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly ""lip syncing"" for Hagen, it's really Hagen's voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the ""I Would, Would You"" number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing ""Singin' in the Rain"" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can't tell who is lip syncing whose voice.Lots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen's Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It's also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams ""I LOVE YOU"" it's a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman's diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.A great film!"
"This isn't my all time favorite (that goes to ""Meet me in St. Louis"") but this is definitely in the top 10. This is a fictitous musical comedy of the 1920s when silent films became ""talkies"". It chronicles how it affects Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), his leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) and Lockwood's new girlfriend Kathey Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Problem is Lina has a voice that can cut glass and doesn't like lockwood falling for Selden...This movie has one highlight after another. Almost all the numbers are great--the title tune, ""Make 'Em Laugh"", ""Beautiful Girl"", ""Good Morning"" on and on. My two favorites are two short ones: ""Fit as a Fiddle"" which has incredible dancing from Kelly and O'Connor and ""Would You?"" at the end. Kelly isn't that good acting (he never was) but his dancing is superb; Reynolds (only 19 when she did this) is beautiful, energetic and full of life; Hagen is uproarious as Lamont (she was nominated for an Academy Award--she should have won!) and O'Connor is just great as Cosmo (his ""Make Em' Laugh"" number has astounding dancing). It's hard to believe that Reynolds and O'Connor hated working with Kelly (he was obnoxious, VERY demanding and a tyrant)--it's a credit to their acting that it never comes through.I only have one (small) complaint--the big, elaborate production number with Cyd Charisse in the middle. It LOOKS great and colorful--but it brings the film to a screeching halt and is way too long. After it ends I have trouble remembering where the film left off! Still, that's a small problem. This remains one of the 10 best movie musicals ever made. HIGHLY recommended!"
"One thing I noticed in reading the comments of this movie is that nobody recognized the screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Without their screenplay the movie does not get made. It is a great script that was made better by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donens' fluid direction. Everything in this movie glides effortlessly. Throw in dancing by Donald O'connor, Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse and of course Gene Kelly, Great songs and the willingness of producer Arthur Freed to let the creative people to do their thing and you have a classic."
"Many good things can be and have been said about this one and they're all true.  It's a great movie.  The title number gives us Don Lockwood (Kelly)...In love as no other person has ever been in love, no doubt.  He steps out the door and it's raining but he's oblivious to the rain.  Who needs an umbrella when you've got wings on your heart and on your feet? Not the incomparable Gene Kelly as he treats us to THE single finest moment in the history of cinema.  Do not miss this one."
"Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have produced the best musical written directly for the screen. They have used the period in film history during the transition to sound movies and embroidered it with the wonderful songbook of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The icing on the cake, of course is the choreography of Kelly and Donen. From the first moment, the movie takes flight as Kelly relates the tale of his rise as a silent film star with his sidekick, the incomparable Donald O'Connor. Watch the flying feet of O'Connor and Kelly in the ""Fit as a Fiddle"" number. It doesn't get much better than this. Everyone is familiar with the classic ""Singin' in the Rain"" sequence. Donald O'Connor's hysterical ""Make 'em Laugh"" number is probably the funniest musical three minutes on film. Even the Broadway Ballet is a kaleidoscope of color and movement, with a minimum of the highbrow balletic choreography found in the later ""An American in Paris.""What makes ""Singin'"" such an entertaining classic is its superb integration of comedy and music. Jean Hagen gives the performance of her life as the vocally challenged silent film star, Lena Lamont. Every scene she's in is a comic gem. Her ""fingernails on a blackboard"" voice and massacre of the English language make her a figure of ridicule. However, in the end when she finally gets her comeuppance, one can't help feeling a little sorry for her.This delightful film has been given its due on video. On VHS it can be purchased with the complete remastered soundtrack on CD. The laserdisc versions include one with commentary by film historian Ronald Haver (Criterion) and the film-only version from MGM/UA Home Video with a restored Dolby Digital stereo soundtrack., Last,but not least,is a masterful rendering on DVD with, unfortunately, no supplementary material to speak of.This is truly a film for all time that can be watched just for its entertainment value and studied as probably the apex of the Hollywood musical in its Golden Age."
"This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like ""Singin' in the Rain.""There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (""She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!"") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (""Fit as a Fiddle,"" ""Good Mornin'"").Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to ""You Were Meant for Me."" Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.Great stuff!If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it!PS: In the ""rent-this-too"" category, if you've seen and love ""Singin' in the Rain,"" check out ""The Band Wagon."" It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!"
"Singing In The Rain is to me the greatest musical ever made, sure many others push it close, The Wizard Of Oz for one will always be a 10/10 movie in my opinion, but Singing In The Rain is a film that has no flaws, it is a perfect movie.Don Lockwood is a star of silent movies but his life is boring, then talking movies arrive and with them he eyes an opportunity to greatly improve his life. A chance encounter with dancer Kathy Selden will further shape his destiny, and along with best pal and partner Cosmo Brown, their respective fortunes will hopefully dovetail towards fulfillment.Where do you start? The film is a homage to happiness, be it film making or love, or friendships and honour, the film is pure and simply joyous from the first reel to the triumphant last shot. Featuring stunning choreography, Singing In The Rain doesn't cop out by merely having characters plodding thru a script and then bursting into song occasionally, each song furthers the characters and fleshes out the story unfolding to keep the plot lines tight and crucially, important.Make 'Em Laugh, Good Morning, and Singing In The Rain are just some of the brilliant songs and dance routines on show here, with the latter a now legendary piece of cinematic history that speaks volumes for the joyous nature of the film, whilst the finale sequence of the 'Broadway Ballet' is magic & elegance personified. The cast are uniformly excellent, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor & Debbie Reynolds interplay together like they were hatched from the same egg, and the joint direction from Stanley Donen (along with Kelly) is seamless.Full of hat tipping and self-referencing winks, Singing In The Rain regularly hits the top ten lists of critics and movie fans alike, so lets not beat around the bush about it...it flipping well deserves it. 10/10 in every respect."
"I'm going to confine my comments about ""Singin' in the Rain"" to the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence where Cyd Charisse steals the movie without saying a word. In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.Many have said that the two numbers in ""Singin' in the Rain"" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know¬Ö as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the ""crazy veil"" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a ""Word of Mouth"" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion¬ónot as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.Wonderful."
"Everybody knows Gene Kelly singing and dancing in the films title number, but this is just one of the many magical musical numbers in this epic piece of blissful entertainment. Set during the turbulent period when Hollywood was converting from silent films to sound, ¬ëSingin' in the Rain' is a perfect example of everything that is good and right about movie-making. Gene Kelly in his greatest role is an all singing, all dancing sensation and his acting is pretty damn good too. Donald O'Connor excels as his exuberant sidekick and almost steals the show with the unsurpassed ¬ëMake ¬ëem Laugh'. Debbie Reynolds is feisty and sexy as Kelly's love interest, while Jean Hagen gives one of the screen's greatest supporting performances as the horrid Lena Lamont, a silent screen goddess whose voice will just not cut it in talkies.The musical numbers flow fast and furious as Gene and Donald perform amazing feats of choreography with ¬ëFit as a Fiddle' and ¬ëMoses Supposes' while ¬ëGood Mornin' will have you dancing in the aisles. If ¬ëSingin' in the Rain' had no musical numbers it would still be a contender for the funniest film ever made. The problems with experiments with sound films are painfully funny, and Kelly's silent sparring with the demonic Hagen is hilarious. The accolade of sheer perfection can be conferred on few films, and such a title is perhaps even an understatement in this case. And never before did rain look like so much fun."
"This is one of those handful of films that is universally loved and respected and I have to join the crowd on that. For over 50 years it has been considered the best musical ever made and I can't argue with that, either, especially with the newly- restored DVD version that came out a short time ago. The film never looked and sounded better!In a nutshell, the reason for the high praise, I would think would be: 1 - Likable lead characters (Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor); 2 - Excellent song-and-dance numbers, capped off by one of the most famous of all-time, the title song ""Singin' In the Rain,"" featuring Kelly; 3 - Very good humor throughout the film, aided by Jean Hagen's dumb blonde imitation, which may be the best ever put on film; 4 - Spectacular color (please get this latest 2-disc DVD), and 5 - of course, simply a very entertaining film start-to-finish.A few side comments: Kelly gets the legacy with his title song dance but O'Connor's dancing in here is just as good. In fact, one of his solo routines reportedly exhausted him so much he could not work for five days. A nice bonus is seeing Cyd Charisse in here, showing off her dancing skills and great legs."
"It has long been thought that the musical era was born out of pure enthusiasm over the ability to put sound on film.  And while the case holds water, it is not entirely correct.  As `Singin' In the Rain,' so eloquently shows; comedy, charm, music, and dance can all be featured successfully within one film.`Singin In the Rain,' is also generally known as the greatest musical of all time.  Roger Ebert, the late Gene Siskel, Leonard Maltin, and many other prominent critics agree with that opinion.  The plot was born from a song and used others that had been around for many years, ever since `the talkies' were born in the late 20s.  The screenplay was written according to the songs.  Although the cast had been cast,  and re-cast several times; the end result was one of perfect chemistry.  The combination of the ever-so talented Gene Kelly (arguably 1 of the 2 best film dancers ever) and Debbie Reynolds worked very well, despite complications that arose off the set. And Donald O'Connor was born for his role as Cosmo Brown, the best buddy to Kelly's Don Lockwood.  His wit keeps the film fresh and funny.  If you took a drink for every smart remark he made, you'd be drunk, before Lockwood gets the girl!All the characters in this film are dynamic, save Cosmo Brown and Lena Lamont (played by Jean Hagen).  This was perfect for what was called for, for this film to succeed.  This helps the film `move,' where other musicals fail.  This is where the irony enters; since this film was written in reverse of this philosophy.  Being able to incorporate quality songs into a quality storyline is a skill no studio has ever mastered, even to this day. Even, MGM, which was known as `the king of the musicals', failed more often than it succeeded.  To this day, no one has mastered it; although Disney has almost reached MGM proportions with its animation department.As the film opens, the premiere for one of the famed `Lockwood/Lamont' films is taking place for `The Royal Rascal.' As the stars arrive, one by one, Cosmo Brown arrives.  A bit later Lockwood and Lamont arrive. Lockwood tells a `story' of how he and Cosmo get to stardom.  To celebrate the release, there is a party at the studio's producer's house.  But to get there, Lockwood must go by a different rout than everyone else, finding Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) in the process.  After a few cute surprises and accidents, Don gets a conscience attack.  After finally finding her, he realizes that he cares for her.  Meanwhile, Cosmo Brown keeps up his antics and funny nature.  The comic relief is never amiss in this film.  Lamont soon learns of the romance and is up to something, but what?  What do you think she is, `.dumb or something?'The co-director (also co-directed by Gene Kelly) Stanley Donen called the `Moses Supposes' dance sequence with Kelly and  O'Connor, the best dance sequence ever.  I agree that it is in the Top 3, but not the best, that's in another film; which Donen directed, for another review.  All numbers in this film are memorable, where most from other films are not.There is only one detraction in this film.  It is the `Broadway Melody' sequence.  It begins with another interesting and amusing song and dance number by Mr. Lockwood, trying to convince his producer of something.  But the scene becomes too long and unnecessary.  Cyd Charisse is an amazing talent, but the dance number she has in the film, should have been deleted. It is mesmerizing, but is out of place in this film.  This 13 minute sequence should have ended at about 7-8 max.  Still, this detail is so minute, that it isn't a bad detraction. When this film was released in 1952, it opened to luke-warm reviews and average box office receipts.  It wasn't until it's `10th Anniversary,' that people began to notice that `Singin' In the Rain' was special and has been known as such ever since.  The AFI, when it released it's list of `The 100 Greatest Films Ever,' ranked this film No.10, to put it at the highest mark for a musical of any era and place Ms. Debbie Reynolds as half of the only mother/daughter combination on the list*.  `Singin' In the Rain,' is always fun to watch, the film has also been recently released on DVD with tons of extras.  As enduring as Mr. Kelly's lamppost lean is, so this film echoes Mr. Lockwood's sentiments of nothing; nothing but pure joy that is.Personal Rating: 99 on a 100 point scale*Note-Ms. Reynolds' daughter, Carrie Fisher appeared in AFI's No. 15 film, `Star Wars.'"
"""Singin' In the Rain"" I find to be a relaxed musical, one whose subject is the traumatic changeover that was faced by Hollywood producers, actors and directors when sound was introduced into film circa 1928. Many fans and critics believe the musical is one of the best ever; I disagree. But it is quite unusual in several respects, I suggest: first because its background is so realistic as a milieu from which to draw appealing characters and opportunities to introduce songs; and second because the film is played on the edge of parody without ever really falling into that error. The three characters at the center of the film are a love triangle. Don Lockwood, played amiably by Gene Kelly, is the on-screen partner of Lina Lamont (Oscar-worthy Jean Hagen); she has mistaken his sincere performance for real interest; he is in love with Kathy Selden, played by too-young but plucky nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds, about whom Lina knows nothing. The professional duo are completing one more romantic adventure film as a silent when suddenly sound is introduced into movies. The studio executives panic; and Don and his partner, played by Donald O'Connor, convince the director, craggy-faced and very realistic Douglas Fowley, to get the studio to let them remake the film as a musical--completing the unfinished portion, etc. The problem turns out not to be Don's transition to talkies but Lina's; she has the voice of a screech owl. Coaching becomes necessary; sensational dance numbers are introduced, including Kelly's solo ""Singin' in the Rain"", motivated by his falling in love with Kathy; Donald O'Connor's ""Make 'Em Laugh"" acrobatic classic; and the unnecessary but very-well-done ""Gotta Dance"" showcase ballet with Cyd Charisse as a gangster's moll, and Kelly as a Broadway hopeful. Then, the film is completed and debuted; of course Lina has found out about Kathy. And of course this intelligent satire works out well for all concerned, after some trials and tribulations. Great fun is gotten I suggest from the actors having to learn to ""talk into the flowers"", where early microphones had to be hidden, etc. Harold Rosson provided the cinematography, with art direction by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons. Nacio Herb Brown's songs were intelligently recycled for the film. Arthur Freed, MGM's master musical specialist, had the use of the talents of Betty Comden and Adolph Green for the screenplay and one song, ""Moses Supposes""; he also had then-28- year-old nice guy Stanley Donen as director, soon to add ""On The Town"" and ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" to this triumph. Walter Plunkett did the period costumes, with complex set decorations being done by Jacques Mapes and Edwin B. Willis. The studio's boss was played by Millard Mitchell, with Rita Moreno and a dozen familiar faces in smaller parts and uncredited appearances such as Joi Lansing, Paul Maxey, Sylvia Lewis, Kathleen freeman, King Donovan, Dawn Addams, Elaine Edwards, Mae Clarke and Snub Pollard. The film was influential, I assert, my criterion for including it among these reviews, because, immediately afterward, other 1920s and period projects were inspired by its success; these included, ""Has Anybody Seen My Gal"", the TV show ""So This is Hollytwood"", and ultimately ""The Great Race"", ""The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond Story"" and a hundred others, including a few musicals. I consider it to be genial, a clever period evocation, lightweight, exuberant, youthful, and a very seminal work with a strong central character and unusually-interesting reality background."
"Spoilers herein.This is a nearly perfect film from my perspective: It feels naturally improvised. Its episodes are radically discontinuous, but feel like fluid transitions. It has some great numbers, including the incomparable Cyd Charisse.But what really puts this on my `must see' list is the deep self-reference. Superficially, it is a movie about a movie, but actually the folding is a whole lot more complex, even psychedelic. The narrative structure is flashbacks, flashforwards, about the movie, IS the movie, about the fooling behind the movie (oddly, Debbie's non-movie songs were dubbed by someone else!). It has nested abstractions, and encompassing ones. It has several manner of annotative features. And the internal movie itself grows while we watch to have internal nesting of different types: the original costume drama becomes a vision from a modern newcomer whacked on the head. And further, there is the Charisse number which is another abstraction.
There were precessors: `Kane' (41) introduced the use of many parallel narrative devices, `Children of Paradise' (45) had conflated reality and performance: `Red Shoes' (48) took it to dance, and those are must see as well. But here, the technique becomes visual jazz improvisations on reality. Thrilling.None of the people involved ever came close on other projects. Odd.Ted's evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this."
"""Singin' in the Rain"" could be considered on the top of movie musicals... It is fresh, imaginative and enjoyable...Arthur Freed wrote the lyrics to the songs and they were excellent, specially the title number ""Singin' in the Rain"" which Stanley Kubrick repeated it in his black comedy ""A Clockwork Orange,"" in 1971...But the mysterious power of ""Singin' in the Rain"" remains in the script, written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green whose sprightly adaptation were also shown in musicals like ""On the Town,"" ""It Always Fair Weather,"" and ""Bells Are Ringing."" The film is a brilliant musical, the best picture by far of Hollywood in transition...It is a gentle satire on the movie modes and manners of the twenties, put together around the problem that faced several actors and studios in their transition from silent films to talkies... This transition is in reality horror and shock to several film stars who failed for not having enough way of speaking, effective word order between image and voice...""Singin' in the Rain"" is the story of a wildly funny sex goddess played by Jean Hagen who steals the classic as an aggressive no-talent squeaky-voiced silent-screen goddess forced to use blackmail to keep her star in the Hollywood sky¬Ö Jean was in love with Kelly who wanted to substitute her by the talented chorus girl Debbie Reynolds.. ""Singin' in the Rain"" is rich in the brilliant way in which it is written and done... Its three production numbers are extraordinary, illuminating the picture with different forms of entertainment and bright colors¬Ö The big number 'Broadway Ballet,' is a surrealistic extravaganza filled with magic, huge cast, spectacular use of light, color, costumes and sets, plus a marvelous ballet danced by Kelly and Cyd Charisse...Gene Kelly became legendary as a choreographer and director... With Stanley Donen, in addition to ""Singin' in the Rain,"" he made ""On the Town,"" and ""It's Always Fair Weather."" Taken all together, they are constituent element to surpass most of musical achievement..."
"A perfect movie in every sense, 'Singin In The Rain' has rightly gone down in history as the best musical picture ever. But it is much more than that. A sparkling comedy, with a cast that is 100% perfect, and one of the best movies about movies ever made too.Gene Kelly's genius has never been more apparent than in this movie, but, as always he never steals the show, in fact here practically having the show stolen from him by Donald O'Connor's gravity defying 'Make 'Em Laugh' and Jean Hagen's unforgettable Lina Lamont. Kelly's title number is the epitome of carefree nonchalance. The guy's in love and he isn't going to let a little rain get in the way. This 'classic' scene is possibly the feelgood moment to beat all others. I defy anyone not to succumb to the Kelly's Irish charm during this number, if you haven't already been won over.But a musical is just a musical without a decent story. That's where Comden and Green's pertinent screenplay comes in. Using Nacio Herb Brown's songs from the era in which the movie is set we are taken back to Hollywood in transition, a time when silent movies were ousted by the talkies. For what is generally regarded as just a light-hearted song and dance movie 'Singin In The Rain' takes a pretty accurate line and takes a satirical swipe at the studios and the gossip mongers of the day. There were stars, like Lina Lamont, whose careers disintegrated on the advent of talking pictures, and others, like Kathy Seldon, whose stars were beginning to rise. For a while, there weren't enough voice coaches to go round! The race to match the success of 'The Jazz Singer' was truly chaotic, with studios churning out potboiler after potboiler to cash in on the talking picture. It was also a time when MGM itself started it's reign of the musical genre with epic production numbers, and casts of thousands. In a sense,'Singin In The Rain' both lampoons and celebrates it's own ancestry and place in cinema history.Exhilarating, exuberant, and mesmerising. Still, in my opinion, the most entertaining, and the best, movie ever made!"
"Although it was somewhat overshadowed by An American in Paris in it's time, it is now justifiably considered one of the best Hollywood musicals ever made. It's my favorite musical, Gene Kelly film, and one of my favorite MOVIES.Kelly was without a doubt at the peak of his amazing career as an actor, director, choreographer, and above all dancer. Each scene is dripping with bright, vibrant colors and plenty of laughs. Kelly's class and charm just exudes from the screen.What makes the film so extraordinary is the way each song and dance number flow effortlessly and are perfectly intergrated into the story. These numbers not only showcase the amazing ability of Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and even Debbie Reynolds, but also the exuberance of that happy and carefree feeling of the 1920's.Some of the standout numbers are of course the title dance through the rain, and Broadway Melody, but also the hilarious ""Make Em Laugh"" where O'Connor displays his talent of blending humor and acrebatic movements, and ""Good Morning"" where Reynolds holds her own between the  2 greatest dancers of the time.This film is an American classic and an absolute must see. It's the perfect movie to watch if you want to laugh, smile, or just simply watch something that leaves you with a good feeling. I know I am always left with a glorious feeling in my heart."
"Definitely one of the most genuinely feel-good films I've ever seen. For a musical, it did not fit the mold of being a bit on the corny side. And some musical films I've seen are a bit stale, but this one is far from that label. I was just beginning to see Gene Kelly's work (I had first seen An American in Paris--which is another gem) and I was captivated by his energy and how overall talented he is. Definitely a great dancer of his time. It was also the first film I saw of Debbie Reynolds' earlier work. It is very clear why it's considered one of the best films of all time. It's witty, romantic, charming, and contains beautiful musical numbers. I definitely recommend it to be an addition to anyones film collection."
"Everybody remembers the scene. It's the one where he walks along the street, dancing, and singin' in the rain. The musical sequence has yet to be surpassed by any film -- even my all-time-favorite musical, ""Grease"" (1978), doesn't stand a chance. In fact, there's another great musical number in ""Singin' in the Rain,"" with Donald O'Connor throwing his body around like a rag doll. Even though the singin' in the rain number is the infamous trademark of the film and musicals everywhere, my personal favorite is ""Make 'em Laugh.""Not many people know, however, that Gene Kelly had a 103 degree fever during the filming of the infamous scene -- a dangerous thing to do, in retrospect, considering that he was flailing about and working up a sweat in pouring water with such a high temperature. But even then, not many people know that the ""rain water"" pouring down on the joyously cheesy street was actually composed of water and milk. The milk was added to the mix in an effort to achieve the effect of raindrops showing up on screen. (Mel Gibson noted once that most of the time during the filming of ""Braveheart"" it was raining around them, but it was basically impossible to notice any rainfall in the film since the sheets of liquid were so thin.)""Singin' in the Rain"" can probably be called the greatest musical of all time, even though my guilty pleasure is ""Grease"" (how outdated the film is, and yet how amusing it remains!). Every serious filmgoer knows this movie, and just yesterday as I watched Britain's countdown to the greatest musical ever made, I noted that ""Singin' in the Rain"" was high on the list (""Grease"" was no. 1, although any list that posts ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Musical"" higher on a list than ""Singin' in the Rain"" can't be trusted).Don Lockwood (Kelly) is a silent film star in 1927, an ex-musician living an on-screen romance with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and letting the publicity take their screen relationship to a whole new level (think Ben and Jen's recent tabloid romance). The press loves to think that its two biggest stars are the nation's cutest couple, but in reality Lockwood despises Lamont, and Lamont -- having read trashy magazines -- believes their relationship to be factual. ""Oh, Donny!"" Lina cries. ""You couldn't kiss my like that and not mean it just a teensy bit!"" Lockwood: ""Meet the greatest actor in the world -- I'd rather kiss a tarantula."" Lina: ""You don't mean that."" Lockwood: ""I don't? Hey Joe, get me a tarantula!""When the silent film studio begins the transition from silent film to new ""talkies,"" it means that Lockwood will have to take acting lessons in able to learn to truly be able to act, and Lamont -- a squeaky-voiced young lady -- will have to learn to learn proper grammar. (Some scenes with a grammar instructor reminded me of ""My Fair Lady,"" truth be told, although it was filmed 12 years afterwards.)Lockwood meets a young girl named Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), who refuses to fall victim to his Hollywood charm but eventually learns to love the guy after he gets her out of a tight squeeze or two.Meanwhile, Lockwood's pal, Cosmo (O'Connor), suggests that they start to stage film musicals instead of feature ""talkies"" -- that way, all Lockwood needs to do is sing and dance, something he already excels at. (""Make a musical! The new Don Lockwood: he yodels! He jumps about to music!"")But people want Lockwood and Lamont, not Lockwood by himself, and the prospect of losing money is not a bright prospect for the film company. So Lina is filmed in the musicals with him, and towards the end of our film, sweet young Kathy dubs over Lina's voice and is given no credit for the task. Lamont is too embarrassed to admit that she can't sing, and so she blackmails the film distributor -- if they credit Kathy at the end of her new feature film, she'll take legal action.And so comes the climatic finale on stage as Lockwood reveals the true singer behind the film (ironic, since it was Lamont herself who dubbed over Reynolds' voice during the sequence). As Roger Ebert noted, the scene where Lockwood bursts onto stage and fingers out Kathy from the crowd of onlookers is corny, but it's sweet and exactly the time of emotionally uplifting moment that is rarely made nowadays.Gene Kelly's notorious cruelty on the set of ""Singin' in the Rain"" has become a sort of folklore, and it's true. He berated the actors if they messed up a single dance number. O'Connor later admitted that he was extremely frightened to make a single mistake, afraid that Kelly would lash out at him.That strictness doesn't shine through Kelly's character in ""Singin' in the Rain."" In fact, many of the dance moves (such as the frantic splashing in the puddles) look quite haphazard, but they were all choreographed to an extreme.Is that why the film is highly regarded as perhaps the definitive American musical? That probably has something to do with it. I think it's mostly the joy of it all, though -- bright, cheery, happy, and uplifting, the film is one of the most purely fun films of all time. It doesn't demand anything like some films, but it gives a lot back.The ads for ""Singin' in the Rain"" promised a glorious feeling, and in that way the film lives up to its slogan. It is fun and bright and glorious and entertaining. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it offers the viewer a chance to experience something quite rare -- an all-around great movie.
What a glorious feeling, indeed.5/5."
"There are two kinds of musicals. You can call them different things. You could call them the Hollywood Musical and the Broadway Musical. That's not quite proper because the Hollywood Musical is what the Broadway Musical was in the 20's and 30's, before Rogers and Hammerstein changed everything. maybe a better distinction is the Dancing Musical vs. the Singing Musical, except that both kinds have dancing and singing...Let's try it this way. The original musicals on Broadway in the 20's and 30's and Hollywood in the 30's and 40's were musicals with a slight storyline, some singing and tremendous dancing numbers. They also have low comedy and plenty of beautiful girls. They usually are about show business itself and many of the numbers take place on the stage. the others seem like the likely result of bringing show people together: of course they are going to sing and dance from time to time. Looking at them these days, the singing is kind of boring, the comics dreadful and the plots the answer to a moron's prayer. It's the dance numbers that are timeless. These films were made for highlight reels like ""That's Entertainment"".Rogers and Hammerstein changed all that. They took serious plays and converted them into operetta of popular music. Characters who were not in show business at all used songs and dances as soliloquies to reveal their private thoughts. The result was some of the best plays and films of all time- Oklahoma, Carousel, The King and I, South Pacific, The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Gigi, My Fair Lady, The Music Man, etc. South Pacific was the first film my parent sever took me to see and this is the type of musical I normally prefer. Here songs tended to dominate- ""Surrey with the Fringe on Top, ""Out of My Dreams"", ""People Will Say We're in Love, ""If I Loved You"", ""My Boy Bill"", ""I Have Dreamed"", ""Hello Young Lovers"", ""Some Enchanted Evening"", ""Younger Than Springtime"", etc. ,etc. There are dance pieces but the dancers are on the sidelines.""Singing in the Rain"" is the greatest of all the Hollywood Musicals. It has the memorable dances a Hollywood Musical needs: ""Make 'Em Laugh"", Singing in the Rain"", ""Good Morning"", ""Broadway Melody"". There is also the best of the Freed-Brown songbook, such as ""You are My Lucky Star"". But it has the strongest story of any of the Hollywood Musicals, thanks to the Comden-Green team and the memories of the early days of sound. it's virtually the only Hollywood Musical that could have held up as a non-musical. It could have just been a comedy about he conversion to sound. it would not have been ""Singing in the Rain"", but it would have been good.As it is, it's the one musical that has it all."
"""Singin' in the Rain"" is considered by many to be the greatest movie musical of all time. It's hard to argue that point. It's got everything, a solid cast, great songs, glorious Technicolor and solid production numbers.Don Lockwood (Kelly and Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) are vaudevillians in the 1920s. They are not doing so well and decide to try Hollywood. Lockwood becomes a stunt man who graduates to starring in adventure films with co-star Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). It is the time of the introduction to sound and it is discovered that Lamont does not have a voice suitable for sound. One night after being mobbed by adoring fans, Lockwood meets Kathy Selden (the still teen-aged Debbie Reynolds), an aspiring singer/dancer. Love at first sight. Kathy is trained to dub Lamont's voice in the studio's first sound film. It is a big success. Lamont arranges for Kathy to be contractually bound to continue dubbing her voice. But Lockwood, Cosmo, and studio boss R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell have other ideas and...................................There are several memorable performances in this film. O'Connor performs the comical ""Make 'em Laugh"", Kelly of course performs the title tune and appears in the ""Broadway Melody"" production number with a cast of thousands and the lovely Cyd Charisse with whom he has a couple of dance numbers. The stars do a delightful ""Good Mornin"" song and dance as well. Jean Hagen almost steals the film as the deceitful Lina Lamont.MGM dusted off several of their old songs for this film. ""Good Mornin'"" for example, was sung by Judy Garland in 1939's ""Babes in Arms"". The song, ""Beautiful Girl"" is ably performed by Jimmy Thompson who received no billing or acclaim for his effort. Wwatch for Rita Moreno as Zelda, Lamont's scheming ally. ""B"" western bad guy Douglas Fowley turns in a dandy performance as the frustrated director and Kathleen Freeman and King Donovan turn up in minor roles as well.This would by Gene Kelly's second of back to back successes following ""An American in Paris"" a year earlier. Sadly the movie musical was on decline and both Kelly and O'Connor would soon be searching for alternatives. The diminutive Debbie Reynolds was just getting started and would go on performing on stage, film and TV for the rest of her life."
"Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of ""An American in Paris"", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, ""The Dueling Cavalier"", is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - ""I love you, I love you, I love you"".All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very pleasant speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number ""Make 'Em Laugh"" along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun."
"Unfortunately, after watching Singin in the Rain over a thousand times, i can find absolutely nothing wrong with it. It has to be said, this is the best film in existence.The songs are all incredible and are some of the few that can get stuck in your head for a week and you still won't be sick of them. Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly singing ""Moses Supposes"" is definitely one of the highlights. As is Kelly singing in the rain, O'Connor making 'em laugh, Reynolds, Kelly and O'Connor wishing each other a good morning... i could go on.The first time i saw Singin in the Rain i was eight years old,and that was nine years ago. Loved it then and i adore it now.Definitely one you need to see."
"Every now and then comes along a movie so iconic, everyone knows its name, even if they haven't seen it. And sometimes the hype greatly overstates the value. Singin' in the Rain has its good moments but it is also a mess of a movie.The main romance in the film came out of nowhere. It has that age old clich√© where two people do not like each other at first but then fall in love, except the clich√© is done badly. The dislike is very sudden, feels very forced to the point that it seemed like the main female character could not act. After the initial dislike there is no natural progression to a warmer relationship. It just becomes a fact at one point so the romance also feels very sudden and forced.The story as a whole has a disorienting structure, getting interrupted by parts that do not belong.The film is saturated with little jokes and slapstick and almost none of that stuff is funny! After a while the dumb forced humour becomes painful. There is a character played by Donald O'Connor whose mission it is to be a harlequin that got high on speed. He has a good delivery and can be funny but he also overdoes the whole clown business to the point of his character becoming annoying.The actors are definitely capable when they want to be, they sing very well and they dance well too. But those 3 aspects (acting, singing and dancing) are not tied together well. Look, if you wanted to make some random songs, make an album and put it on a record. If you are making a film with a story then it has to make sense and the songs in it have to be related. That is not the case here.On top of that, the songs are not all good either. There are two songs, Singin' in the Rain and Good Morning (to a lesser degree), that are discernibly interesting. The rest are average, some with primitive rhymes and of questionable purpose in the movie. There is one song that starts for no apparent reason and is not about anything, with its few lyrics being nonsensical babble. It is several minutes of your life you will never get back. The song could have been cut out of the film and it would have lost NOTHING.Moreover, the music is constantly being interrupted either for a change in tune or for another scene or for a dancing part. I like tap dancing too but quitting and interrupting the music into which your brain is trying to tune feels horrible, like getting mentally slapped. These dancing parts are not brief pauses either; they last a while and they too get interrupted by slapstick or other dancing scenes. What a mess.As the movie was drawing to a close I was bored and tired of it (my partner tuned out after just 10 minutes). And that is despite the fact that certain parts of this film are bouncing of the wall hyperactive. The music is good, the acting is good, but the structure is wrong. Next time someone asks me to watch this movie, they will need to get me high first, because clearly that is what the makers were when they made it."
"I was decided to watch this movie, because I knew and already watched the famous sequence of Gene Kelly singing in the rain .(what makes the movie very famous and also gives the name of it). After watching it, I can say that it is a delightful movie with also a pleasant story: They are in 1927, and Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are famous actors in Hollywood, who always make a couple in their movies,making many rumors emerge about their real relationship. The problem is that the movies now are not mute as a year ago, and they couple of actors have difficulties, since both need to take new acting and speech lessons. Lina, however has a horrible voice, needing to be dubbed by Kathy Selden, a young actress who has a beautiful voice, and makes Don fall in love. It's very funny to see the difficulties of the producers of that time, like when they put the microphone in Lina's chest to record her voice, but they also record Lina's heart beats."
I didn't like the film i thought it was drawn out way to long at the end when you already knew what was going to happen. Im not big on musicals though i thought the artistic aspect of the film was very cool. As well as the ability of the main character to act and dance. I liked how the film used colors as well certain scenes were very vibrant with colors to set the mood while others had a lot of grey in them. I thought the setup for the film was amazing though as well as the editingt. The scenes were immensely large and abstract. Though i don't like musicals i thought a lot of the film was interesting even though i didn't like the music there is a lot of visuals in the film i found to be cool.
"Okay, I know, you're po-mo, you like independent film, you want to see hard-hitting stories with deep characters who are dragged into a seedy underworld of drugs, or interacting with monstrous virtual reality worlds, or exploring human relationships against the stresses of modern politics. Plus, you've seen the title dance number, so you know what it's all about, and you don't need to see a whole bunch more of that stuff. And all that musical crap, it's all a little corny, isn't it? Etc.Friends, I was once like you. But I have come to see the light. The ""rain"" dance sequence, that I had seen a million times before, is entirely transformed when seen within the context of the film. In fact, ALL the dancing is hypnotic and fascinating. The story is funny in an intelligent way, and certainly very involving. The LONG takes of flawless dancing still amaze--especially compared to something like the editing of ""Chicago,"" trying to hide its dancer's flaws. Here there's nothing to hide.In short, I have come to understand that EVERY HUMAN BEING NEEDS TO SEE THIS FILM. That means you. Spend some time with it, and even if you don't like it, you will be a better person for having it in your mind. Now I've done all I can do, the rest is up to you."
"In 1927, the former stunt Don Lockwood (Gene Kelley) becomes a successful actor with the company of his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) forming a romantic pair with the actress Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen).In the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures, Don accidentally meets the aspirant actress Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) while escaping from his fans and fall in love for her. Lina has troubles with the sharp tune of her voice, and Cosmo and Don decides to dub her, using Kathy's voice, to save their movie. When the jealous Lina finds the strategy of the studio, she does not want to share the credits with Kathy and tries to force the studio to use Kathy in the shadow to dub her in other productions. But when Lina decides to speech and sing to the audience, the truth arises.""Singing in the Rain"" is a musical masterpiece, one of those unforgettable movies that the viewer never get tired of watching. The cast is in state of grace, with wonderful interpretations. Jean Hagen is simply fantastic in the role of Lina Lamont, an actress unable to speak correctly and with an awful voice. Debbie Reynolds has a doll face, Donald O'Connor is very funny and Gene Kelly is fantastic. This is certainly one of the best movies ever made. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cantando na Chuva"" (""Singing in the Rain"")"
"Let's get things straight: this is by no means a bad musical. There are some wonderful numbers- ""Make Em' Laugh"", ""Good Morning"", that one where the gal with the long leg dangles a hat in front of Gene Kelly- but the film itself is disappointing. I've always found Gene Kelly too arrogant and annoying to want to watch him as a romantic lead, a bit too uptight to be comic and his dancing's better in An American in Paris. Debbie Reynolds is cute but not earth-shattering. Donald O'Connor is fabulous- he's the reason to watch this film. His talent, particularly for comedy, exceeds Kelly's talents. He's definitely underrated.I was told that the whole spoofing of the advent of the talkies was hilarious. It's mildly amusing at best. The characters didn't really grab me either. It's a total myth that the story of a musical can get away with being complete fluff. Even if the story's a bit of a stretch (or a lot if it's Brigadoon), it should at least be entertaining. This film really ought to have simply been a revue.I think that nostalgia and hype may have clouded the judgement of quite a few viewers."
"The heaps of scholarly criticism heaped on ""Singing' in the Rain"" have done it a disservice by giving it the ball and chain reputation of an IMPORTANT picture in cinema history. Let's not forget why ""Singin' in the Rain"" was made, which was to provide a form of escapist entertainment, nor why it's still so loved now, which is because it's great fun and everything clicks. It's not homework, and it's not medicine.I don't even think it's the best movie musical ever made (I liked MGM's ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" more), and it's not one I feel compelled to go back to again and again. I'm not a huge fan of Gene Kelly, and think he's squirrelly when he's trying to be dashing, and Donald O'Connor's manic energy is just as likely to be exhausting as it is funny. But there's no improving on Jean Hagen's pitch-perfect performance as the ditzy villainess, and Debbie Reynolds shows how sweet and charming she was early in her career, before she became a broad.The songs and dances aren't especially well integrated into the film --you can practically hear the gears grinding whenever the film transitions from its book to its musical portions. But the numbers are so wildly entertaining in and of themselves that you don't much care. The ""Singin' in the Rain"" sequence does what far too few films do -- it transports you to a place where what's happening on the screen in front of you is the only thing that matters.Grade: A-"
"Much as I admire the talents of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, it's really Jean Hagen who provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. Her character also provides the key to the plot for this witty look at Hollywood making the transition to sound films. A pity Hagen wasn't given any of the song numbers to participate in--but that's my only complaint. Everything is in good hands here--Kelly and Reynolds and O'Connor do outstanding jobs. The only other drawback, as I see it, is the extended Broadway musical number Kelly imagines and co-starring Cyd Charisse. It strikes a somewhat jarring note and wasn't really necessary. His song-and-dance routine in the rain is, of course, the most famous highlight--but equally endearing is the 'Good Mornin' number, staged with such style and verve and performed with gusto by the three stars. Betty Comden and Adolph Green provided a supremely funny script, somewhat reminiscent of an older film with Alice Faye and Don Ameche called 'Hollywood Cavalcade'('39), which also dealt with the transition from silent to sound movies. One of the great MGM musicals, not to be missed."
"SINGIN' IN THE RAIN's story is well known, and concerns 1920s silent romantic acting team Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen.) Trouble is that sound is coming in--and Lina's speaking voice could peel paint off the wall. The solution? Don's best friend (Donald O'Connor) and love interest (Debbie Reynolds) have the inspiration of revamping Lockwood and Lamont's debut sound film as a musical, with Reynolds dubbing Hagen's vocals. The resulting story is a high-energy, extremely witty, and truly sparkling film laced with period songs by Arthur Freed, a film that many regard as the single finest musical to emerge from Hollywood.In many respects SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a throwback to the early musicals of the era it satirizes, for many of its musical numbers ('Make 'em Laugh' is a notable example) have absolutely nothing to do with the story it tells--but unlike such early musicals the storyline is exceptionally strong, and since the film is about the creation of an early ""all talking, all dancing, all singing"" movie in which such musical numbers were typical, they have here a certain validity that could not otherwise be achieved.The cast is absolutely flawless, and without exception Kelly, Reynolds, O'Connor, and Hagen (particularly memorable as the literally unspeakable silent star) give the finest performances of their respective careers. The musical numbers range from the vibrant and complex 'Good Morning' to the lyrical 'You Are My Lucky Star' to the brilliantly conceived and executed title song, each without exception the definition of perfection. The art designs are meticulous, beautiful, and recreate the late-silent and early-sound era of Hollywood with considerable wit and charm. As a whole, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN possesses an energy and vitality that simply makes you bounce in your seat from excitement.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a musical that even people who hate musicals love. Whether or not you consider it ""the"" finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, GIGI, and THE WIZARD OF OZ. But no matter where you personally rank it, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is certainly ONE of the best, a film that simply gains in critical and popular stature with every passing year, a national and a world treasure of cinematic art.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"""Singin' In The Rain"" is a musical for people who don't like musicals. Fast, funny, self-aware, and chock full of the best singing and dancing you can cram into 105 minutes, it might as well be the best movie musical since the entire genre peaked here, never to be effectively revived.Fittingly, the movie focuses on the birth of the Hollywood musical. It's 1927, and the silent-film romantic pair of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) find themselves suddenly wired for sound after ""The Jazz Singer"" inaugurates a new era. While there are a lot of problems for the pair to overcome, including the fact he hates her for the nasty witch she is, the only real problem is that Lina's Godzilla-like ego comes with a Godzilla-like voice. Making their new movie into a musical might then seem a bad idea, except that Don's new girl Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) can sing like a dream, and doesn't mind dubbing Lina.Knowing humor abounds in this classic, clever film. ""You have to show a movie at a party. It's a Hollywood law,"" says Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Lockwood's buddy. An opening sequence features a Hedda Hopper announcer introducing vogue-ing celebrities at a red-carpet premiere. ""They've been married two months now, and happy as newlyweds,"" she coos as a catatonic couple stroll past.Even the musical numbers are done with a wink, like ""Beautiful Girl"" and ""All I Do Is Dream Of You."" This would be a great film even if the most famous of those numbers, Kelly's ""Singin' In The Rain,"" was left on the cutting-room floor. There's still ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" the funniest song-and-dance routine ever done (by O'Connor and a mannequin) and ""Good Morning,"" with some of the most intricate tap dancing ever performed times three.But ""Singin' In The Rain"" IS there, and it fully deserves its place in the pantheon, not only with Kelly's wonderfully irrational exuberance but some incredible camera work that pans over and around him to maximize the uplift in this goose-pimple number.If only they left out (and not just trimmed) that Broadway musical number near the end, the pseudo-ballet with Cyd Charisse. It pulls us away from the story for 20 minutes, apparently so Kelly could have a section with his favorite dance partner. No one ever looked better on the big screen, or projected such natural-seeming charisma, as Genial Gene, but apparently he could throw his elbows with the best of them. It's obvious how much this film owes to the other director, the playful and creative Stanley Donan. If Kelly stuck to the on screen stuff, this would have been a better film.But what am I talking about? It's ""Singin' In The Rain""! I can't dock this simply because Kelly had a big ego. He earned it with this great film, a movie milestone. If you never see another movie musical, see this one. You'll be glad you did."
"I watched Singin' in the Rain for the first time ever this afternoon and I think I'm in love. Oh Gene Kelly!.. *What* I would give to have you flash those pearly whites at me! The story is really just a musical about a musical, going into various dream-like sequences embodied in the twelve minute ""Broadway Ballet"". The songs are cleverly intertwined with the acting so there's none of that phoniness one is used to seeing in some musical pictures. To watch the choreography is to watch pure genius. Gene Kelly is so talented it should be outlawed. (It's downright sacrilegious he wasn't nominated for the Academy Award¬Æ!)  I mean - DAMN! I kept backing up to the 'Singin' in the Rain' part seventy-five times in a row...it fills me with such a sense of joy! My Gramps once broke his ankle trying to imitate ol' Gene. The supporting cast is perfect as well, you really must hand it to Debbie Reynolds! She wasn't a trained dancer up until this point. They made her rehearse eight hours a day, hiring different dance instructors to work with the young actress in shifts. The stress proved so overwhelming she eventually had a breakdown and caught the attention of neighboring Fred Astaire who asked, ""Why are you crying?"" Not able to recognize the man through her tears, Reynolds confessed she felt hopeless and would never meet Kelly's standards. Astaire led her to another rehearsal room where he was busy working on Royal Wedding. ""You come watch me,"" he said. ""You watch how hard I work. I don't cry, but I do get frustrated and upset and I'm going to let you watch."" The experience showed her how a legendary performer like Astaire, known for his elegant moves on the dance floor, can even feel daunted : )Finally, what else can I say (other than Cyd Charisse wears the hottest dress I've ever seen)? This is one of THE greatest films of any genre ever! They just don't make 'em like this anymore."
"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, and Jean Hagen are just great in this movie! The best sequences are Gene's 'Singin' in the rain' dance in the rain (pure cinematic genius!), the scene where Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) tries to say her lines with a diction coach (Kathleen Freeman) (her 'can't' comes out 'cain't), the 'Good Morning' dance with Gene, Debbie, and Donald, and the famous 'Broadway Melody' ballet with Kelly and Cyd Charisse (with a Clara Bow/Louise Brooks haircut and a seductive dress). I was in a production of 'Guys and Dolls' and the kids in the troupe worshiped this musical. I would watch this film over and over again without getting tired of it! As many film buffs say, this is 'the greatest musical ever'. 10/10"
"SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) **** Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O' Connor, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell, Cyd Charisse, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno.  One of the most beloved and greatest Hollywood musicals ever showcases the divine gifts of musical comedy in the fetching forms of the always subliminally graceful balletic Kelly, rubber-limbed amiability of O' Connor and wholesomely adorable Reynolds as struggling silent screen era film stars (and wannabes) who are at the cusp of the Talkie era to be that will only strengthen the trio in friendship and ultimately romantic true love.  Hagen is a stitch as the Noo Yawky cartoon-voice afflicted shrew co-star of Kelly in their ascent to stardom.  Moreno has a small role as Hagen's equally troublemaking flapper gal pal and look close for character actress/comic foil Kathleen Freeman as Hagen's diction coach (she'd have her hands equally full in several Jerry Lewis vehicles to come).  Filmed in bravura color bursting from the screen with indelible images of eye candy in bountiful cornucopia with its striking backlot sets, larger-than-life costumes and masterful direction by Kelly and the indomitable Stanley Donen featuring Kelly's indelible iconic moment performing the titular tune in resplendent glee and amor du jour.  Kudos to the estimable songwriting team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden for their lively tunes matching in sync to Kelly's choreography (with Harold Rossen) is movie magic replete. Nominated for 2 Oscars (Hagen's hilarious Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton's musical score), they just don't make them like this anymore!"
"As I sit here in a Film class I am taking I understood that I should have an open mind... But a Musical? What was he thinking, Making us watch a musical? Ok, I sat there biasly waiting for the DVD to play the So Called top ten movies of all time, and to my utter amazement and total surprise the movie did not suck. In fact I don't recall ever blinking during the show, it was Funny, Romantic- but not corny, seemed real life- for the most part, and over all quite inspiring to me and my fellow classmates here at The University Of Kansas, KU, United States of America. I must suggest that all those who have ever seen a movie before must buy this movie and add it to their collection of all-time favorites. I garante that any person between the ages of 9months and 120 years will love this show and share the same enthusiasm that I have."
"This film, one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) musicals ever made, unfortunately shows its age.  Redeemed by several outstanding song and dance routines, the film is a fun and fast way to spend 90 minutes or so. However, at the risk of sounding jaded, much of the film is corny and borderline mawkish.  It has not aged well.  I recently saw ""Singin' in the Rain"" at Oakland's Paramount Theatre, a refurbished '20s movie house that can accommodate huge crowds in its big-screen auditorium.  (Those that can should attend - tickets are generally $5, and while food and drink are not allowed in the movie, they have a full bar and beverage service before the show.  Films selected are usually ""classics"" like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Casablanca"", and they have live organ music and Deco Win before each film.) I was amused by both Donald O'Connor, who is great, and the film's dated sensibilities.  Many people were humming to Gene Kelly's famous solo, however, and that's what counts.  That particular scene must be among the ten greatest or most memorable in film history, and it never disappoints.  I rated the film a ""7"" just for that scene alone."
"For sheer enjoyment, no movie ever made beats Singin' in the Rain.  Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly remind us why vaudeville was as popular as it was in the 20s, Debbie Reynolds lights up the screen, and Jean Hagen gives the performance of her career-of anybody's career for that matter.  If the title dance sequence doesn't get you moving, then there's no hope for you. There are only two down spots, ""Beautiful Girl"" and the never-ending ""Broadway Melody"" dance sequence (but the latter is worth it just to see Cyd Charisse).  The rest of the movie is flawless."
"OK, after commenting on many of the great films that I liked very much, I figure it's about time to comment on one of the films that I truly love... ""Singin' in the Rain"".... I just adore the hell out of this film. There are only a few movies out there that can truly transcend any and all boundries, and make even the most depressed person joyful... Singin' in the Rain is one of them.This film is pure magic. In today's teenage-dominated film industry audiences seem to want more of an adrenaline-pumping, special effect-driven thrill ride instead of a film like this which is true cinema art. It communicates feelings of joy instead of mindless heart-pumping action. Today's films are not art... they are mass-produced moneymakers that attempt to give you nothing more than a rollercoaster-like experience. No substance to them at all...But back to the film, the performances are phenomenal! Gene is always great and is the true entertainer. In the famous 15 minute Broadway finale Gene combines three art forms into one (Song, Dance, & Film) to communicate the story of the aspiring actor who comes to Broadway without using one line of (spoken) diologue. This scene should also be noted as quite possibly the most beautiful use of technicolor ever committed to celluloid.Donald O'Connor... what can I say, the man is incredible! It is so refreshing to see a vaudeville performer in a film outside of the silent era. His gravity-defying performance of ""Make 'em Laugh"" echos the great silent comedians of the 20's (especially the great Buster Keaton)...And Ms. Debbie Reynolds rounds out the trio. She's magnificent... especially considering that it's one of her first roles. She posseses a wide range of emotion throughout the film, going from the popping out of a cake :) ...to the tears at the end. I really think her performance is underrated... she really brought so much of everything into this movie and I could never, ever picture anyone else in her role. It's really a shame that her performance of ""You are My Lucky Star"" was cut from the final print.Of course my favorite moment is when these three legends come together to sing ""Good Morning""... ahhh, pure magic!Anyway, I just thought I'd express my joy towards this film... not one of the greatest musicals of all time, not one of the great classics, but one of the greatest films of all time.... period."
"In the book The Films of Arthur Freed, Freed made one comment about Singin' in the Rain that always stood out in my mind. As the film was about the Hollywood era when films were learning to talk, Freed said that there was no need to do any research as he lived the research. He and any number of people who were still working at MGM a quarter of a century later.The knowledge that folks had who worked on Singin' in the Rain and the talent of Gene Kelly are the two things that make that film some consider the greatest of all musicals.Arthur Freed who wrote a lot of the song lyrics in those twenties and thirties MGM musicals together with his partner, composer Nacio Herb Brown, just reached into his own catalog for the score. The whole score is Brown-Freed except for Moses which was written by Roger Edens and Adolph Green and Betty Comden and Fit As A Fiddler with lyrics by Freed and music by Al Goodheart and Al Hoffman.The only 'original' song written for the show was Make 'Em Laugh by Brown and Freed and was Donald O'Connor's specialty. You have to put that in quotes because even the writers agreed they ripped off Cole Porter's Be A Clown. Which is from an MGM musical that Arthur Freed produced. Lucky they weren't sued.Of course the number that Singin' in the Rain is noted for is the title tune sung and danced in the splashing rain by Gene Kelly. That and the Broadway Melody ballet became two of his signature numbers. I know I don't enjoy myself as much as Mr. Kelly did in that inclement weather.Jean Hagen got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing that 'shimmering star in the cinema firmament' Lina Lamont. Unfortunately she lost to Gloria Grahame for The Bad and The Beautiful. One thing that the silent screen did was mask a whole lot of personalities whose voices did not fit the screen image created. That was done for great comic affect by Hagen, but Kelly in some of his love scenes was using the tragedy of John Gilbert who acted in two much the classical manner as a continental lover. Just think how history might have been different if Gilbert had the background of a song and dance man and could have transitioned to musicals. Of course Debbie Reynolds is just fine in her first real starring part as the young singing hopeful whose career is made by sound. So many in fact were, as many as those that were broken. A favorite of mine in this is Douglas Fowley the harassed director trying to get a talking performance out of the nasal Hagen and dealing with the new technology at the same time.As Freed said, no research was needed. Singin' in the Rain is a product of his life experience in those early days of sound."
"""Singin in the Rain"" is a classic Hollywood Picture being both an omage to (the even more) classic Hollywood and a satire of it!Is one of musical's best, but even though some of the songs have stood the test of time, the overall tone might be a bit slow or unpaced for some."
"This is an amazing movie. It will make you laugh, maybe cry, and want to sing. The songs are really catchy. My favorite song is Make Em' Laugh by Donald O'Connor. The movie's story of making a movie with sound is perfectly done and great in the eyes of a filmmaker."
"Copyright 11 March 1952 (in notice: 1951) by Loew's Inc. A Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer picture. New York opening at the Radio City Music Hall: 27 March 1952. U.S. release: 10 April 1952. U.K. release: May 1952. Australian release: 27 June 1952. 102 minutes.SYNOPSIS: At the advent of talkies a popular silent screen team is hamstrung by the fact that the female partner has a voice like a berserk chipmunk.NOTES: Would you believe that Singin' in the Rain ‚Äî the most popular, the most critically acclaimed musical of all time ‚Äî did not receive any prestigious Hollywood awards. In fact the film had only two nominations, the first for Jean Hagen as Supporting Actress (she was passed over by Academy members in favor of Gloria Grahame in The Bad and the Beautiful), and the second for Scoring of a Musical Picture in which category Lennie Hayton lost out to Alfred Newman's With a Song in My Heart.The film didn't fare any better with contemporary critics. Although it placed in number three position (after The Atomic City and My Six Convicts) on his supplementary Hollywood movies list, it didn't make Bosley Crowther's Top Ten Pictures of 1952 for The New York Times. At least the film came in at the number eight spot both on The National Board of Review's Best American Films of the year and the annual Film Daily poll of the nation's film critics.MGM production number: 1546. Shooting from 18 June 1951 through to 21 November 1951, plus one day, 26 December 1951. Rehearsals started on 12 April 1951. Ernie Flatt worked with Debbie Reynolds on her tap dancing, while Kelly, Donen and Haney started on the staging of the numbers.Kelly explains that the two directors, whilst always working in close collaboration, sometimes worked individually as well as in tandem. Two sound stages were often used simultaneously, with photographer Rosson rushing from one set to the other. Kelly says he concentrated on directing the musical numbers, whilst Donen usually handled the straight story material.Two numbers were deleted before the first preview in order to speed up the story: ""You Are My Lucky Star"" sung by Betty Royce whilst Debbie Reynolds gazes at a billboard of Kelly; and Kelly singing and dancing ""All I Do Is Dream of You"".Negative cost: $2,540,800 (which was over budget by $620,996 mostly because the ""Broadway Ballet"" which had been estimated at only $80,000 was considerably extended when Donald O'Connor was unable to participate in the number due to a prior television commitment and a new story was built around substitute star Cyd Charisse). Initial domestic rentals gross: $7,665,000 which made it number ten on the nation's list of Box office Champions for 1952. Interestingly, it was by no means MGM's top grosser of the year, its takings exceeded by both Quo Vadis (shown at roadshow admission prices) and of course Ivanhoe which sold more tickets than any other movie of that year.COMMENT: Why is Singin' in the Rain the greatest of all screen musicals? A perfect marriage of story and songs, for one thing. The story's fresh, vital, witty, sharp amusing, charming, pointed, satirical with interestingly likable characters pacing from one fascinating crisis to another with agreeable fortitude. The songs flow naturally from and are an integral part of the story-line. Moreover these songs themselves are fresh, vital, witty, sharp, amusing, charming, pointed and satirical.Add to perfect story and perfect song, a perfect cast. Kelly is more debonair here and has lost most of that unattractive brashness and even boorishness of the screen persona he created in his earlier films. O'Connor too has toned himself down, only really letting loose in the musical numbers which make a nice contrast to his more unassuming role in the straight sequences. Miss Reynolds is perky, energetic, self-confident yet identifiable girl-next-door. Jean Hagen of course has the best role of her career and gives the performance for which she'll always be remembered.Add to perfect story and perfect songs and perfect cast, perfect direction. Kelly and Donen move their camera fluidly yet unobtrusively through both complex dance steps and constantly entertaining, twisting plot situations. Supporting technical credits are likewise as highly accomplished as they come.One of the things I most like about Singin' the Rain is that it's so consistently entertaining. There are no dull patches at all. True there are highlights, but the pace is so fast, and one highlight follows so quickly on the heels of another, and there are so many, it seems invidious to single three or four out in preference to seven or eight others.I suppose On the Town should have forewarned us, but the super- stylish, super-energetic, super-witty Singin' in the Rain is anything but the sort of stodgy, second-hand musical we expect from MGM. It's nice to have wit plus MGM's super production values as well.POSTSCRIPT: In the picture's credit titles, Freed's song is quoted as providing the script's inspiration. This of course is malarkey. The credit is nothing but a sop to producer's Freed's ego. When initially preparing the script, Comden and Green used their own imagination and initiative. And of course, as we now all know, Kelly actually hated the brash, egotistic O'Connor and conspired with Donen to fabricate various shooting delays so that O'Connor was unable to participate in the movie's rousing finale due to his previous TV commitment."
"Singin' in the rain is one musical that even the most devout of the musical haters in todays world cannot ignore. And speaking as a reviewer who generally dislikes musicals I feel it has everything a musical should have. The songs ""You are my lucky star"", ""Good morning"" and of course the title track are timeless classics to even the most cynical ear. The film also contains a lot of satirical humour which is aimed mainly at the attitudes of the Hollywood Film community of the 1920's. The film is about Don Lockwood and his onscreen (but certainly not offscreen) love Linda Lamont who are big box office movie stars of the silent era. Also in the background is Cosmo Brown who used to work with Lockwood onstage during their early musical careers before making a name for himself as a silent movie actor. But thanks to the success of a certain film called The Jazz Singer their silent world is about to get loud. The Jazz Singer because of its talking segments has stirred a lot of interest among the general public and the Hollywood moguls decide to start making ""Talkie"" vehicles for their biggest stars. At first the silent movie stars mock the idea of these talkies but they soon find themselves undergoing speech therapy and singing lessons. Don Lockwood successfully passes these tests but it is his co-star Linda Lamont who cannot make the transition to be a proper ""talkie"" actress.The Hollywood bosses decide to hire Kathy Selden who is a chorus girl to overdub Lamont's voice. But soon Lockwood falls for Kathy much to the dismay of Lamont who tries her best to break them up. Singin' in the rain features some of the greatest dance numbers ever filmed particularily during the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" segment which is performed by Donald O'Connor. That dance sequence alone is reason enough to see this film. And of course the title track during which Gene Kelly takes his most famous dance steps is also highly entertaining. And the film does contain plenty of humour especially in the scene where Don Lockwood describes his early musical career to the press as being glamourous and artistically stimulating while we see images of his past that contradict this fact by showing scenes of Cosmo and himself being pelted by angry punters in a small music hall. Though at times the humour is a little bit cruel as a lot of it is at the expense of the character of Lamont. Because of her annoying voice and inability to sing and dance she is constantly ridiculed in this film. The character of Lamont epitomises the actors and actresses who failed to transcend to the world of sound because many of them were from foreign countries who spoke with thick accents. These people were eventually cut loose by the Hollywood industry and many of them lived out their lives in poverty. The fact that this film mocks them by portraying Linda Lamont as an idiot villainess with a horrible irritating voice who deservedly gets pushed aside by the Hollywood Studios at the end of the movie appears to be quite an insult to their memory. These people were not talentless like the character of Linda Lamont they were artists of a different type of medium who suddenly couldn't catch up with the technological advances of Hollywood. This film also places an emphasis on the romantic interest between Lockwood and the chorus girl Kathy. This is very good in parts but there are at times when it doesn't gel together quite right. A snobby movie star of the 1920's would never get too serious with a humble chorus girl. It would have been more believable if Lockwood had been penned as a struggling movie actor himself. The film does have a rather weak ending which would stir up a lot of derision among people who dislike musicals. This is where Lockwood sings ""You are my lucky star"" to Kathy in an attempt to stop her angrily leaving a packed movie theatre. I think they should have just filmed Lockwood singing the song to Kathy alone without anyone else watching. This would have made the ending less cheesier to modern audiences.I would recommend this film to anyone whether they were a musical fan or not. This film along with Calamity Jane, Finian's rainbow and Grease are I feel the greatest musicals of all time."
"I watched this film with the expectation that it would have a good storyline that would keep my interest like Oliver, My Fair Lady, or at least Mary Poppins. I was sorely disappointed. This film has been called ""the best"" film musical of all time. I do not share that opinion.The characters were campy. Gene Kelly was far too happy all the time and it made it very difficult for me to watch him. The dumb blonde played by Jean Hagen was an exception. I found her to be very funny (apparently so did Frank Loesser in that he plagiarized her character in his musical ""How to Succeed at Business Without Really Trying"".) The supporting cast was fair and Debbie Reynolds was competent but I really see no reason to rave about this musical.I would take Fred Astaire over Gene Kelly any day for choreography. The story is rudely and abruptly interrupted by this ridiculous ""vision"" that Kelly has where he is suddenly on Broadway or at a burlesque show and this horrible dance sequence that lasted forever, all in the name of his character finding a good ending to their swashbuckling movie. From swashbuckler to Broadway is a bit of a stretch. Speaking of stretch, visions shouldn't take up half a movie in MY book.This movie was genuinely bad. I am sorry that this is considered a classic. I guess we can look for future generations to hail the Beegee's and Peter Frampton for their ""ingenious"" work when they name ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" a musical ""classic"" as well. After I saw ""Singin' In The Rain"" I could clearly see why the musical genre took a steep dive back then."
"""Singing In The Rain"" is unique in that the song actually inspired the movie. It is set in Hollywood in the mid-1920s. Gene Kelly, 39 when it was made, stars as Don Lockwood, silent film star. Donald O'Connor was 26, played Cosmo Brown, Lockwood's long-time sidekick. And 19-yr-old Debbie Reynolds, in already her 6th film, plays Kathy Seldon, aspiring legitimate (stage) actress set on going to NYC. Lockwood met her initially when he was escaping overzealous fans and leaped into her car from a streetcar top. Also, they later met again when she jumped out of a cake at a party. She obviously needed work!However, the character who really makes the whole story possible, and the movie fantastic, is Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), Lockwood's silent screen co-star, who also happens to be a totally self-absorbed person with the most irritating voice possible. Hagen is absolutely perfect in this role, and I understand she received an Oscar nomination for it.   In 1927, the first ""talkie"", ""The Jazz Singer"" with Al Jolson, changed movies forever. Suddenly the ""talkies"" were making all the money and the Lockwood/Lamont team had to follow or close down. No amount of diction coaching could get Lamont to sound good, and the audience could only laugh at the test screening just 6 weeks before scheduled opening. Cosmo had a great idea - Kathy would dub in her voice over Lina's. Also, the serious ""Dueling Cavaliers"" would become a musical, ""The Dancing Cavaliers.""
The new musical is a big hit, Lina gets coerced by the live audience to sing a song, but it was Kathy singing behind the curtain. Midway through it, they raised the curtain to expose the truth, Lina was put in her place, and the new team of Lockwood and Selden was a hit, on and off the big screen.Except for an extended surreal dance scene with Kelly and Cyd Charisse, which seemed to break the continuity of the story, the movie is almost perfect. I rate it ""9"" of 10. Of course Kelly was choreographer, and co-director, so I suppose he just wanted that number in. The several energetic dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor are simply great, as are the two individual solo numbers, ""Singing in the Rain"" by Kelly, right after Don leaves Kathy's apartment, realizing he is in love with her, and ""Make 'Em Laugh"" by O'Connor, which includes his running up two different inclining walls and back-flipping off them. Who knew Debbie Reynolds could dance so well, and hold her own with Kelly and O'Connor??  Well, she couldn't until she was cast for the part, and she literally worked herself to bleeding feet in rehearsing for the production numbers, and all her hard work shows. She became a dancer for this role.I love music, and I love good dancing. I cannot watch a film like this without mentally comparing the two great dancers of 1950s film, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. I suppose Astaire was the greater ""pure dancer"" of the two, with always perfect positions and movements that would just glide over the floor.  Kelly, however, is my overall favorite of the two. Not only is he a superb dancer, his more athletic build and dancing style, combined with good looks and singing voice, make him more believable in the musical film roles they both starred in."
"This is near-blasphemy, but I would love ""Singin' in the Rain"" even more than I do if it were a non-musical, or, more to the point, a musical with different music. Gene Kelly's talent is incontrovertible, and sequences such as the lengthy ""Broadway Rhythm"" number underscore his (and Stanley Donen's) remarkable vision and talent.They also hold up this snappy, bright, FUNNY comedy.Which is not to say that all of the musical portions are not entertaining adjuncts to the film; the ""Beautiful Girls"" fashion show is hysterically camp, and of course, Kelly's solo ""Singin' in the Rain"" is charming, romantic and joyous. However, the screenplay is so solid on its own, the lesser moments (""Good Morning,"" ""You Were Meant for Me"") seem to drag on forever.Kelly is movie star handsome here, befitting his role as silent screen lover, Don Lockwood. Donald O'Connor is fine as the ubiquitous funny man sidekick, while Debbie Reynolds displays a nice, sassy touch, especially in her first scene. ""Here we are, Sunset and Camden,"" she trills, having just deflated the ego of one of Hollywood's most notorious wolves. She's a much more interesting romantic foil than most of the colorless ingenues which grace male-dominated musicals.But the real scene-stealer is the extraordinary Jean Hagen, as shrill-voiced screen queen Lina LaMont. It is such a bravura performance, she simply blows the competition off the screen. Never once does she break character. Her slow burns and takes as she reacts to other characters' comments and actions are almost as funny as her (numerous) quotable lines. ""I...can...SEEWWWW."" ""People?! I ain't PEOPLE! I'm a...'shining, shimmering star in the Hollywood firmament.' See? Sez so, right there!"" ""I CAN'T make LOVE to a BUSH!"" ""Gee, this wig weighs a ton! What kinda dope would wear a thing like this?"" And, her ultimate manifesto: ""We're so thrilled you enjoyed 'The Dancing Cavalier,' our first musi-cale picture, togither. If we bring a little joy inta ya humdrum lives, it makes us feel all our hard work ain't been in vain for nothin'.""There are countless comic gems in this film: gossip monger Dora Bailey's breathless account of a movie premiere; Lina's hopeless voice lessons; Lina attempting to ""sing""; Don and Lina fighting as they act out a tender, silent movie love scene; and, most famously, the disastrous sneak preview of Don and Lina's first talking picture.This is one musical that can stand on its own merits as a fine example of Hollywood comedy at its best."
"There's just something about musicals that I simply cannot buy into. Something very cheesy about them, but Singing in the Rain is at least watchable. This movie has a cool concept. it's about the transition from silent movies to sound and the problems that arise. Actors/Actresses with unpleasant voices for instance, like Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen, will not be wanted in sound movies. That is the basic story here in this film. Lina Lamont has a horrible high pitched voice that needs to be dubbed out. Kathy Selden, played by the beautiful Debbie Reynolds, is chosen to do the voice over for Lina. Of course things don't go as planned and it culminates in an entertaining ending."
"A lot of people seem to gush over this picture -- ""It's my favorite musical,"" said one critic, and Kelly replied, ""That's good to know."" Well, it's hard to believe in lists of best or worst things because everything is made up of several dimensions. Some are good and some are bad. Sometimes very bad. Nobody would argue that Hitler was a nice guy but he DID love his dog, Blondi.However, I have to agree that within the limits of the genre this is probably the most satisfying musical I've ever seen. There is not a single musical number that is a dud. Kelly and Donen avoid Kelly's usual repetitive steps and he really stretches out on this one. There is about a one minute sequence in the ""Broadway Rhythm"" finale just after Kelly sings ""Gotta Dance"" from his knees that is given over to his solo. His dance is full of balletic leaps and jagged edges. It's a moment on unequaled exhilaration. He seems at time suspended by wires.I'll skip over the contributions of Cyd Charrise -- my God, those LEGS, like a more than usually sinewy giraffe -- and Donald O'Connor. You cannot NOT laugh at O'Connor's number, ""Make 'Em Laugh."" Even after several viewings.The most charming (and best-known) number is Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain,"" but it's not the most technically accomplished. I'd give that honor to ""Moses Supposes."" The whole movie is of course as corny as they come, although it probably didn't seem so in 1952 when it was released. There's nothing pretentious about it. Kelly had an unfortunate tendency to step out of his class with films like ""Invitation to the Dance,"" and to be involved in musicals with dramatic underpinnings like the overblown ""American in Paris."" The thing about this MGM musical -- and a few others like ""On The Town"" and ""The Bandwagon"" is that they were funny as hell IN BETWEEN the musical numbers. Nobody could ever criticize Astaire's dancing. He was great, a much better dancer than Kelly in many ways, but his 1930s musicals with Ginger Rogers were appealing mainly because of their musical numbers. Betty Comden and Adolph Green in the 1940s added stories that could stand on their own as a comedies.There's something about singing as opposed to dancing too. Anybody can sing -- however lousily. You can sing. I can sing. My pet canary sings. Not well, but we all can do it. But dancing is a skill of a different order and to do it well we need the attention of Terpsichore. All those steps that seem so effortlessly improvised on screen (the taps are always dubbed in later) must be memorized one by one by the performers. Tap? Okay -- heel or toe? Thirty seconds of unedited dancing on screen represents about 100 hours of memorization and practice. Not to mention that you have to be in as good a physical shape as a running back.""Singin' in the Rain"" is a perfect example of how a nearly perfect musical should be made. Okay, Debbie Reynolds isn't much of a dancer and she can't sing well, but so what? The overall impact of the movie is so warm and fuzzy that it doesn't matter. It's like nibbling some kind of tiny and exquisite pastry, not a big deal, but the equal of any experience."
"Singin' in the Rain (1952)You gotta love a movie like this. But--how in the world do you talk about a classic that has grown so big it defines its own genre? How can you mention, politely, that it's filled with flaws?If there are parts that are frankly corny, to the point of being ""stupid"" if they appeared in some other movie, can you say so? (The first big opening night scenes where people are getting out of their cars might be one.)If some of the dance scenes seem like throw-ins, adding nothing to the plot and offering only more lighthearted tap dancing and goofing around, isn't this a distraction? (The diction coach dance is one candidate.)What if it's just full of itself? (The Cyd Charisse ballet scenes can be seen that way, for sure.) Or what if the plot is just too obviously a vehicle, and we can't get involved like we should in something more sincere, or more surprising? (The guy lands in the seat of a moving car and finds himself next to the girl, hello?)Well, the answer to all these is you need to chill and lighten up and realize that that's how these musicals go. It's like you had Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds over to your house and everyone started hamming it up and dancing and being silly. And Donald O'Connor stopped by to play piano (and dance up the walls). And you blow it up and give it dazzling color and bright lights. Then rehearse a little so the dance steps aren't just fun, but they are astonishing, and choreographed exquisitely? And what if you, say, want to have a little history of dance thrown in, why not? And of course modern ballet is the counterpart to modern Hollywood musical dance numbers, so why not try to mix them a bit (this is Gene Kelly's doing, mostly)? So if you ramp up the affair into a big budget, slickly filmed movie, but never lose sight of its origins as a kind of fun, not-so-serious romp, it's just a great time. A corny, silly, improbable, romantic, self-effacing, celebratory great time."
"'Singin' in the Rain' has been mentioned as an all-time favourite musical by many and I can totally see why. It is such a delightfully hilarious film, one that can be easily enjoyed with family or a group of friends. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem. The leading lady has a ghastly voice and she can't act. Enter Kathy Selden who offers to be a partial replacement.Donen and Kelly do a stupendous job as directors. It's remarkable how they have brought such a well-crafted piece on screen. For Kelly this is a multiple achievement on different levels as he directs, acts, sings and dance. Clearly the guy is a multi-talented legend. Cosmo Brown too is great as the laugh-out-loud supportive friend. His physical comedy are among the funniest sequences of the film. Debbie Reynolds is pretty ands vivacious. She is lovely, both as singer and actress. Jean Hagen deserves mention as the squeaky voiced and arrogant Lina Lamont.The songs are full of energy and spectacularly shot. The dances are amazingly choreographed and a treat to watch. The visuals are pleasantly colourful. The cinematography is superb, especially the long takes. There has already been so much said about the film that I doubt I could add anything new but this is one of the few classic that feels fresh, lively and energizing even today and perhaps it will remain a significant hallmark in the history of cinema."
"Up there with film classics such as 'Casablanca' and Orson Wells' groundbreaking 'Citizen Kane', 'Singin' in the Rain' is one of the all-time top films to come out of Hollywood. Considered by many (including the American Film Institute) to be the greatest film musical, 'Singin' in the Rain' , with its awesome production values, was made 12 years before the stunning 'West Side Story'.When I first saw the film as a teenager, however, failing to see beyond its American sugar-floss sentimentality, I arrogantly despised it. Yet just one year later I sat through it again and instantly came under its spell, caught up in a magic that has never left me. 'Singin' in the Rain' is a riot of self-indulgent fun, studio skulduggery, romance and innocence of not just one, but two by-gone ages: and therein lieth part of its enduring magic. In rich Technicolor, with some of the finest and slickest visual stunts, (it all looks so effortless on screen) along with some of the greatest song and dance numbers, no one can really say they 'know Hollywood' until they've laughed and cried their way through this film. Parodying a Hollywood back in the days when sound was first coming to the silver screen, it simultaneously reflects the late 1920s, in which the film is set, and the early '50s, (the era in which it was produced). Thus, unwittingly encapsulating much of the entire golden age of Hollywood in one motion picture, like fine wine, it has simply matured with age. The production values are so flawlessly high that I sometimes have to pinch myself to remember that the film recreates in song and dance an era some 25 years earlier..All the songs, including the famous title number, are revivals of numbers that appeared in early sound films, giving the film an air of authenticity. Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh' number is a particular highpoint to watch out for. The typically flamboyant Gene Kelly ballet sequence in the second half is slightly more controversial, with some viewers feeling that despite its brilliant choreography and staging, it slows the action and is out of touch with the naive innocence of the rest of the film, but others view it is the sequence that makes the movie, giving it balance.It is worth noting that this ballet sequence probably would never have made it into the film at all has it not been for the stunning 1948 British film, 'The Red Shoes' (produced by Powell and Pressburger). The ballet sequence featuring Moira Shearer included 15 minutes of uninterrupted, dialogue-free screen time. Gene Kelly loved it, and thanks to the critical and popular success of 'The Red Shoes', (photographed by the legendary Jack Cardiff), Kelly convinced producer Arthur Freed that ballet on film was commercially viable.Just five months before the 1952 premier of 'Singin' in the Rain', MGM had released another major Gene Kelly musical, 'An American in Paris', and initially, this was the film critics preferred. However, with audiences making 'Singin' in the Rain' a box-office hit from the very start, critical opinion began to change and it soon became clear that 'Singin' in the Rain' possessed a timeless quality approaching sheer perfection, revealing that the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts. Overall, in a happy combination of chance and design, (not forgetting the chemistry a 19 year-old Debbie Reynolds brought to the screen and Adolph Green and Betty Comden's wonderful script), the production elements in 'Singin' in the Rain' flow together perfectly, revealing just how well the Hollywood studio system really could work at those special moments when everyone, craftsmen and artists alike, were on peak form.Due to loving restoration and the marvels of modern digital transfers, we can now see the film as it originally looked, in all its brilliant colour saturation - a far cry from the washed out versions you may have seen as Christmas time TV fodder. If this is the fist time you've ever seen it, then I hope you are wiser than I was, and that you fall in love with this timeless picture first time around: it really is a cinema treat for all ages! C 2007 John Ruffle"
"*SPOILERS In The Rain* Two actors, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), find themselves in trouble when somebody invents 'talking pictures'; Lina more than Don, because she has very bad grammar, a bad character and a terrible voice.She is also 'in love' with Don, who doesn't love her, because of what is written on the gossip magazines, making Don's life more hell than it already is.But thanks to the help of his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and of Kathy Williams (Debbie Reynolds), his true love, Don manages to stay on top, while the vain Lina gets what she deserves.If you want to watch the perfect musical for everybody, ages 2 to 100 (RHPS is perfect, too, but not exactly kiddie material), 'Singin' In The Rain' is the perfect choice, with great acting, ingenious scriptwriting, a nice choice of song (I'm partial to 'Fit As A Fiddle', 'Good Morning' and 'Moses Supposes' myself) which came from MGM's archives, and very good choreographing and directing.A deserved success! Singin' In The Rain: 9/10."
"I will make my comments short and pithy, since not many words can describe the sheer grandeur and thrill of watching this film.So many movies nowadays are two-bit shows that required no thought but lots of CGI. The stories are weak and bland at best, and when they do contain something original, it is usually dull, depressing, and morally sh*tty. The acting is insincere, and the characters are ridiculously one-faced and emotionally distraught in some way. The special effects are the only things keeping the movie in theaters.""Singin' in the Rain"" is the complete, polar opposite of that. When you watch this film, you are transported back to the time frame in which it takes place. You feel the color, excitement, and sounds of Hollywood. But the best thing about it is its boundless joy. This is simply the most fun you will ever have at the movies. You can just feel the vibe and happiness of Gene Kelly's character when he dances through the rainy streets of Hollywood singing that immortal song. The humor is pricelessly good. The musical numbers are simply dazzling, the dance numbers are just sizzling. This is a magical experience. A great substitute for Prozac."
"and came up with:1. Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown are supposed to be about the same age, judging by their childhood flashbacks, but as adults Don looks significantly older (Gene Kelly being thirteen years the senior of Donald O'Connor).2. When Don leaps from a streetcar into Kathy Selden's convertible, she doesn't recognize him, which is odd considering that she later confesses to having seen a ton of his pictures (implying she's a big closet fan). Maybe they'd planned for the makeup crew to muss him up and then forgot about it.3. I wish that the weakest song in the film (""Make 'Em Laugh"", Arthur Freed's quick knock-off of Cole Porter's ""Be A Clown"") didn't accompany what is probably the best dance routine in the film.4. The woman doing Kathy Selden's singing for ""Would You?"" (Betty Noyes) doesn't sound anything like Debbie Reynolds.5. Events in the picture are a little condensed in relation to the real-life birth of the sound era. It's unlikely that a 1927 film like ""The Dueling Cavalier"" would have been hastily remade into a talkie.
(I thought about including points like ""a few of Don Lockwood's spiffy outfits are really ugly"" and ""that head-of-the-studio guy is sometimes annoying"" but then decided that these things, which were no doubt intentional, added to the charm.)And I couldn't think of anything else. The fact that such minor nitpicking was all I could come up with in the movie's disfavor should give an idea of how good it is--as almost all the other reviews here confirm. (Yes, I know some folks think the ""Broadway Rhythm"" sequence is as long and unwieldy as Cyd Charisse's scarf and that ""You Were Meant For Me"" is a little poky, but I wouldn't change either of them. I doubt most people would, when you get right down to it.)"
"I know this film is considered a classic among classics, but as a knowledgeable fan of 1920's music, I always thought this film was the most typically bad example of rewriting late 1920's/early 1930's history. Yes, the settings and costumes are more proper to the period than other films, but the arrangements of the music is strictly 1952.Also, I must put in a plug; I have always thought that Gene Kelly was the most overrated Dancer/Actor of that era.So, while I'm sure that my comments won't change anyone else's love for this movie, I, for one, have always thought it was another typical 1950's musical attempt at history with no grains of truth."
"Wow did I hate this movie. I feel like I need to rewatch it, because this IS supposed to be a good movie right? Like, classic, everyone loves it? I don't for the life of me understand why. I know all the songs, everyone knows all the songs. I recognized the singing in the rain scene. Who doesn't? But goddamn! This movie was a star vehicle if there ever was one! This movie exists just to show how awesome Gene Kelly was, and doesn't get anything else right. I've seen musicals before (who hasn't?), and I know for a fact that they're capable of having good plots and likable characters like any other movie! Then why does this one seem so flat?"
"Wonderful wonderful movie! I love this movie as seeing it is a musical. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you scarce any time to be bored. The lighting of the screen as well as the voices of the actors give it a ""vaudville"" taste. It tells of the silent movie era and the transition to ""talkies"" (as mentioned) along with the Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood duo. Wonderful choreography, as seeing the two dancers match up just perfectly in step. I imagine it must have taken a long time to learn, practice, develop and film the steps perfectly. It is chock-full of wonderful music, dancing and singing. What's more, the songs sang by the actors reoccur frequently during the movie, which reminds you of the scene it was last sang in. Which is a refresher, and the closing is a wonderful aspect of humanity. I love it!!"
"I'm not a fan of musicals, but I loved this - great story and characters, smooth integration of music into the storyline, and great music at that."
"This is the most disappointing film I have ever seen.It is certainly not the worst film, but I had such high expectations because of the cast and how famous the movie is.However, as a movie, it is contrived, banal, uninteresting, uninspiring and unbelievable. In fact, none of the movie made sense at all until I watched the special features that contained interviews with some of those originally associated with the movie.Then it all became clear: One interviewee pointed out that the film was created purely as a vehicle to string some promising songs together, as well as to try and recycle a couple of duds that had bombed in the hope they would be better received on this outing.And that is exactly what the movie looks like - a disjointed collection of 'music videos' strung together into a contrived story.Lots of other movies or stage shows have taken the same tack, such as the Abba musical Mama Mia. And while they may be harmless fun, they would not qualify as 'great' musicals in the way that the truly great musicals can - where music and story are brilliantly woven together into a beautiful fabric that is better than either the story or the music could be on its own.It has some merit as an example of an early advertising vehicle, where the threat posed by product pitches in distorting and destroying art was not yet fully understood. But any reasonably critical view of this film at that time should have stopped this poor film and that tragic trend in their tracks.As it turned out, audiences were prepared to accept and even celebrate the mediocre in order to fawn over favorite celebrities. And that wide embrace of shameless-advertising-as-art and celebrity over quality would prove over subsequent decades to be the dominant trend."
"Well, I have to be one of those people who simply HATED this musical and really cannot see all the fuss over it, or ever why people think it should have won the Oscar for best picture of that year. Although it had some catchy tunes, and I guess the dancing was fine, it really didn't grab me. The plot was nearly non-existent. I put it up there with ""Easter Parade"", ""Bandwagon"", and ""Finian's Rainbow"" as the most boring musicals. Even though all of them have some wonderful tunes, none of them really do anything. Though I fully understood the weak excuse of a plot dealing with the transition from Vaudville, silent movies, then to talkies, I found that the actual plot was so thin it left me wanting, and it became nothing more than an excuse on which to hang some songs (albeit some really catchy and lively ones).Sadly, I find that to be the trouble with most Movie musicals. There are no characters that develop at all. However, there are some that have really grabbed me: ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", ""Meet me in Saint Louis"" (and yes, it hasn't got a strong plot either, but it hangs together far better than ""Singing in the Rain"")""Brigadoon"", ""Showboat"",""Wizard of Oz"", and a few like that. My favourite musical is ""Fiddler on the Roof."" Why it appeals to me is there is a real plot, and the music is not intrusive and doesn't stop the actual storyline. That is my biggest complaint with musicals is the way everything comes to a stop for the music (""Oliver"" is one of the worst for this), and that usually the plot is so weak that well, were it not for the music there would be nothing whatever to watch.Each performer did a masterful job in this movie, that I can admit. The choreography was well thought out (especially anything that Gene Kelly danced, but of course, he did the choreography, so naturally what he designed for himself would be masterful). Even the singing was quite good (though I prefer more robust singing over Kelly's soft breathy crooning). And of course, the sets, costumes, and all that were wonderful. And the editing was well done.But even with all that going for it, it just left me cold and for the most part, bored. The only Movie Musical that bored me more was ""Westside Story."" And again, it is a musical with some really great music, just far too long."
"Singin' in the Rain is one of the most-loved and celebrated film musicals of all time from MGM.The lively and energetic film, co-directed by Stanley Donen and dancer,star,and choreographer Gene Kelly. Singin in the rain isn't just a basic musical it was outstanding, with not just great song and dance number's but good acting too. It was also very breathtaking and graceful, along with anticipation. There was a comical side to from the great Donald O'Connor(Cosmo Brown) and wonderful dances including Cyd Charisse. You don't need much dialogue when you have such high quality and expressive Song and dance's. Gene, Debbie,Donald and Cyd gave outstanding performances and created something which will never be created again. Everything about 'Singin in the rain' is perfect and magical.It's most definitely a film that you can watch over and over, that proves how good it really is."
"Singin' In The Rain quite possibly one of the best movie musicals of all time. The dancing is unforgettable and fantastic, mesmerizing the audience until the credits are done.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are perfect in their roles.  Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a cocky and handsome superstar in the 1920s who just made a bad talking movie with his romantic leading lady, Lena Lamont (Jean Hagen).  Donald O'Connor's character, Cosmo Brown, is the absolutely hilarious best friend of Lockwood, who sings his famous ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number and cracks jokes from beginning to end.  Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) enters the plot as Lockwood's love interest and Lena Lamont gets jealous.  ""Moses Supposes"", ""Singin' In The Rain"" and ""Broadway Melody"" are fantastic and classic numbers that will make you want to become a dancer yourself! Each time I watch this film, it gets better and better.  I can never get sick of it. ***1/2 out of ****"
"""Singin' in the Rain"" is rightly regarded as one of the most fondly regarded musicals of Hollywood's golden age.  Not only does it contain four superb performances (Gene Kelly as vain silent screen idol Don Lockwood, painfully making the transition to sound; Debbie Reynolds as Cathy Selden, a chorus girl who wants to be a great actress; Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown, the dependable friend who puts fun into the movie; and Jean Hagen as the screechy Lina Lamont, Don's erstwhile co-star) but is an affectionate tribute to the birth of the talkies.The best scene of all is of course, Gene's dance down a rain-sodden street, much anthologised and by far the most technically accomplished and totally joyous piece of musical cinema.  I also have to mention the Broadway Melody sequence, featuring the great Cyd Charisse - perfection itself."
"That ""Singin' in the Rain"" is a great film you can learn from more erudite and closely argued reviews than mine (and from more enthusiastic reviews, too, although I love the film as much as anyone and could be just as enthusiastic if I chose).I'd just like to mention one thing: the films within the film. Donen and Kelly deserve especial credit for not slacking off here. The swashbuckling silent picture that introduces us to Lockwood and Lamont actually comes across as a well-made crowd-pleaser (it is admittedly more compressed than a real film of the era would have been, but we can forgive the compression), and since Gene Kelly isn't afraid to give Lockwood his own charm, energy and physical skill, it's no strain at all to believe that he's a popular actor, or that the film could be a box-office success. (I wouldn't mind seeing it myself.) And the first and last sound Lockwood-and-Lamont vehicle is equally persuasive (in its earlier incarnation as a dire piece of petrified staginess AND later, when it's a perfectly decent early stab at a screen musical).Kelly claims that the ""Broadway Melody"" section grew and grew from a tiny diversion to a huge, long, lavish diversion; and this, too, tells us something: that side references of this kind, to projects which the various characters happen to be or have been working on, have a life of their own, which means that the projects themselves have a life of their own. This is a GOOD thing. The musical numbers that are part of the story fit the story perfectly well, and as everyone knows the title song could not be a more natural or apt expression of Lockwood's feelings than it is in context. The musical numbers that are NOT part of the story are bound by no such rules of integration. Nor should they be.The final film-within-the-film ¬ñ Lockwood and Selden's first project together, the film they're looking at a billboard advertisement for in the final shot ¬ñ is also entitled ""Singin' in the Rain"". Some people think that the film they make is more or less the film we see. But of course it isn't. ""Singin' in the Rain"" ¬ñ neither the film we see, nor any film that Lockwood and Selden would have made together ¬ñ is not some exercise in twee, unimaginative, academic self-reference. These people have talent. It's clear from the other samples of their craft that they're capable of CREATING stuff (in fact, they could scarcely prevent themselves from doing so), and they don't need to bottle their own autobiographies and pass it off as art. If you want some clue as to what the film-within-a-film version of ""Singin' in the Rain"" is like, look to the opening credits, in which we see Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds singing in the rain together. I believe that this is a conceptual sketch (just as the version of ""Broadway Melody"" we see is a conceptual sketch) of the musical number as it will appear in Lockwood and Selden's film. It's clear the film they make is something entirely removed from the story of how they came to make it."
"This is a good movie.  Good acting, nice story, all that.  But several of the song and dance numbers seem like they were in the movie just because they thought there should be a song and dance number at that point.  The numbers didn't advance the story, or illustrate people's emotions, or anything like that.  Some examples are the dance number with the dialogue coach, ""Good Morning"", and the entire ""Broadway Melody"" sequence.  That last one is an amazing number, but it doesn't fit in this movie.  There's no reason for it."
"Gene Kelly's outstanding performance and second-to-none direction make this easily one of the best films ever produced and arguably the best musical this side of Oz. Kelly and Jean Hagen (Oscar-nominated) are two of the biggest movie stars of the late-1920s. However, films are turning to sound and Hagen has an awful voice. Enter a very young Debbie Reynolds as the voice behind Hagen's physical performances. The film is intelligent, funny, dramatic, and the musical numbers only add to everything else within the landscape of the movie. Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, and Rita Moreno are all perfect in supporting turns. 5 stars out of 5."
"Let me start off by saying, I hate musicals.  Hate them.  I have little respect for a genre with such patently bizarre conventions as the musical. Of course, there will always be a place in my heart for The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, as they are films that are more rites of passage than actual entertainment, they are part of the American cultural landscape in a way that makes them almost unavoidable.  I also, much to my chagrin, like Grease and Hair, but for different reasons.With all that said, I love Singin' in the Rain.  I love it.  It is one of the finest films that I have ever watched and I can watch it again and again.  SitR is a fun movie, that pokes fun at its own conventions and explodes them in strange and wonderful ways.  Gene Kelly is simply too cool.  He is one of the few men that project cool while doing goofy and graceful dance steps (Billy Joel could pull it off sometimes too).  Gene Kelly is a damn cool guy with the chops and credentials to make nearly any role legitimate.  SitR is no exception. Especially the bizarre, Bernhard-esque dance number at the end, which Kelly choreographed himself.  Fantastic.Donald O'Connor, though, is one of the main reasons why this film works.  He is damn funny.  His hyperkinetic Make'm Laugh skit still gets me rolling today.  He is beyond brilliant in this film and really makes his scenes work.The plot itself is interesting, it is a musical about the origins of musicals.  It is a romance, a comedy, a history lesson and a some of the best dance numbers ever all rolled into one.  I don't really know what else to say about this film except... wow."
"The biggest numbers, the greatest stars, the snappiest dialog, and a story worth telling... Sure the lengthy ""Broadway Melody"" ballet at the end drags things for the non-dance fan, but even it is a superior effort to other attempts at a jazz ballet, say, American in Paris.  From ""Fit as a Fiddle"" to ""Lucky Star"" the numbers sizzle.  If you single out the title tune and Kelly's wonderful dance, you can't forget the outrageous O'Connor's ""Be a Clown"" or either of the male leads comedy duets.  Words fail me.  See the movie."
"I love this movie!!!  While the music definitely has a 1950s sound to it, it also somehow fits the 1920s, which is what it is portraying.  My favorite song from Singin' in the Rain is ""Good Morning.""  I love ""Good Morning,"" because it doesn't really make much sense, yet it fits perfectly in the time it is sung (1:30 am).  No one really makes much sense at 1:30 in the morning if they have been up all day.The casting and direction were done superbly.  Gene Kelly is not only good looking, but he also can dance, sing, and act like it is going out of style. He is wonderful in every movie I have seen him in, & I must admit that he is one of my favorite actors of all time!"
