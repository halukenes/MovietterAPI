"La La Land is a cinematic marvel. It's nostalgia, meticulousness and joy captured my heart and earned itself the title of one of the best musicals of all time.Almost every aspect of La La Land is close to perfect making this not only one of the best movies in recent history but also one of the best looking films and a very memorable cinematic experience. The cinematography is lively with phenomenal long takes, different location and gorgeous colours thanks to the production design. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone make a wonderful musical duo with serious chemistry as if the roles were made for them. The music feels alive at any moment and the sound track is definitely consistent. After Whiplash, the stakes were high for Damien Chazelle and La La Land undoubtedly lands him a spot on Hollywood's best directors. Pulling of two films of the same genre and making both of them seem unique and originally is no easy thing to do and writing a film can be agonising so Damien Chazelle deserves all the praise he's getting.La La Land is a genre defying masterpiece which I would recommend to anyone a fan of musicals or not. It's colourful joyfulness is a sight to see.Final Score: 9+/10"
"Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is a nostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' is anything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three films under his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Umbrellas of Cherborg' and even 'Rebel Without a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least, after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helped them become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music is bouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sum up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los Angeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I have had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I would typically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic."
"The vibrant colors and use of musical scores to set the mood for scenes transported myself back in time. This movie feels not only like a beautifully nostalgic nod to Hollywood of yesteryear, but also that of a timeless love story. Gosling and Stone have a charm to their chemistry on screen during the musical and dance numbers. All these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life, with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers. I was entranced from the opening scene until the final note played by Goslings piano. I absolutely recommend this film to any and everyone!"
"The main characters in this Los Angeles romantic musical are Mia (Emma Stone), a coffee-shop employee with dreams of being an actress; and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist who aspires to open his own club that plays jazz like it was played in the good old days.At long last: a movie released during the 2016 awards season that actually lives up to the hype!Early in the film, there are two superb group musical numbers. The numbers that follow are more low-key relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executed.The stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable. They include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre (jazz) while too often being told it is ""a dying art"".Gosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but it's not long before he fits into the part quite nicely. Stone is superb throughout the film. She is even spot-on as an actress giving mediocre auditions. She's given a full range - and not just as a triple threat - and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song ""Audition"" near the end.There is something uniquely enjoyable about Hollywood portraying itself. The movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"", and ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" all the while being unique and standing out on its own. In addition, the set designs and photography add further to the film's greatness.The reference to ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" comes through strongly in the movie's final number. This scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016. It leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side. The production number is magnificent while its mood is melancholy.The teaming of director/writer Damien Chazelle with musical composer Justin Hurwitz is one of the best matches since Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand in the 1960s.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Directing by Damien Chazelle2) Acting by Emma Stone3) Music by Justin Hurwitz"
"Writer/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career going for him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing, and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does not do the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAME remake grew up, had children of their own, and then those children hijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dance sequence.From that point on, the film is hypnotic.We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expected to see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfect and totally wonderful.Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance, but he delivers the goods. Stone, who was supposed to be ""the next big thing"" after Easy A (2010), steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. The awards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The film industry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day they would film several different endings per picture -- and then decide at the last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending, along with the ""real"" ending, along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in Hollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.Destined to be a classic. Recommended."
"The last time, I felt like this, in a cinema, I was six years old and I was watching Star Wars. I never imagined, I would ever find that feeling again in a cinema. That sense of being transported to another world. The opening sequence took my breath away and I never got it back. Not even at the end - which left my head spinning. It is a beautiful film with soul, wit, charm, style and love. It is simply outrageous! Bold and fantastic and fantastical. I am a straight man but my love for Ryan Gosling could change all that. He's a melancholy genius and Emma Stone is our muse. This film defies genre. It is a masterpiece. I urge you to see it. I was lucky enough to see it at the BFI London Film Festvial. It has been five days since I saw La La Land and I am still thinking about it and singing the haunting refrain that plays with your soul. I mean it gets in there - that music - the music of the firmament. Flying still, dreaming still... thank you Damien."
"Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. Damian Chazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions. I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startling talent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this young artist will."
"I was interested in seeing this film because not only am I a sucker for a good musical, but I'll admit to being a big fan of Ryan Gosling and I was intrigued to see what the director of Whiplash would do with a musical picture to make it fresh and unique. So when I had the chance to see a late-planned viewing at the London Film Festival, I jumped at the chance (FYI, Ryan Gosling came to the screening as a surprise post- film Q&A attendee despite not appearing at the Headline Gala the night before so I was chuffed!)The premise of the story is that Stone is a young actress who has moved to LA to wait tables while auditioning to try and 'make it', while Gosling is a jazz purist (""Anyone who doesn't like jazz just doesn't have the right...context"", he insists) who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own Jazz bar. Or to put it succinctly - ""Two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams"". The musical flows thematically from first love to heartbreak and every other emotion between, with great music throughout.The most impressive thing about the film, for me, is just how daringly it dances between the old-fashioned ""Singing' In The Rain"" style of musical, and a bolder, modern style. The song numbers are great (the opening number received a round of applause in my viewing) and are an undoubted homage to classic musicals - a thoughtful mixture of old school dance numbers you'd expect from a musical in the 50s, and emotionally-wrenching ballads that hit you where it hurts; there is one particular sequence toward the end of the film which is a real gut-punch. Stylistically the film skirts this same line; the film again looks and acts like a classic musical but frequently we see low-key reminders that this is modern day; actresses using their iPhones, a video being seen on Youtube, etc to remind us that this is set in the present day. If we didn't have these reminders, the visuals would almost have you thinking that this is the 1950s. The cinematography is beautiful and overall the film is visually stunning. There is also no doubt that it is wonderfully directed, with the same masterful control of pace and tension that we come to expect from Damien Chazelle thanks to Whiplash.Gosling in particular is absolutely terrific, with a typically sardonic wit throughout. At the start of the film when his sister says she's worried about him as life seems to have him on the ropes, he responds ""I wanna be on the ropes. I'm just letting life think it has me and then before you know it - BAM. It's a classic rope-a-dope"". His delivery of these sorts of lines can't be matched, and it's easy to see why the producers said in the post-film Q&A that he was the person they wanted for the role in their wildest dreams. It's a role made for him with tons more of the above kind of lines. But more than that, Gosling captures a real emotional intensity at the film's emotional breaking points, more specifically in the sequence towards the end of the film that I mentioned earlier. He manages to convey such convincing emotion without so much as a word.I'd feel bad if I didn't also praise Emma Stone, who has probably never been better. She has wonderful emotional range, from the ecstatic highs of love to the tearful, painful lows. In terms of the Gosling/Stone films, this is by far the best. Their undoubted chemistry is given the full spotlight in this film with freedom to explore said chemistry without restriction. The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while. I'm annoyed I'll have to wait so long to see it again, frankly.Will surely win multiple Oscars and other awards."
"When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone who's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see, but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this film enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want the buzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it again when it's in wide release. The artist in me is inspired again."
"A little film. Not sure whether you might have heard of it yet? Damien Chazelle has followed up his astonishingly proficient ""Whiplash"" – my top film of 2015 – with a sure-fire theatre-filler in ""La La Land"". The old- fashioned musical extravaganza is back, and back with style!""La La Land"" tells the bittersweet love story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) who first meet in an LA traffic jam but then get thrown together by chance (LA is such a small place after all!). Over the course of the next four seasons romance blossoms. Mia is a struggling actress bouncing from audition to audition in a hopeless attempt to break through in LA's tough movie business. She makes ends meet as a Barista on the Warner Brother's lot. Meanwhile Sebastian is on a mission of his own: a talented musician, he is trying to restore jazz to the main stage (something the film's soundtrack will undoubtedly help do!) by opening his own classic jazz bar. As both strive for success on their own terms can love survive to deliver us the classic 'Hollywood ending'? The film is technically astonishing, with clever continuous shots of the ""Birdman"" variety and masterly cinematography (by Linus Sandgren of ""Joy"" and ""American Hustle""). The lighting team in particular is superb: a case in point is Mia's 'in-Seine' (sic) song, with breathtaking fades of the background to darkness, a camera whizz-around the actress for effect and then a brilliant fade back to reality. Loved it. Overall, there are enough similar moments in the film to make cinema-lovers like me gasp with delight.There's a curious timelessness about the piece which is surely deliberate. Whilst there are obvious and non-apologetic throwbacks to the classic musicals of the 50's like ""West Side Story"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" and references to ""Casablanca"" and ""Rebel without a Cause"", there is also a 60's vibe to the 'girls getting ready' sequence; an 80's A-ha cover thrown in at a pool party; and a Californian Prius obsession that is surely more 'noughties' than current. Most curiously, while everyone has smartphones no one seems to text anyone to announce changes to plans: the film is almost distancing itself from much of modern life.In the acting stakes Emma Stone again shines like a beacon. She is just magnetic on the screen: (tiny spoiler) the biggest plot hole in the film is why on earth she wasn't given the part for her first audition! I was disappointed she didn't win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Birdman"" in the ""87th Awards"" (she lost out to Patricia Arquette for ""Boyhood""): but she just keeps getting better and Better and BETTER. Ryan Gosling's confident and cocky turn also radiates charisma: in particular, it is astonishing that Gosling could play ""only a few chords"" on the piano before training for the film. A confidence boost for struggling piano learners everywhere. It is actually difficult to imagine two better actors for the roles. (Emma Watson allegedly turned it down for ""Beauty and the Beast"": something she might be kicking herself for!) Are they both the best singers and dancers when compared to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds (R.I.P.) or Cyd Charisse? No, undoubtedly not, but they have an undeniable charm all of their own. (Perhaps we will see the ilk of the great hoofers and crooners rise again with a resurgence in the classic musical. Can Hollywood take a hint?) The big question: now that both Stone and Gosling have won Golden Globes for acting in the ""Comedy or Musical"" category, can they convert that to Oscar glory where there is a single category in play? I'd like to think so. It's also great to see proper movie-making taking place in the Hollywood studios again: during my recent visits to LA there seemed to be little other than TV work going on in the main studio complexes there (although its worth pointing out that for this film not all of the filming was actually done on the Warner Brothers lot). Musicals are clearly measured by the quality of the music, and Justin Hurwitz (""Whiplash"") has produced a gem with – notwithstanding the jazz numbers and a catchy little pop number from John Legend – merely a handful of simple but unforgettable melodies that recur in different variations throughout the film. The soundtrack is already in my Amazon library and uplifting my mood on what is a damp and dreary Monday here in the UK.Damien Chazelle has delivered a triumph in both direction and original script. There is really very little I can fault the film on. In what was the somewhat patchy Coen brothers offering from last year – ""Hail Caesar"" – there was a standout moment of a throwback song and dance number with Channing Tatum that I raved about (you can find it on youtube). If I was being picky, then this tantalizing snippet would be a better representation of the style and vim of the original genre – – with the exception of the opening number, few of the song and dance numbers in ""La La Land"" quite get to that ""Broadway Melody"" level of scale and energy. This, together with a few concerns about the pacing in some places, led me to rate this as a 4.5 on first viewing.However on now seeing it twice within 36 hours, it's got me well and truly under its spell! I normally emotionally resist films that arrive with excessive hype but, in this case I give in. 10/10.(For the graphical version of this review, visit bob-the-movie-man.com)."
"La La Land is a triumph on so many levels. It hooks you from the beginning with its big opening number on the highway and has your heart fluttering in the club at the end. Damien Chazelle has proved himself to be one of the most talented directors/screenwriters in film right now.The film gets you with its charm. It flows from the dialogue like poetry. The chemistry between Stone and Gosling makes the film livelier. Stone has slowly shown herself as a force to be reckon with in Hollywood and now Gosling has join the ranks after his stellar performance as the jazz pianist who's main dream is watch jazz live on. Stone is a wanna be actress who can't find her way. Together, they thrive off each other's love and support as they try to accomplish their goals together. Each have a chance at their first Oscar gold.What else helps is a beautiful score and extremely well written songs. I found myself humming ""City of Stars"" all night long, already saving the soundtrack on every music platform I could. The music and dance numbers are a perfect blend of Gene Kelly musicals and more contemporary stuff like Chicago. The production design helps with this with bright, vivid colors abound from the walls of a passing building to Emma Stone's dress. A charming film only works when all cylinders click. This one was clockwork.Like Whiplash, the editing is superb, timing well with the score, making it very appealing to the eye. But the cinematography was mind blowing. Able to capture those big production numbers with long swift cuts made it very astonishing. Not a moment seemed overlooked or underdeveloped. Each scene was extremely well thought out to cause the biggest ""awe"" effect, or to provide strong symbolism. But the ending is what can really make or break a movie. This one makes it 10x better. It goes away from the predictable musical ending while wrapping up the movie in fellow swoop, opening the audiences' eyes to the entire meaning of the story, beyond the theme of follow your dreams. The idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them, but life isn't your own la la land. Everything does not end perfectly.When combining all these elements together, you get one of, if not the best film of the year. In a year where things became bitter, this really ends the year on a high note. Cheers to the dreamers, the men and women behind the making of this musical classic."
"I love musicals, but I must have missed the stand in the theater where they were handing our the kool-aid for this one. Based on the hype, I had high expectations. I went in thinking ""La La Land"" would be like ""An American in Paris"" or ""The Bandwagon,"" but once it started I realized it was more like ""One From the Heart,"" or ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" although both of those dismal failures had better music. In this film, Ryan Gosling plays a supercilious piano-playing bore who endlessly pontificates about ""jazz."" Emma Stone plays his vapid love interest, a star-struck barista who thinks she should be a movie star because she has a home filled with movie posters and her aunt once showed her ""Casablanca."" Once these two ciphers meet, the audience is subjected the kind of dreary conversation one flees from in real life.The musical score is deeply uninteresting. Emma and Ryan's hilltop dance is supposed to be reminiscent of Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse/Ginger Rogers, but comes closer to Teri Garr and Raul Julia in the aforementioned Coppola disaster. By the way, the film completely fails to capture L.A. in any way.Kudos to Emma and Ryan for trying to sing and dance, unfortunately proving that it takes MORE talent than they or most other Hollywood celebrities have to perform in a musical. However, I think that Damien Chazelle should be prevented from ever making another film musical. If you insist on subjecting yourself to an excruciatingly bad musical, try ""The Apple,"" which is a lot more fun and has better music. To check out good-to-great musicals, see the movies that ""inspired"" La La Land--the RKO Fred & Ginger movies and the MGM musicals from the 30's through 50""s. Even the recent straight-to-video ""Lucky Stiff"" leaves ""La La Land"" in the dust."
"What is everyone in this film singing and dancing about? Our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in LA. The opening musical number is painful to watch but I assume the story will improve.Our central characters are an actress who aspires to be a famous movie star and a musician who aspires to be a moody jazz pianist. She falls in love with him when she first hears him play his music. He falls in love with her as they begin to date and explore Hollywood. They soon trip head over heals in love and as if by magic they dance with bliss along the milky way. The only problem is - she soon reveals that she does not understand what is so great about jazz. (Wait - I thought she loved his music when she first heard him play?) So he explains the history of jazz and the poetry of the musician. That seems good enough and they continue their starry eyed romance. But her auditions are a bust. No work. Nothing changes. She has to write a one woman play to perform to demonstrate her craft. Yet he lands an opportunity to perform in a big band - the only problem is the music will be more upbeat pop funk jazz hybrid that will make him pretty good money but also take him away from his dreams to be the moody jazz pianist. He sells out to get work - and she stays true to herself and finds no work. This creates a schism and they have a very corny argument about creative direction. He does not understand what is wrong with him making money and traveling and being famous even if he truly knows that it sells out his dreams. She does not understand why she cannot get work even though she stays true to her dreams - and when her one woman show is a dud she decides to quit her dreams and move back home. Our dashing hero feels awful and soon learns that she has one final audition that awaits and so he drives to her home in Nevada to tell her that she must return for one final audition. They travel back to LA - she sings at her audition - and she gets the role. Both have their own careers now - so they split up. Five years later - she is a famous movie star married with children and he has his own jazz club where he lives his dreams as a moody jazz pianist. One night by happenstance - she stumbles into the club and finds him. He plays a solo piano song and she has a dream where their entire love affair is relived only all the choices which led to their separation are made differently and they stay together and have a family and discover their dreams as a couple. Suddenly, she understands what his words meant so long ago - about the history of jazz - the poetry of the musician - now everything comes full circle - and they have a longing final glance. This is all cool - don't get me wrong. But the story itself has been told so many times its clichés are even clichéd. The songs and dialogue are very uneven and at times the film is incoherently stupid. Really - do young couples talk about why they would sell out their dreams to make thousands of dollars a month? Also, the big red flag with the story is that the music simply is not very good. There is not one memorable song or dance in the entire film! Mostly the lights and costumes replace any real choreography or musical number with a unique visual cue. Also, Ryan Gosling is poorly cast as a jazz pianist. It just does not feel real at all that Gosling is so, so sad in LA with his poor dreams of being a jazz pianist so hard to recognize as he dates lovely women.What exactly is the purpose of this film? What was everyone singing and dancing about? Do we live in a world where people can fly down to LA and pursue their dreams with a shot like yesteryear? Or do we live in a world where educational alliances, corporate oligarchy, family connections, and the occasional marriage - determine who gets to shine in the lights? Are we as a people supposed to rejoice that the song and dance of old Hollywood musicals had a tribute film made just in time for the Oscar season? I dunno - this movie does have some strong moments in the script - and it does have some good acting - costumes - and lights - but I just think it's corny and I could not care less."
"I was greatly looking forward to this movie.I had read many reviews and  they all seemed very positive.In fact when I read my newspaper's  critique is was given 4/4 which is unusual. How let down I am. This was  the worst movie I have seen this year.And we saw it in a VIP theatre.It  was so slow moving that I felt myself falling asleep. I kept looking at  my watch saying ""only another 1/2 hour."" Ryan Gosling cannot really  sing & dance.And Emma Stone may be very photogenic & a good actress but  she also is not much of a singer/dancer.There are wonderful musicals  such as The amazing ""West Side Story"",the wonderful ""Grease' Chicago  was terrific to watch also as well as ""Hairspray"" with Jennifer Hudson  & 'Mama Mia"" with Meryl Streep.But this mess was a dud. The plot was  simple but its execution was a dismal failure.I cannot figure out all  the accolades this movie is getting from the Golden Globes,critics,&  user reviews. A few hours after this film,I cant really remember  anything worthwhile.Do not waste your money on this film whatever the  critics say.It is boring,non believable,& you wont really care about  the characters."
"You know when you're watching a film that you just don't want to end, and when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again right there and then? I had that feeling with La La Land, the new film from Damien Chazelle, who blew us all away with Whiplash a few years ago.With La La Land, Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy-drama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears. If you haven't heard of this film yet (where have you been?), I'm sure you will do in the coming months.Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film stars while Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist playing a small time bar to make ends meet. The two meet and fall in love but it's their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apart.The most striking thing about La La Land is just how beautifully crafted a film it is; the story, performances, music, dance numbers and cinematography all playing their part in making this such an unforgettable cinematic experience. I genuinely can't find one single fault in this film.Chazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young filmmaker, writing and directing such a touching and often funny love story with a meticulous energy. The whole feel of the film is a throwback to the golden age of musicals, a decision a lot of filmmakers would have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively satisfying. The gorgeous cinematography from Linus Sandgren brings the city of Los Angeles to life, awash with colour, while his swift camera-work, including some impressive long takes, in particular through the dance numbers, immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike musical.Coming to the performances, La La Land features two superb lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, both giving arguably their best performance to date. Gosling has really grown on me as an actor, maturing into one of the best in the business today. He proved earlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in The Nice Guys and he proves it yet again here. Stone always manages to impress me and she is dazzling in La La Land, singing and dancing her way into our hearts. The pair share an undeniable chemistry and I would love to see them both get the recognition they deserve come awards season.Justin Hurwitz's score and the original songs in La La Land, along with the wonderfully choreographed dance sequences, including a great opening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film, heighten the film's level of originality, maintaining that energy Chapelle's films possess.I dare you to try and not fall in love with La La Land. I fell in love with it and I'm sure many more will do so too."
"Sorry but I grew up living and loving musicals but this is tripe. None of the ""stars"" are of the expected style or standard. The story is grotesquely poor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I kept wanting someone to slam the keyboard cover down on his hands, Stones voice left me praying for a good dose of pharyngitis. In short neither can sing or dance yet the Hollywood promo machine keep telling us how great it is and people believe it. In short i wasted 2 hours, 7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life. For our Australian summer releases it rates nearly as bad as Passengers.Don't bother wasting the ticket money."
"Wow, I just cannot believe all the accolades this movie is getting. The only reason why it must be getting all these awards is that is is a movie about Hollywood, and Hollywood loves itself very much. The acting is vapid, the dancing mediocre, the songs forgettable, the singing abysmal. Everyone sounds like a bad choir audition-- weak, breathy, without focus or ""ring"". No legit Broadway-style singing technique. I cannot imagine what real Broadway singers and dancers must be thinking about this travesty.I think it must be an exercise in navel-gazing, as the awards bodies see themselves in these two characters. Haven't they all struggled to get auditions? Haven't they all had screen tests? Haven't they all tried to ""make it"" in Hollywood? of course they have. The awards givers like looking at themselves in the mirror. Personally I do not like what they see. Don't bother wasting your energy, or you will quit halfway through, as I did. 0 out of 10."
"A old couple left 30 minutes in. I couldn't understand the music, I couldn't hear the lyrics. Ryan Gosling's character was a dick for 90% of the movie. He is a good actor, but my goodness his character is an ass hat. The story to me was blah. It was like I've see this story told before just differently. Emma Stone is amazing. I definitely enjoyed her more than Ryan's character, but that honestly isn't too hard. The movie seemed pretentious and over rated as a whole. It was just Hollywood getting off on Hollywood. Imagine if Hollywood was a person and cloned themselves. Then Hollywood starts sucking Hollywoods dick. There, that's most of the story. White man tries to save jazz. I did enjoy the visuals, editing, colours and dancing. So it was nice to look at, I'll give it that. But the story to me was under whelming."
"This film will disappoint you. Here are the reasons why:1. Its apparently supposed to be a movie musical, yet BOTH RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE SINGERS. I couldn't quite get past this point. It is astonishing that two below par singers could be casted in a movie musical? It is a heavy contradiction to the genre of film it attempts to portray.2. Both RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE DANCERS. Similar to the singing complaint, i was unable to be captivated and fully immerse myself in the movie/musical 'magic' because i was too busy cringing at their dance performance.3. The STORYLINE WAS NOT CAPTIVATING. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, because of respective careers they don't end up together? Fin4. THE STORYLINE WENT FLAT IN THE MIDDLE. The middle of the film dragged, for obvious reasons which is that the story line was to weak to maintain the intensity.5. RYAN GOSLING'S CHARACTER IS ACTUALLY VERY ANNOYING A jazz fanatic that forces it down everybody's throat, including the girl he is dating. He was superior to others because of his love for jazz. He thrust jazz upon her, and because of that i never really for once believed in the film that she had organically grown to love jazz as her love for him also developed. Instead it seemed as if she had to pretend to like jazz as a pre- condition to their relationship.6. The HYPE AROUND THIS FILM DOES NOT MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FILM The expectations were simply way to high for this average film. I mean, it has 8.6 on IMDb for goodness sake!!Although it is subjective, in my opinion, this film comes nowhere close to a great film or musical. In conclusion, shame on 'Hollywood' and so many once respected critics endorsing this film as one of, if not the 'greatest musicals' of all time. Furthermore, shame on movie lovers and society in general not having the balls to suggest the clear truth which is that this is clearly a very average film at best. Big Shame!"
"Well done the marketing department for creating a buzz around this film. The first comments I read in the newspapers said this was an uplifting life affirming experience. So how come my husband and I left the cinema feeling thoroughly depressed with the ending. The film was slow, boring and didn't have much to say. The opening sequence looked promising but turned out to be an unconnected piece of entertainment that wasn't repeated in the movie. It was left to Stone and Gosling to stumble along with short bits of dancing and very shaky vocals. Didn't detect any magical reaction from the audience who shuffled out in silence. Don't believe the hype this is a just OK film probably a 5.4 rating would be nearer the truth."
"While looking forward to seeing this film but having no real expectations, the film was excruciatingly painful to sit through and I like musicals. Being a former film student,I found this film slow, boring, uneventful and at least an hour too long with unappealing characters. At a point in the film, Ryan Gosling's character looks out over L.A. and says ""not much to look at"". I said to my wife, ""my thoughts exactly"" (referring to the film-not L.A.). This made musicals like 'Lost Horizon' and 'At Long Last Love' look like cinematic greatness (and I enjoyed those). They certainly don't make them like they used to."
"An observatory, a boulevard, a bridge, a downtown trolley, all make up filming locations of the new film ""La La Land"". These locations are iconic, yet remain unnamed throughout the film. The sum of these locations create the city of Los Angeles. Any meaningful production is a sum of its cast members and in the case of ""La La Land"" there is no difference. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) come together to create a wonderful production, but a lesser known yet ever present cast member is the city itself. Throughout the epic musical sequences, the city in its whole is either visible or represented by its historic street lights. Some might argue that the city is a backdrop to the songs and dancing of Sebastian and Mia but the city itself takes center stage with the vibrancy of a leading man. It lends its beauty to be danced upon by Sebastian and Mia without relinquishing its hold as being the center of attention. Mia being a minor actress in Hollywood goes to casting calls where those auditioning look the same. This image of Hollywood conformity lends itself to the character of Sebastian who has to change his performance identity much in the same way Mia has done in order to fit in and make a living in the beast that is Hollywood. With this being said the performances of Mia and Sebastian are one of a kind, lending itself to a sort of fantasy adaptation of falling in love. The imagery of the film stops at nothing to convey the idea of love and the concept of a soulmate, while the business aspects of Hollywood coupled with the necessity of survival keeps the two characters at odds. The film represents a city, a city that often times is at odds with itself; a city that identifies talent based on familiarity rather than the unique and often overlooked aspects that create it. Ultimately ""La La Land"" is a story about conforming and not conforming and the gains that can be had in between. LA is marketed as the land of dreams, yet is often overlooked and stacked on a pile of dreams that will never come to fruition. The film explores the idea of ""what if"", and tackles the idea of a working Hollywood versus a Hollywood where the idea of art is paramount. ""La La Land"" focuses on the idea of money versus art, and shows that nobel aspects of creativity are often ignored to focus on the monetary aspects of the industry while leaving behind the very art that drove them in the first place. The movie is very much paced in the realm of Hollywood where the cadence of the film is action packed with all the fervor of a young person entering Hollywood for the first time, yet as Mia and Sebastian learn the inter-workings of Hollywood the film slows down to reflect the realities that are faced when having to juggle income and art. ""La La Land"" reignites a fire that has been lost from a Hollywood that is so focused on relaunches and reboots. It's refreshing to see a totally unique film, especially one that grasps the nature of Hollywood and Los Angeles in such an unconventional way. The singing, the dancing and cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of something larger than life. The long musical sequences often border on the surreal, taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars. Yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring, this is quickly remedied, but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing. Watching ""La La Land"" is like being awake during a wondrous dream, there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian as well as the visuals of Los Angeles that surround them. As he sits at his piano, Sebastian sweetly and softly sings Mia a love song, a powerful couple of lines that represent love, art and life. ""City of Stars, are you shining just for me, City of Stars there so much that I can see, Who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new, Or one more dream that I cannot make true."" With ""La La Land"" a dream has come true, and made its way onto the big screen."
"What a great movie! Who would have thought anyone could bring the original screen musical back from the dead? Yet here it is, hale and hearty.The music is melodic but never simplistic; the lyrics are intelligent and intelligible; the script is funny, touching without ever resorting to sentimentality; the two leads are not only skillful but full of a kind of charm that I honestly thought had disappeared entirely from American movies: but here we have Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just oozing it.The only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine dance routines and over-reliance on the device of lights dimming on set to isolate an actor in white light, but that's me being r-e-a-l-l-y picky. It may well be that this is the best musical written directly for the screen since SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.All credit to writer-director Damien Chazelle and his team - and it really feels like a team-movie - for giving us this gem. Sure it's a feelgood piece, but it creates a world which is complex, it acknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters, it connects with people's passions, and in the case of Ms Stone's big solo, ""Audition"", it has a bona fide classic."
"Tone of the movie wavers between serious and quirky, never making a definitive choice; as such it succeeds at neither. Far too many ""homages"" to other movies to stand on its own. Tries to play on LA stereotypes, but the commentary on them only comes across as ""making sure each cliché is thrown in the movie somewhere,"" thereby ensuring that the movie itself exemplifies the most prevalent LA stereotype: style over substance. Liked the ""alternate reality"" sequence if only for the fact that it was the one moment in the movie where it tried to say something interesting about life and because I could pretend to be in some other reality where I wasn't watching this movie."
"**Big SPOILER ALERT** Was looking forward to this film, but had to watch in agony from its beginning as a Pepsi commercial to its ending as a Coca Cola commercial. Shocking that this pallid film is being feted for something it is not. Emma Stone, someone who is hard to watch in long extreme closeups throughout the film and Ryan Gosling exhibit no charisma or charm. Their dancing tries to be cute and romantic but is clumsy. The music is dirge-like and not uplifting. The producers should have used more professional musical performers, ones who can inspire when they sing and/or dance. Gosling talks about jazz throughout the film, but we hardly hear any good jazz, especially not the jazz greats he talks about. So how are we to know what is the great jazz that inspired him? His friend says ""Jazz is the future."" But in reality it's the present, being created as it's played. All of a sudden, Stone, the aspiring actress who shows no acting talent whatsoever, decides to become a playwright without showing any ability or work, except for having an apartment covered with photos of classic movie stars. The banal dialogue, superficial characters and overly long scenes are embarrassments. Stone comes into her old coffee shop and asks for two iced coffees. Immediately a guy standing there puts down a tray with two iced coffees in front of her. Glaring continuity problem there. Throughout the film in almost every scene there is nary a person who is over thirty. The casting people never cared to hire people who reflected the real world, fantasy or not. If the music had been tuneful and clever, the film would be somewhat better. As it is it is dull. he characters exist in a vacuum with no backstory. Only interesting aspect to this film is some of the recognizable Hollywood locations, but locations do not a film make. If anyone still watches the self-aggrandizing Academy Awards, it will be cringe-worthy if this film wins any awards except for production manager or art director. It's a sad state of affairs that this film is considered in high esteem. That accolade belongs to ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""The Band Wagon,"" ""Gigi,"" ""Oklahoma,""""South Pacific,"" ""Top Hat,""""Wizard of Oz,"" and films by Astaire, Kelly, Powell, Miller, Charisse, Garland, Crosby, Sinatra, Grable, Keel, and all the great stars who truly were musical comedy class acts. Their talents made even B films a joy to watch."
"The new Hollywood musical with the intriguing title ""La-La-Land one of the most talked about motion pictures in recent years with two of Hollywood's most attractive and popular younger generation stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, can best be summed up in a single three syllable word ~~. PA-THE-TIC!-- Gosling, in spite of a name that makes one think of goose liver, is indeed quite handsome in the traditional Hollywood leading man mold, but when it comes to acting or personality he is no Cary Grant or Jimmy Dean, and as far as dancing goes he couldn't carry the jock strap of either Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire. His love interest and dancing partner, Emma Stone, a lissome (skinny) redhead with gigantic blue eyes, and no breasts to speak of, is a much better dancer, and generally a far better actor, but seems to have aged considerably since her extraordinarily vivid interpretation of a sexy young college co-ed in love with her murderous philosophy prof in Woody Allen's ""Irrational Man"" just two years ago. In this picture she is in facial closeup much of the time but looks haggard, worn, and older than she is supposed to according to the story. The dance numbers seem to be an attempt at a homage to Astaire and Ginger Rogers in slow motion, but they are so badly set and choreographed that after a while they just become annoying. One particular Gosling Stone duet set in the L.A. Planetarium is so ridiculous with them antigravitationally traipsing on thin air against a galaxy of stars that it is downright embarrassing. The young lovers are clearly meant for. each other but their divergent career dreams and aspirations, she as an actress he as a Charley Parker type serious jazz musician, keep them apart in the wake of arbitrary script manipulations that seem so phony you get the feeling the actors had to keep asking themselves, ""Hold on a sec --what were we supposed to be doing in that last scene?"" Pathetic scripting, pathetic unmotivated dance scenes arbitrarily inserted, then ineptly executed -- pathetic unfocused direction - no wonder Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) have such pained expressions on their pretty faces all the time. I actually felt sorry for Emma in some scenes suspecting that she may have been physically unwell while going through the motions. I kept looking at my watch wondering if this thing was ever going to end. The running time was 128 minutes but it felt more like five hours. The final credits with handsome art-deco lettering were a great relief when they finally came up and put this picture out if its misery. No more Damien Chazelle for me. He also directed another sado-masochistic abomination entitled ""Whiplash"". Give me Mondo Cane ... Bottom line: A film almost as dopey as its dumbbell La-dee-da title."
"I went to this film with the expectation that I would be seeing a 'modern musical with a nostalgic twist'. This expectation was delivered but generally in a mediocre way. The much touted opening number was a technically accomplished cinematographic feat but the setting and choreography was rather bland and boring (I struggled to hear and care about the song for this number).I found the 'repartee' between the two leads was a bit mumbled and not particularly witty or fun. The dancing was very average and the songs and singing unmemorable (Mia and Seb's theme was bland and not what you would expect a jazz enthusiast to come up with). Apart from the two leads, there were no other memorable characters or performances.There was never a moment when I felt joy watching any of the scenes, which I suppose was the reason why I was most disappointed with the film.A few interesting LA landmarks were showcased in the film but, again, the interesting settings were not really exploited by the choreography. For example, Mia and/or Seb could have danced on the round balcony at the observatory (what you would have expected a Fred or Gene to have done). If this was not allowed on the real balcony, the balcony could have been re-created on a set.Ryan Gosling did not convey any great passion for either jazz or Mia, most of his facial expressions made it seem that he was a martyr to mild indigestion. He spoke a lot about his passions but you need to show this cinematically.I enjoyed Emma Stone's performance much more. Some of her audition scenes were good and her performance of her last audition song was good (I thought the song itself was just OK).To summarize, one of the few films that I was tempted to walk out on (but I was in the middle of a row), and one that I will never be tempted to watch again."
"Bottom-line: Once upon a time there was the American musical which could inspire the world by wielding great visuals, music, story and characters. Today we have the perfect lobotomy instrument called La La Land. I began theorizing that it would only be possible to understand the praise and delight of the general populace if lobotomy would have been performed on a universal scale. I know not of any such undertaking and I'm no fan of conspiracy theories. Alas, I have to assume that there are shortcomings of mine which do not let me enjoy this so called jewel of a movie which purportedly restores the glamour of the Golden Era of Hollywood.Plus points: 1) Pretty Emma Stone, who can actMinus points: 1) Emma Stone can't sing, 2) Emma Stone can't dance too well, 3) Ryan Gosling can't sing or dance, 4) Weak plot delivered in a unbelievable manner, 5) Silly and overused musical score, 6) Uninteresting dialogue, 7) No character depth and actually no chemistry between the two protagonists. Overall feel to the movie was that of silliness beyond measure. My personal reaction was that of uncontrolled, roaring laughter. It is strange indeed that while I cried at the ""funny"" moments, I laughed at the ""sad"" and ""serious"" moments. I have to admit that rarely have I laughed this way during a movie. The ratings and nominations are oftentimes so unfair to real cinematic talent that I had to give a 1 (one) mark for the balance. It is really sad that the Renaissance of the American musical is trumpeted by this hollow shell of a movie."
"If you see the first scene you have seen the hole movie. It is a love story that have no beginning. It starts without any script. It is a nonsense o story without reasons and plot. It is just a accumulation of songs and scenes, and for most they are not very impressive. The result. A very very boring picture. After the first hour I realize that it will be a real challenge to finish the film. I was so so so boring. It is impossible to spoiler this film cause have no plot at all. So If you are smart listen to the music at spotify. It is the only thing that it is worth to be heard or watched of this movie."
"This movie won awards and praised by some, so the chances are that you are going to see it eventually...As a musical it lacks good music and good choreography. It draws inspiration by classics like Singing in the rain and West Side Story but it can't compete with any of these masterpieces and it doesn't offer anything new in the genre.In terms of acting Emma Stone is very good, showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from Ryan Gosling who adds to the sad tone that the movie will eventually reach.The plot it starts as a satire of todays (and past and maybe future) Los Angeles, which is full of waitresses who want to be famous actresses and struggling musicians who have their own dreams to make it in a very competitive world.Later it becomes a romantic story (not only for relationships but also for dreams and wishes) but in its final act the movie takes a serious dramatic turn where the two ""happy"" endings are combining to a depressing conclusion, that even the final two reassuring nods can't repair. Add to this an alternate timeline flashback that the director/writer wanted to incorporate to his vision, and you end up with an overall depressing movie that actually ruins the optimistic feeling and the romance that initially had.Overall: Depressing. Mediocre forgettable music. A classic story that ends up in a melancholic, yet pragmatical, way.."
"I'm sorry but I just don't get the adulation for this very bland, very boring musical. I watched it with a lot of anticipation with my partner and both she and I were bored enough to consider giving up.The opening sequence was like a James Bond opening sequence. It had nothing to do with the actual film and was the best part.I'm a very big musical fan and it's difficult to think of one I haven't seen. This one has an original score and isn't a film version of a Broadway musical so should not be compared too closely to films like Mamma Mia or Les Miserables but can be compared to Singing in The Rain, High Society and to a certain extent Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, Cabaret, etc., which were produced in an age where Theatregoing was a rich persons pastime.In every comparison, this film fails. The music is insipid and totally forgettable. The acting is OK but the main characters dancing would not have got them past week two of Strictly Come Dancing. The biggest fault with the movie is the complete lack of supporting actors to flesh out the story. The two main characters are just not strong enough to carry the movie for more than two hours without help. I'm talking about actors like Anne Hathaway (Les Mis.), Joel Grey (Cabaret), Stockard Channing (Grease), George Chakiris (West Side Story), Donald O'Conner (Singing In The Rain). The list goes on and on. In this film all we got were cameos by John Legend and a totally wasted J K Simmons (would love to have seen him sing and dance!!).So! Sorry for being a spoilsport but I just cannot see what all the fuss is about"
"A film that fails the Turing test - in reverse. Or something. What I mean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawled over me that I was participating in a rather sinister experiment, watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attempting to provoke a human-like response. Stuffed with algorithms culled from proper movies and musicals, the computer has generated a script and a set of scenarios based on user-preference and targeted directly at my very own demographic! Its eerie; the songs sound like songs but aren't quite, the dialogue sounds like people but not quite, nothing that happens has a real reason or point other than to crank through the plot, the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isn't, quite, and the set-ups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left me untouched and feeling slightly hollow. What has been thrown, hurled and heaved at this film is Oscar-seeking acting, Oscar-seeking direction and Oscar-seeking technical twiddling. And hey ho and guess what, it got Oscars. Its the apotheosis of junk food, finally. You don't even need to make the effort to chew; it can now just squirt directly into you via the eyes and ears, a simulacrum of nourishment, over-flavoured glop taking the name of real love, real music, real acting and real life in vain."
"In Whiplash, Chazelle's first feature, excellent cinematography, editing, music and design combined with great acting and gripping scenes. However, it was marred by some serious disconnects with realism while purporting to be essentially realistic: some of the character psychologies and story logic were stretched too thin. Ultimately, one could enjoy the acting and the edit/shot rhythms, and forgive the flaws.Those same flaws from his first picture absolutely devastate La La Land, and they aren't counterbalanced by much more than two very good set pieces (Gosling and Stone's number while he walks her to her car, and Stone's audition number).There is not an interesting conflict in a scene for the first ninety minutes of this movie. Much of the early tension is based on two good-looking 'characters' who ""don't like each other"", and on them coincidentally running into each other a few times. ALL of the later conflict between the two main characters hinges on conveniently concocted scene logic that boils down to fighting and breaking up instead of simple solutions like a) sending a text or b) getting out of a work thing or c) saying ""I'll see you in a few months"". The logic flaws and wholly unearned story points are so bad that it's not really a story; it's more of a unpolished frame to hang a bunch of set pieces on. It intends to be a string of pearls.But when half of those set pieces are mediocre, particularly the opening number, one is left with uncomfortable waits between the good parts: the story and characters are nothing, and half of the scenes neither deepen the story nor wholly delight. It makes you aware of your butt on the chair in the theater.Maybe worst of all is this movie's attempt to do with motion blur what Easy Rider did with lens flares. The difference is that 'avoid lens flares' was just a rule about 'professional' cinematography that was broken by a few rebels in the right movie for that. Motion blur is a fairly upsetting thing to look at, let alone on a big screen for shots that last two or three seconds, repeated seven or eight times in the movie. One of them is quite effective: up to some palm trees, 180 degree twist, and back down to the leads as they walk around a fountain. And there are some simple whip pans that are too fast to be upsetting. But this leaves multiple medium-speed motion blur pans, and the movie loses more than it could gain, multiple times, by breaking this rule. (If you feel that there is no 'rule' that says not to do long motion-blur shots when they don't add anything, I'll grant you your point, and counter by saying that the movie looks hideous and nauseating during those shots)"
"My summary basically says it all. I had so been looking forward to seeing this movie particularly as l love musicals - but am sad to say that I was hugely disappointed. It started brightly enough with the traffic jam dance scene - but from there on in it was all downhill for me. I felt the whole film was terribly disjointed and it felt like they were trying too hard to recreate the magical musicals of years gone by. The singing was poor - and the 'dancing' - if you could call it that - equally uninspiring. Some reviewers have even gushed about this being one of the 'greatest musicals' of all-time. What?? Have they never seen West Side Story, Grease, or any of the old Hollywood greats? Obviously no, otherwise they would never have made such a stupid statement. For me this was 2 hours of ZZzzzzz."
"Spoilers spoilers spoilers...if you haven't seen it yet don't read thisOkay first of all I dint want to see this movie. From the little things I heard I saw it looked like the typical musical same as all others musicals as clichéd as it could get and boring....But many of my friends wanted to see it and I said hey maybe it could be watchable...well it wasn't.It starts with this hideous musical piece with the friends of Emma stone dancing and it looked like Glee....Retarted and empty...The next songs wasn't that bad but still not good at all. Boring, the usual musical songs that you'd expect to here stuck in a 50s or whatever the era was aesthetics even though it is freaking 2017 the choreographic the same thing that takes you back many decades and has absolutely nothing to add to the present. In the dancing scene in the hill the 2 main characters could barely lift their feet from the ground and that looked really lame.... The plot was no different than that of a thousand other romantic, drama, comedy and musical movies that exist.... The movie is 2 hours 8 minutes long but it felt like 4 hours. Toni Erdmann is 2h 40 min. and it felt like a 1 hour movie....I really wanted to leave the cinema because it was so boring and its parts didn't add together. I felt like I was watching 4 movies put together in a very sloppy and in a way that didn't make a bit of sense. Near the end were Emma Stone sang for an audition me and my friends laughed our ass off because she was lisping a lot....We were literary crying from laughter... Also I don't think you can call it a musical because it had like 10 minutes of singing and dancing...To sum up a borefest as stereotyped as a movie can get, it's so bad so nonsensical that many times feels like a parody or a comedy, the dialogue is really awful, very bad music choreography is lame, costumes are a tribute to these of many decades ago and the ones Emma Stone wore looked like the ones you buy from cheap Chinese stores.... And finally the plot didn't make any sense and even if it did it's so corny that it seems that a 15 year old girl wrote... Just don't watch this thing... Jesus"
"I don't usually write negative reviews. But since this movie is stealing all the awards so far, and some people are calling that dull & cheesy film ""a masterpiece"" I felt forced to write something. LLL is a movie made from plastic. It is full of clichés and a it has a fake aroma of nostalgia.The beginning does have neither weight nor meaning. The director only wants to tell us here, in case we don't notice afterwards, that this movie is a musical. Good for him, because who could have guessed that with all the bad singing and the bad dancing!The love story is completely predictable and fake for the first hour or so, until the first fight.Somebody has said that this film is a super-white film about 2 ""baby-dreamers"", and I completely agree. Where is the Art? Where is the real struggle? There are today millions of people dying from hunger, wars, violence, and incurable diseases, and to sink because a play didn't turn out how you expected or you cannot be the jazz pianist number one is really childish. Good things: the cinematography and the flashbacks are very good. The end is the best. That turn is actually original but does not make any sense any way. Let's not forget that the girl and the boy are where they are because she was depressed for her career failure. So, the turn does not actually make any sense. The jazz is good too (I mean, the REAL jazz musicians). And Ryan Gosling (who is OK in the film but not amazing) is actually playing the piano, which, in a Hollywood movie is already a lot. Annoying things: the worst is, in my opinion, Emma Stone. I never understood her ""talent"". She is just a ""pretty"" face with a skinny (anorexic?) body who seems to think she is too good to prepare for her roles. Her singing & dancing are awful. Let's remember that in Irrational Man (I love Woody Allen!) she didn't even bother taking a piano lesson for her role of ""pianist"". Her hairdo is very annoying (she always seems to have just come out from the hairdresser) and I never understood why she cannot appear in even one frame without make up. How this mediocre actress won the Golden Globe for BP by an Actress in a MP - Musical or Comedy in stead of the amazing Meryl Streep or the amazing Annette Bening shows how Hollywood is losing it. And the fact that she won the SAG Award (Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role) in stead of Meryl Streep or Natalie Portman shows how this movie has blinded Hollywood. The most hilarious thing would be that she wins the Oscar (and, sadly, she probably will), being in the same category as Ruth Negga (who made an stunning performance in Loving), Meryl Streep (always amazing and always great), Natalie Portman and Isabelle Huppert (one of the best European actresses of today). But, hey, if Sandra Bullock got and Oscar in 2010, Stone could definitely get one too!Gosling can play the piano but he definitely cannot sing: his voice does not have any power and it sounds like olive oil. His dancing is, as his partner's, mediocre. How come he ended wining the Golden Globe for BP by an Actor in a MP - Musical or Comedy in stead of Hugh Grant (who gave his best performance ever in FFJ) is a real mystery. Luckily, and for the sake of Art, he didn't get the SAG Award (who went to the amazing Denzel). The clichés of LLL are endless: girl meets boy and at first they hate each other but after they like each other. The detail with the famous actress who enters in the Café is also predictable. And how rude (not cool) is to refuse an invitation! There are lots of holes in the movie. Boy and girl keep bumping into each other in a city as huge as LA, and many more, but I am not going to tell them because I don't want to reveal the plot and turns of the movie. 14 Oscar nominations? Give me a break! As somebody said, it's the endless story about Hollywood in love with itself. Pity, I will definitely not watch the Oscars this year. There were lots of really great movies this year and they did not get 14 Oscar nominations: Collateral Beauty, Loving, Hidden Figures, Lion, Moonlight, Elle, Florence Foster Jenkins, Smrt u Sarajevu, Fences... LLL should have got 1 Oscar nomination only (cinematography, Sandgren).The whole movie, even if it features some great black jazz musicians, has a white-ish taste that is unbearable. I don't care AT ALL if the actors are white, black, yellow, orange or green. But this cheesy movie with 2 black actors definitely wouldn't have got 14 Oscars nominations. Why? Because from the 6,000 Academy members, 73% are men, 27% women; 89% are white, and only 11% are people of color. The age average is 60 years old (that can explain the love for this mediocre musical (I would not call it a musical, because in the musicals the actors actually know to sing and know to dance). The world is, sadly, still very racist. That's why many people are calling this film White White Land for a reason. That LLL is stealing all the awards and probably will also steal many Oscars shows the decadency of cinema today in the US. Either that or people are really bored and need an empty and cheesy love story to be entertained. I think that Hollywood should learn from that reality that European cinema knows to depict, away from clichés and empty love stories, away from pretty actors with fake hairdos and plastic bodies. If LLL has achieved something is that: a new line of decadence, clichés, and cheesiness in American cinema."
"Thought this would be a dandy New Years film. Just days before, when Debbie Reynolds passed away I spent time watching the classic dance/song numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Yes, the film's opening number was a fine homage to musicals of the golden age. Then, I could not help but compare Ryan and Emma's lack luster amateur dance efforts to the amazing talents of such as Debbie, Donald and Gene Kelly. Blah versus excellence. Next, I had to endure Ryan trying to sing, total failure. Emma a notch better but again not ready for prime time. No one left the theater humming anything close to an unforgettable tune. Time for me to again start humming Singin' in the Rain.The 'story' moved at snails pace for the most part. A major plot whole when a character makes a major, life altering decision which is totally ignored as if it never happened. Perhaps there is a missing scene on the cutting room floor since this then permitted an alternate ending which, of course, made no sense.Finally, many others are right to note the lack of chemistry between Ryan and Emma.To vote anything close to an 8.9 you need memorable songs, great chemistry, ever greater singing and dance talents plus a story that makes sense rather then contradicting itself. Sadly, I found all these qualities totally lacking."
"This film starts with a great promise. We follow a musician and an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles. The film's title is a reference both to a nickname for the city of Los Angeles and to the idiom for being out of touch with reality. But where it fails it all the rest. The movie is well acted no doubt, but the subject, you care less and less. And even if you want to, this film is a 90 minutes romantic comedy that turns out to be 130... even Woody Allen will think it's too much, i want the shorter version. I was bored to death and i'm a huge fan of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Work... here I try, but can't ! It's just too long !"
"I went to see the movie because it was 8.7 in IMDb and somebody said its the best movie he has seen since Star Wars when he was 6.... Well we were 2 couples and we left after 30 minutes....Its an awful movieIf you are not into musicals and if you liked Whiplash do yourself a favor. Take a good book and stay home.Its boring, the plot is dull, it is slow and the opposite of inspiring or interesting ....The beginning of the movie has a scene as if inspired by West Side Story... But this is not LEonard Bernstein and the music does not meet the level... Yet, I thought its a Good start..At some point it becomes more interesting and something is happening... but then it is cut and slowed down by a romantic song in the middle of some action and the movie falls down again...This movie does not deserve to be in the top 100 of IMDb... Help me to take it down... You will thank me for the warning"
"Saying that this film is a Musical is like saying The Martian is a comedy. I found the film extremely slow moving and it did not hold my attention. The story line was weak and it had me hoping it would improve. It did not improve and I walked out with about 40 minutes of the film remaining. Considering the exceptional reviews and ratings this film has been getting I was sorely disappointed. Films like Singing in the Rain are musicals. This is not even a fraction of a musical. I am an avid film goer and consider that I have enough musical knowledge, coming from a musical background, to give such judgments. I notice one other reviewer stated this could be classed as a poor man's Woody Allen film and I totally agree. Last year I saw The Cafe Society and this had far greater costumes, acting, depth and music ."
"This movie is not good. The high reviews are probably studio people or friends and family of all the cast & crew involved in this film! I really like both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, but neither can carry a tune in this movie! I'm not saying these two needed to be Shirley Jones and Frank Sinatra, but at least find 2 people that can sing!! We know Emmy Rossum can sing and they could have cast Patrick Wilson. For a musical, it's not just star power, the leads have to be able to sing! (or at least dub some beautiful voice in, like they did for Natalie Wood in West Side Story).Plus, the story is quite boring and very slow. Girl meets boy, girl gets boy. Girl loses boy. (Yawn!!) Then there's the issue of maybe only one semi-catchy tune, add that to the boring story and you've got yourself a snooze-fest. Which no self respecting ""musical"" should ever be. JK Simmons is really good in the 2-3 minutes he's in the movie, but no one else is even remotely memorable. In a role any male actor could have played, they waste Tom Everett Scott. By the way, the opening production number is very clever, but the song is not good by any means. I've already forgotten the tune or even the name of the song! The story isn't worth summarizing here as it's too boring to repeat. Very, very disappointing! Don't waste your money and wait for it to hit cable."
"OK it is a 6ish Movie. But Look at the ratings. The rating totally misleads the audiences and I don't think a good movie maker should do that. If you want to make a 9-star movie. Make it not fake it.The movie has the unbelievable boring start and this lasts for 2/3 of the movie. The whole movie hardly has any story so don't expect any amazing story or something, there is none. Just couple fall in love had one fight and separates. The movie deserves a 6 because it is really good at sharing the lovers' feelings. But one good thing doesn't make it a 9 star for sure.Please do not cheat the audiences."
"If a producer is going to deconstruct a genre, the producer owes it to the audience to warn them early on (like in ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" or ""Unforgiven""). This film, which has been lavishly praised, earns my visceral hatred because it did not do so, and I frankly cannot recall a movie which has ever triggered that sort of reaction even though I have seen thousands of them.I went to this movie because I was in the mood for a warm, ""feel good"" movie. The promo's and a goodly part of the film deliver that ""feel good"" warmth, like The Artist, but this time, as an updated classic song-and-dance film of the 1930's to 1950's. You can also see the homages, like those to Astaire/Rodgers and Kelly, as well as a knowing glance to a key scene in ""Rebel Without a Cause"". Sounds just like what I wanted.But about two-thirds of the way through, something begins to change (no spoilers here). The crack widens until the end, which at least one review has called bittersweet. For me, I felt rage. I got conned, without warning, into seeing the kind of movie I did not want to see. So you bet I'm angry. In terms of the mechanics, the film does not quite follow the basic lines of an early song-and-dance musical. Invariably, there is a secondary subplot involving different characters who, depending on the film, build tension, contrast, or comic relief. None of that existed here, although there were some opportunities which never bore fruit. Perhaps some more false leads by the writer? I saw them as distracting dead ends.There are also a number of plot holes which are annoying, a couple of which involve cell phones and unexchanged cell phone numbers that would have happened in real life. Any musical expects people to suspend disbelief, but the suspension of disbelief is generally in the musical parts, not the narrative.Two of the best parts of the movie were the acting by the two leads-- excellent. They were also game at the singing and dancing, and clearly worked darn hard to do a great job. But to be honest, Gosling's singing (a presumed effort to mimic Astaire's approach) was not good, and Stone's dancing didn't hold a candle to a really trained, talented dancer (like the lead in the opening number). You can make musicals which have twists, like the ending in West Side Story, but they don't pretend to be homages--they make it clear, up front, they are something different. So, for ruining my Sunday afternoon, I give this movie a 1."
"A stone cold performance from Emma and the goose is cooked where Ryan is concerned. Any attempts to recreate the chemistry of so-called Hollywood golden classics it attempts to emulate are a weak fizz. Slow and contrived, the plot is weaker than a cup of tea made from a tenth dunk of the bag. An imminently forgettable score appears built around one pleasant enough motif but is bashed beyond compare. There is richness in the jazz that underpins it all but much like its syncopated rhythms, this one misses the beat. No more so than in the much hyped opening scene: I was hoping someone might get some road rage and move the story on.The critical hype is clearly written by those with their heads firmly placed in la la land."
"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I cannot understand people who are raving about this film saying it's one of best! Ever heard of Shawhsank Redmemption, LA Confidential, Godfather??? And don't get me wrong I like musicals. Mary Poppins, Sound of Music are terrific. But this?! I wanted to run out after half an hour. Whiplash was OK and far better than this nonsense. Don't waste your time. I am a jazz musician so naturally I'm critical of the music. There was nothing memorable about any of the tunes. I am also a huge Ryan Gosling fan but he was totally wasted in this part. We went to this film with a few other couples and the the best review one of us gave was that it was ""OK""."
"I've never been more disappointed in a film than I have with La La Land. The trailer had me completely sucked in and I couldn't wait to see it at the cinema. However, this film is an hour too long, had practically no story and was so boring to watch, my Mom was asleep after 10 minutes. Not just that but all the 'singers' in the film were far too weak, Gosling and Stone didn't have powerful enough voices to carry off the lead parts. John Legend had the best voice by far, but his part was so small it didn't make a difference to the film as a whole. Not good at all, if you do go to see this, don't believe all the hype and go in with low expectations.8.8 on IMDb, what a joke!"
"I went to see this movie only because of all the Oscar nominations, but when it turned out to be so cheesy that I would send it back if it was a pizza I'd ordered, I read the fan reviews, hoping somebody would explain what I had missed. None do, but I've learned something I had not wanted to know about IMDb reviews. Musicals like Annie and Grease understood that there needs to be a plot line between the songs, and some songs should be decent enough to not need a movie to sell them. Unfortunately, La La Land was only created to prove Mel Gibson's paranoia about Hollywood correct. The racist screenwriters wanted to ensure we all knew that they thought the teacher in the movie Dangerous Minds was too nice (they hammer on this twice in the movie). They then try to hide their racism behind portrayal of the main character having black friends and liking jazz, but only long enough to end the movie with a drawn out scene about this same character deciding he was wrong about those choices and regretting that he ever made any black friends. Somehow, Hollywood's elite thought this message was more important than reminding Americans about a forgotten war hero who singlehandedly saved nearly a hundred American lives on the battlefield in WWII, or the true story of an Indian boy's struggles to find his family."
"Disappointing, definitely not worth the acclaim it's getting. I love Emma Stone and Gosling though, both great actors. However, they can't sing which make it sometimes a bit painful. Also, you start with a very ""American style"" movie with all the flowers, the group singing, the happiness, the dancing and jumping. So I guess you expect a movie that is going to at least end on a positive note. Well it doesn't and I don't think that separating the 2 lovers at the end brings anything special to the movie. Either you focus on the story line and you make it interesting, moving, fun and then you can create a bit of a drama at the end. However, everything was to be expected from beginning to the end, so please give the spectator at least a bit of relief and let's them be happy together with a kid!!! It's a shame it could have been great !"
"To boot, I loved almost all the separate components of the film individually but I didn't love the resulting bundle.Aesthetically, my eyes were gently caressed with beauty for the full duration of the movie and for that I'm most appreciative.Ryan Gosling is his usual, immaculate self, succeeding in gracing us with yet another stunning performance -- stylish, suave and utterly charming.Emma Stone has her ups and middles but never a down, and she gave me one of the sole two scenes that made my breathing falter against an emotional hiccup; another win.Now, on the musical side of things...Meh.The songs left me disinterested, the overall sound dress of the film rang uninspired and repetitive, only resonating with my pathos during a couple of instances, while the rest lagged tiredly to the request of the more instinct-driven scenes.The story itself... a bit silly, no? Simplistic almost, benefiting from a strong start, a fantastic ending and the sparking chemistry between the protagonists, on the other hand, lacking any sort of actual substance past the forced demand to fall head over heels with the kitty- cuteness that we are being presented, no questions asked. I don't like having my arm twisted into feeling, and this is where this otherwise whimsical tale of sensory affluence hit another miss for me.To sum up. I acknowledge the individuality of the project, felt the strive and artistry that is so craftily weaved into the seams of this audiovisual extravaganza and I was, without a doubt, entertained. On the flip side, the way it all translated to my reason, the shortcomings of La La Land make this a middle-tier effort, only edging ahead on account of the fact that along with the glossy couple, I got to glide with effortless elegance through a Starry Night, brush shoulders with Monet, journey into the colourful and the capricious.For that fact, I will accept defeat, bump it up another star and humbly take off my fedora to it."
"I usually don't write reviews, but i felt in this case I had to. Having seen so many reviews and people raging about how wonderful this film is, I truly hate to say it, but oh how wrong they are. Firstly, as actors and people I enjoy Ryan and Emma's work, I think they are both incredibly talented and work well together. However, their styles and talents were not suitable for this movie, this was a musical-I would expect the actors to be better than sub-par singers. The dancing element, albeit abrupt and highly unnecessary in many cases, was well done, the routines were quite abstract and I enjoyed them. The story line was nothing more than predictable and in the end rather disappointing. I saw this movie with friends and the only reason why we didn't walk out was simply out of worry that one of us was enjoying it. (We weren't). There are no words I can use to recommend you to see this film - as I would be lying if I did.Please don't waste your money - It is a cross between a low budget Mama Mia, and a rather terrible Hallmark movie."
"I have an eclectic taste in films, so am not averse to a ""good"" musical - especially with impressive dance routines. West Side Story is one of my favourites, with brilliant songs, choreography and a powerful story. Mama Mia was superbly acted and sung and loads of fun. But Lala Land is so stale, dated and tacky! OK so there are some talented performers in it but the story line is shallow and trite and the music is so dated - they deserved a much better script than this! It might be considered to be a tribute to Old Style Hollywood by some but Singing in the Rain it ain't! It's not even close to that standard. I was bitterly disappointed and have no idea why it has won so many awards. I truly regret the time and money I spent going to see it!"
"Beginning with the direction of Damien Chazelle, it's clear to see why he won his Oscar, the use of the camera to draw out emotion from the smallest bit of detail just shows why he's one of the best up and coming directors around today.
The music written for this film is the best music written for a film for a very long time, maybe as far back as singing in the rain. Each song tells the story, it doesn't break the narrative, the audience can see the relevance of each song played.
This film is just magnificent and will go down as a classic, rightfully so."
"I don't get it. Some movies get really, really lucky and fortunate to get the high and rave reviews and also Oscars. I'm a musician and I couldn't stand this movie - it's only noise at the best - not much music in it.This movie is OVER-HYPED by their marketing department to make more money. Stay away from this unless you want to waste a couple of your hours that you will NEVER get back!"
"I am usually mistrustful of over-hyped movies but, on this occasion, I was in the mood for a feel good musical with an upbeat message - not something I am usually drawn to. The Sunday Times reviewer said that ""Hating La La Land is like hating a puppy"" and gave it 4 stars. Well I like puppies very much but this movie was a massive disappointment. Bad singing; bad dancing; and a mediocre script, made this movie, in my opinion one of the worst movies of the last 12 months. How this can be considered as Oscar material is beyond me but then clearly I am in a minority - although judging by many of the reviews on here - not that small a minority. The second half, in my opinion, was better than the first half. And, yes I did get most of the symbolism and the attempts at pastiche and various homages to the past. This definitely won't be on my 'best of' list."
"I'll never get those two hours back or my money! I should have read further into the reviews on here before wasting my time. This is nothing like I expected. I truly don't understand all the hype this movie has received and how it's winning so many awards. The acting & dancing is not very good and their singing leaves a lot to be desired. I've seen better singing & dancing on The Muppet Show! I thought there would be lots of visuals of LA but no, pretty much studio lot and apartment scenes. I was so disappointed!Please don't waste your time on this movie! Just go out to eat and spend your money on a good meal!"
What an awful movie. Are the rating a joke? The movie cinematography was so tight and out of balance that it was disturbing. Talking heads that themselves get cropped off from time to time. People bumping into the edge of the screen or looking off the screen. It was out of balance and dizzying as they panned between the characters.Then the story is supposed to be about love but ends up being about narcissism. Achieving maximum career success is better than true love. In the real world love is about compromise and working towards mutual success. Of course this movie is about Los Angeles and Hollywood so maybe that is the way it works there looking at the divorce rate for celebrities. But this is not the reality that exist in the other 99% of the country so I do not get the appeal of this movie.I did bump the rating to 2 because there is a good scene with John Legend singing in a night club.
"This is a film for those who like predictable and corny song and dance romance plots. I saw the high rating and, since I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I had high hopes for this flick, but . . . alas . . .I couldn't even stomach it after the first 15 or so minutes and gave up. I'm surprised I lasted that long. What a crashing bore.West Side Story or Oklahoma this ain't. I live in CA and resent the fact that this film tries to transport its inferior East Coast let's-dance-our-way-down-Broadway type schlock to our sandy shores.I honestly got the feeling that while Emma was enjoying her stint as a singing dancing out of work actress, Ryan was a complete fish out of water. Bless him for trying----I guess.There must have been a lot of theater goers who loved this film. It just goes to show that de gustibus non est disputandum. There is no accounting for taste."
"Well, I give this movie 5/10 but I give the lowest note here because I can't believe it has 8,7/10 from people. This movie is BORING. It is just a crap. It is a bad movie. The plot doesn't have any sense, the graphic/effects are POOR. Stone's smiles and eyes are ugly, but she's a decent actress. Gosling is a BAD actor, he has one smile on his face during the entire movie, a smile of a poor dog. They sing only few songs and they don't even ""sing"". Stone moans, Gosling mumbles. I can't believe it receives golden globes, I can't believe Gosling and Stone won for ""best actors"". It's pathetic.If you want to see it - please DON'T."
"La La Land is certainly the most ""hyped"" film of the year. Maybe it's a film for people who don't like musicals, or have never seen a really great musical film. As much as I like both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, neither of them can sing or dance well enough to star in a musical. It's mind boggling to think of all of the talented men and women on Broadway who could have really nailed these roles. The opening musical sequence is embarrassing. And way too long - kept looking down to avoid watching the screen. Also, much of the plot is a rehash of another crummy musical, New York, New York (1977) At least that one had Liza Minnelli to sort of save the day whenever she started singing. The ending, especially, is the same downer. It doesn't work.So catch this on a rental if you're curious, but it was not enjoyable. Will probably win all kinds of Academy Awards, knowing Hollywood - it's that bad."
"I really wanted to like this movie... It had so much potential but it's a lack of everything it wanted to be... First, I like both actors, I really do..But I don't think they did justice to dancing or singing.It simply didn't look real or serious enough.Either they're not talented enough or they should've work harder and longer for it...I'm not a professional dancer but you can see from the sky that the way they move their feet isn't real dancers alike! Idea of bringing old Hollywood style, step dancing and singing is brilliant but there is no much story..Scenario is somehow cheap.John Legend I love your music..But casting him was more desperate than necessary..The buzz over this movie is just so over-hyped, they're even mentioning Oscar nominations which it obviously doesn't deserve..You simply can't put this next to Titanic,The Lord of the rings or I don't know... Brave Heart or Gladiator category...It takes a better story.It needs to be more original,more breathtaking..It needs to to give you goosebumps and be something to remember! There isn't much to tell about this movie,cause even tho it wanted , this movie simply doesn't give enough! I'm sorry but it's six from me!"
"Sorry, I had to give it a 1 to counter the people who gave this a 10.My wife and I went to see this movie based on ratings. It isn't really a very good anything. It had no memorable songs. It didn't have any singers to mention. Sorry, the main actors are not singers.The drama part may have been the best where we find that following your dream takes away from REAL people and real relationships so in that way it was sad, so sad.Calling this a comedy is wrong. Only once in the theater did I hear others laughing and that was only for a brief moment. Maybe is was the kind of people in the audience. My wife and I were talking about where is PeeWee Herman and the two guys in front of us told us to shush during where Ryan was whistling on the pier. Really? Did we take away from the whistle sound track that much guys? Don't think I missed the two times the piano was not played correctly either. However one of the grand's was nicely tuned. That may have been the best part of the movie. You got to hear the difference between a real piano and an electronic one. The real is always better as is real relationships are always better than following your own desires."
"I went in expecting something wonderful like Chicago, or Moulin Rouge, but instead was treated to mediocre at best. The acting was good, the sound was OK, but there was nothing ""best"" about it. I don't know how it was able to garner ANY Oscar nominations. There just wasn't anything Oscar worthy about it. It was trying to had to hearken back to the days of Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers and failed miserably. The singing wasn't that great either. I like both of the star actors, but this just wasn't the right vehicle for them. Their singing was just OK. The songs were nothing memorable that I would want the sound track for. The only really good song was the one sung by John Legend. The City of Stars was a nice little ditty, but that about it. The whole movie from beginning to end was just underwhelming. Both my partner and I felt the same way walking out. In fact, his first words were, ""Well that's four hours we'll never get back."" I said, ""It was only two hours."" He said, ""EXACTLY."" Oh well, I guess you can't like everything."
"I have to be honest and admit that musical is not my favorite type of movie but after all this good reviews and recommendation and all nominations for Oscars I decided to watch it yesterday. Calling myself a movie fan I just had to see it to be able to say what I think. Oh ....I don't even know where to start- I am so disappointed. I do like the actors- Ryan Gosling is great and Emma Stone is not bad also but that is the only positive in that film. Such a boring, long and usual story- nothing new, nothing surprising. Total fail in my eyes. I don't understand why people are so impressed by it. And why or why we are going like backwards - why suddenly we like old fashion type of cinema??? That is mystery for me... I am a woman so I do like good romance but even that was not the best I've seen. Have not much to say except- I seen it, it's done, will never watch it again- very forgettable average movie. Shame...."
"Saw La La Land a week ago and I needed time to process how little impressed with it I ended up being. It is a sparkly superwhite depiction of LA in an utterly apolitical, hipster way that scratches it's soles to the beat of eras when most things were just that - self-centered posh people having ""dreams."" It is, underneath the personal story of two people trying to ""be something"", an embodiment of ""make film great again"" as the dictator down south's mean-spirited and ignorant slogan about America itself is. It is a throwaway film, most certainly does NOT deserve any Oscars, and is actually quite forgettable, except for the City of Stars song. The dancing isn't just off, it's terrible, dare I say, utterly lame. Emma Stone's charm only got me so far through this puffed up piece of cupcake dust. The use of Griffith Observatory becomes goofier than even the worst parts of Titanic. Arrival, Moonlight, even Manchester by the Sea are far, far superior films. This of course means La La Land will win big time. I enjoyed Warcraft more. Seriously."
"So first of all, if there weren't this much marketing about the movie, if the movie hadn't won 6 Oscars and if people around me didn't think so high of it, I would have been fair and given La La Land a 3 or a 4. But when raising expectations this much, it is just impossible to give a better grade than 1!The movie is one of the most boring I've seen in the past years. the first scene is sooo embarrassing I was so close to leave the theatre. I should have. The story line is flat. It can be summarized in two lines.La la land is cheesy and unlyrical. If you want to produce a musical, teach your actors how to dance. I mean an average dancer could probably do better.The cinematography is supposed to be wow, but to my eye they completely overuse the use of colours. For me a good mise en place in a good movie is the one that your eyes like without you realizing which elements make it this way until you stare for a moment. La La land was too obvious to me. The use of widescreen is hollow. The whole thing is gimmickry.While adding an old Hollywood look to a modern day movie is original, it just isn't my thing. What's the purpose? to connect to the old musicals? he wishes...Also a small detail, why the hell is Mia's dressing so ugly?????"
"I went to watch this movie as its getting lot of praise all around. But, I found it just an OK film. In fact, there were times, I was looking over my watch when will this movie get over!! Ryan Gosling is attractive, charming.. but in some scenes, he gets expressionless..Emma looks just average. Her acting is way better than Ryan Gosling.However, movie is colorful, musical background track is also good. Music is superb but I expected a bit more on the story part. Overall, I could not connect with this movie. Really think that I wasted my 2 hours and money on this movie."
"This is simply the worst 'musical' I have ever seen. It was clear to my wife and I, about 30 minutes into this, that the actors, director and composer where too young to remember, or too young to understand the old musicals, and just how much talent went into those productions.The music was dreary and unmemorable, the story was uneven and made little sense. I think Emma Stone is a delightful actress, but this was a huge overreach for her. Ryan Gosling was stiff and bland (as he is most of the time).My advice to people who gave this a 10, please go watch:SINGIN' IN THE RAIN -- WEST SIDE STORY -- THE WIZARD OF OZ -- THE SOUND OF MUSIC -- CABARET -- MARY POPPINS -- A STAR IS BORN -- MY FAIR LADY -- AN American IN Paris -- MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS -- ON THE TOWN -- THE BAND WAGONStart with that line up - then come back and watch this rubbish, and see if its still 10 stars."
"I saw this movie because of all the Oscar hype (how can a movie have more Oscar nominations than The Godfather?). I read the negative reviews and wanted to make up my own mind. The negative reviewers were absolutely right. In time, movie reviewers will look back on this movie as a 2017 aberration and wonder- what were they thinking? Did someone put something in the water? The plot is juvenile, cliché Hollywood struggles, about making it 'big'. Grow up! The plot reinforces racial stereotypes about the white guy being the purist and the black guys work for him. What the! The main characters can't sing or dance (I had to stop myself from laughing- what an insult to the greatness of past musical performers) Needs extensive editing. So many unnecessary long pensive moments. Filler shots. The special effects were so lame. (Eg you could see Emma Stones harness bulking up her waistline). Couldn't make out the lyrics in the jumbled mess of the opening number. Contrived pause to allow the audience to applaud. Unrealistic coy behaviour of the two leads as they fall in love- what the! (Are they tweennies? Is this set in current times or not?). Throughly, absolutely, forgettable."
"We should give credit when it's due, but not when it doesn't deserve it. Damien Chazelle did an excellent job in writing and directing the movie Whiplash in 2014, but not so with La La Land in 2016.This latest film was utter garbage and deserves less than a 1/10. It wasn't only painful for me to watch, but I also was robbed of my precious time and energy, because of the media's thumbs up reviews, which should have been all thumbs down.Although the actors where good, the ""chemistry"" was awkward and boring.The story line was a C- poor. It needed much more substance and quality.I will never trust movie reviews ever again. How this got so many nominations blows mind! This proves to me that Hollywood is truly corrupt and filled with favoritism. There are way too many movies better than this that did not get nominated.Shame on you Hollywood. Shame on you movie reviewers who lied about this being great. I felt like I was stabbed in the back multiple times by watching this crap and the lies that are trying to keep this movie afloat.Don't give into to the hype. This movie is just not right."
"I've read 8 great reviews on this film. I went and saw the movie last night, and I'm usually a very positive person, but was very disappointed. The highly ranked reviews must be from Sunshine Pumpers who are desperate for a comeback of a 1940's musical, or don't have a clue about a great musical:(""Chicago"", ""West Side Story"", ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Grease"", ""Singing in the Rain"", ""Cabaret"", ""Oklahoma"", ""King and I"" etc. etc. etc.) None of the songs were catchy or memorable. The good: Emma Stone did some very good acting. Also the sets were creative, and colorful. Miscast: Ryan Gosling, he can't sing. (think of a 25 year old stoic Kevin Costner) He would have been better type cast in a sports, western, buddy movie, mystery, gangster, or in a drama. Most likely cast as eye candy for the 18 to 24 year old gals. The opening scene is a hot, sweaty LA traffic jam on the freeway, where 50 or more people jump out of their cars, and start dancing and singing. It's a long non-stop shot that is VERY difficult to film. (think of Orson Welles: ""Touch of Evil"") but we have all been there, no fun, brought back bad memories of heavy traffic jams, and I just couldn't see the fun in a traffic jam. It's like I wouldn't want to see a song and dance scene of a ER room or of Anne Frank. No memorable classic lines: ('Show Me the Money"", ""You'll Shoot Your Eye Out Kid"", ""There's No Crying in Baseball"". Folks, this film will be forgotten in a year. Don't expect the next coming of ""The Sound of Music"". This is a poor man's Woody Allen movie!"
"I struggled to keep awake during the movie - and that is not how a good film is supposed to be. La La Land was not atrocious but I'm giving it 1 star because it was the first film ever that made me regret spending time and money on. If it weren't for all the hype I might've given it 4.Was there a point in making this film? There is nothing special La La Land is trying to convey, the acting is bland, the songs are dull, the storyline is overused and predictable, all in all it is a film of clichés. I seriously cannot believe this won so many awards - should I be worried about the future of film or am I missing an important point?"
"...and i wish i did the same.This was nothing. A movie designed to please the academy awards committee in a self glorifying tribute to themselves. A remembrance to the movies they used to make (and watch) in ""the good ol days"".. By Hollywood, for Hollywood.There was no story. I was waiting for the movie to start. I wanted to leave SO bad, but i didn't want to ruin the experience for the other people i went to the Cinema with...turns out they were all doing the same thing. And when we left the the cinema, i heard people saying it's the most boring piece of crap they had seen in a long while. I'm not a buffoon, honestly, i like a good musical. I grew up watching Fred Astaire movies with my grandma. This was not that. This movie is living on a hype. Don't buy in to it. Oh and if you kinda went ""oh...ehm...wtf?"" in the flying scene, you're not alone."
"I like movie musicals, like 'West Side Story', 'Mamma Mia' or even 'Mary Poppins', so I was really looking forward to seeing this movie - especially after the great opening on the highway. Unfortunately, my expectations were disappointed. Just because everyone says that the movie is great, it doesn't mean it is.First of all, the plot is not very interesting. Mia (Emma Stone) works in a coffee shop but wants to become an actress. She falls in love with jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) whom she meets roughly 10 times ""by chance"". Sebastian tries to save jazz and convinces Mia that jazz is the best music in the world. At the end, Mia gives up her dream while Sebastian creates a successful jazz club. Since there is so little action, much of the time there's boring conversation and a lot of clichés. At the end a different, shortened version of the movie is presented where the protagonists are always successful. It was so hard to watch it to the end.Second, the singing and dancing was mediocre. Emma stone performed better than Ryan Gosling, but that isn't hard. None of them are professional singers or dancers.Third, there's the music. Google says there are 28 songs, but some of the themes are used in very many different songs. Maybe I would have been overwhelmed by the music if it wasn't that repetitive. But 'City of Stars' or 'Mia and Sebastian's theme' were played so often that I was really annoyed when I had to hear it the fifth time.All in all, I can't recommend this movie. If you are a jazz lover, there are some music scenes that might interest you, but you can also watch them on Youtube."
"It was such a below average movie. One thing expected of a musical is great music, music that you come out humming, but it could not give me one. There are only occasional pieces of piano and Jazz which were nice.The opening score was so long and horrible.I really hated the motion-blur effect in the movie. The characters were the typical LA artists, struggling. There was nothing to the characters, no complexity with the characters, no complexity in the relationships between characters. Ryan Gosling was a really bad singer. It was too long for the content, I kept watching my phone to know the time. Almost slept during the movie."
"Emma stone has been noted from a number of strong performances, she really does try to make the best out of a shallow one dimensional character. But this is doomed to fall flat on it's deflated face with the unbelievable, unremarkable performance from Ryan Gosling. There's visuals to take your breath away, costume and set design that take you on a cinematic journey into Hollywood. Apart from all of the gloss, there's nothing left but a plain storyline with half developed characters that seems to be working aimlessly through a cliché plot. The on screen chemistry is what struck me as missing at first but then you realise this is largely due to a flat dynamic between characters. How do they truly feel? What do they truly love about one another? Why couldn't they work it out? It's not in there. & We can't guess, because we don't KNOW them. By the end they're as much strangers as they are to us in the beginning. Much like a roller coaster that accelerates to the top only to slowly descend and safely pop us back to 0.It's overrated, boring and sad because there was great potential for a cutting edge take on an old comforting theme. Instead we are on oooh! then oh?"
