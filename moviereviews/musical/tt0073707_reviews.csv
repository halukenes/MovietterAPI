"This movie is just one of the best Hindi movie i have seen. Its one of my favorite film. It has all the elements that a good Hindi movie must have.
The settings of the hilly mountainous village, the dusty n tough terrain, the train sequence n the villain Gabbar played menacingly by Amjad Khan, were all awesome. Such is the impact of the villains acting is that u always remember him by his character's name frm the movie. One of the movies you remember for life.
Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra were awesome too. The character of Hema malini was cheesy n unbelieavable though. A woman riding a horse chariot that too in the cow belt area wher rape is rampant. Nevertheles the film is solid entertainment. 
It is a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven with shades of Once uopn a time in the west.
A true cinematic masterpiece."
"No film before or after Sholay has achieved as much - running to full houses in an unbroken 6 year stretch! Consider the fact that this happened in India - where the audiences have the most choices amongst all the people of the world. Consider the fact that no movie anywhere in the world has been able to reap even half this success that Sholay enjoys.It is potent, does not pretend, and has clearly been made with courage and conviction. It was made for the enjoyment of its predominantly Indian, fun-loving audiences, so my dear detractors from the clan of the perennially cynical, reality-fed, fun deprived masses of the world, kindly excuse yourselves. Sholay is quintessential Mumbai produce - you either consume and enjoy in total acceptance, or you're not fit for the ride. It is as simple as that.The world would be a poorer place without films like Sholay, not only because of the almost arrogant instantaneous and total suspension of disbelief it demands from its audiences, but because of the honesty and sheer power of that demand. You go to a boxing match to see two boxers fight it out, not to see them playing chess in the middle of the ring!Sholay will always be an incredible and shining example of purity, because it was the purest attempt made to entertain, with absolutely no quarters even considered for critical acclaim from the so called pundits of cinema.Yours truly is guilty of seeing this film 23 times to date, 17 of these in the theatres. And if opportunity allows, I wouldn't mind being sentenced to death with more of this guilt delightfully added to my conscience.As with any other film, there have been many comments on what is wrong with Sholay. To these, here is my personal quote - ""A good film is about getting most things right, not about getting the fewest things wrong!""And here is my response to other heartless comments on Sholay being a copy of some other film or filmmaker's work - ""If every human was an original, we would have 6 billion different species without a single one to call friend or family"".To argue against failure may be human, but to argue against success is sub-human. You may limit yourselves if you so wish."
"If you liked ""Once upon a time in the west"", ""The magnificent seven"" and ""A fistful of dollars"", you will love ""Sholay"". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest ""curry"" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the ""spaghetti"" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after. A masterpiece."
"This movie is just the best movie i have seen. (I have watched around 570 movies) (Its my favorite movie).It has all the elements that a good movie must have:Excellent Dialogues.Excellent Music.Excellent Acting. (Even the extra's where excellent)Excellent Story/Plot.Good Songs.And it has much genres, who are handled very well in this movie: Action/Comedy/Romance/Drama/Adventure/Thriller (not really, but a kind of Thriller)/Musical/Crime. Each word of this movie is excellent. I think it has the greatest story ever! I was hurted when i came to know that Mr. Ram Gopal Varma is remaking this classic... Despite becoming the most successful film of its time, it failed to win any major popular or critics awards. The lone Filmfare award it got went to M.S. Shinde for Best editing. The plot is about a retired police officer Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) who hires two convicts Veeru and Jai (Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan) to capture Gabbar Singh (a Dacoit) who had killed the cop's entire family (except the cop and his daughter-in-law).Who has not seen this movie, try it once, you will love it. *****"
"Great Movie... Everyone should have seen this movie at least one time ! I bought this movie on DVD now, although I am not a big fan of elder films... i love this film, and especially the dialogs of GB ! For all Amitabh fans its a must have movie ! The whole story is really good and the movie has a flair of an American western. Even the sound of Sholay and the atmosphere which is given to the watcher are one of the best i have seen in Bollywood. I have heard, there will be a remake of this film, but I think it could not be as good as the original Sholay. All because of the actors like Amjad Khan who was born for this role. This film is one of bollywood's best movies ever."
Can't find a single flaw in the movie. Probably one of the best ever made in Hindi. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. The music is memorable. One of the movies you remember for life.
"This movie has everything, comedy, action, drama, romance, fun, emotions. Great performance by all the characters. They are remembered even today in 2004 after nearly 30 years of the film release. I heard that this movie is now re-released with remastered sound. wow ! cant' wait to fetch the DVD of this remastered version.The most impressive role of Gabbar by Amjad Khan was portrayed extremely well. Its also one the longest movie. Its quite normal for bollywood movies to be 3 hours long. But this one is even longer than this. But certainly ever minute of the movie is enjoyable.This movie is my all time favorite."
"As a strong fan of the American Western genre and of course the directing of Sergio Leone, it is with great enthusiasm that i recommend Sholay to any audiences or fans of Westerns and Bollywood cinema.Perhaps, the greatest film in the history of Bollywood cinema (with one of the longest theatrical runs in Bollywood history), this is the definitive Bollywood action epic movie in the same way that Leone's 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' was the definitive Western.The film features the acting talents of such Bollywood legends...Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra and focuses at its heart, a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven.If you have not watched it, then make it your priority to watch it at least once in your life, as this is definitely one of the movies that every person needs to experience.A true cinematic masterpiece."
"""Kitne Aadmi Thei"", every Indian film fan knows this dialog by heart. Sholay was released in 1975, also the year I was born in, coincidence, perhaps. The film became the longest running Indian film in the theaters, a record that stood for over 25 years until it was broken recently by another classic ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (holds the current record 500 Weeks and still going - as on May 07, 2005).Sholay was written by the great Duo of Javed Akhtar and Salim Khan know as Salim-Javed. The duo also gave us films like Don, Shakti, Shaan, Zanjeer, Seeta Aur Geeta and Deewar. The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy and had music of legendary R.D. Burman. Sholay gave us a Character called ""Gabbar Singh"" played by Amjad Khan, who made his debut with this film. The character of Gabbar Singh is so creative that many film makers have tried to imitate him for their films.Sholay did for Indian Cinema what Casablanca did for Hollywood. It became an instant classic and broke all the rules of film making and characterization, while preserving the values of Indian cinema.Sholay just won the Filmfare Award (2005) for being the Best Film in the last 50 years of Indian Cinema. Sadly, when Sholay was first released in 1975 it didn't win any major Filmfare awards. But when you think about all the great films that were released in that year, its easy to see how it may have been over looked. 1975 may have been the best year for Hindi films with the likes of Deewar, Chupke Chupke, Hera Pheri, Khel Khel Mein, Julie, Mausam, Ponga Pandit, Rafoo Chakkar, Uljhan, Dharmatma, Do Jasoos, Faraar, Geet Gaata Chal, Chhoti Si Baat, Aandhi and Milli - all releasing along with Sholay.Sholay had the biggest star cast of its time with the likes of Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri, Sanjeev Kumar, Sachin, A.K. Hangal, Leela Mishra, Satyen Kappu, Mac Mohan, Jagdeep, Asrani, Helen, Jalal Agha, Iftekhar, Keshto Mukherjee and of course Amjad Khan. The Greatest Cast Ever Assembled for the Greatest Story Ever Told!"
"I am shocked seeing that the IMDb ratings for this classic is just 6.6. Why? Because the movie is strongly influenced from the Westerns? or It it isn't entertaining enough?The 2nd cant be true because the movie had everything: strong script strong direction excellent characters and performances good action,comedy,romance,friendship,etcIf the 1st is true then i feel sorry for the viewers because being influenced is not being copied.Besides there would remain only like 50-60 original scripts if counted correctly.I cannot find a single flaw in the movie which is my personal thinking and as it would be of true Hindi cinema fans.So people please judge the movie on its merits and not on something which is totally baseless.RATING:- *****/*****"
This is one movie which is flawless. Great performances from everyone. The cast of the movie is just perfect. Gabbar's character remains indelibly etched on your mind once you've seen him in action. Amitabh is definitely one of the greatest actors of all times. His portrayal of a criminal with morals is all the way tops along with Brando's Vito Corleone. I think the part about cheating with false coin to save Viru's life (sacrificing his own) was a lovely storyteller's touch. 10 all the way!
"Everybody knows this is the Best Bollywood film ever made. I am surprised that this films rating in IMDb is not 10 /10 that it deserves. If you ask any Bollywood genius about this movie, they will tell you its the Best film of all time. Its no. 1 in the top 100 Best Bollywood Movies Stardust magazine. This movie had all the elements to make a great movie. Great Acting, Great Dialouges, Great music, Violence, comedy, Romance, Emotions and Relationships (Friendship). It stars Bollywood's Greatest ever actor Amitabh Bchchan in a Powerhouse performance. Dharmendra in his Best film that I've seen. Hema Malini is fantastic as the in famous fast talking Basanti. Jaya Bachchan is superb as the quiet widow. Amjad Khan steals the show as the legendary famous Villain Gabbar Singh. The other cast have done a decent job. This is the Greates Film Bollywood have released. Fullstop."
"Best 10 MoviesPather Panchali, Bandini, Saaransh, Shole, Shakti, Anand, Awaara, Satya, Golmaal, Hera-Pheri.and 11th Shwas (Marathi Movie!)Basically, whether a person likes a movie or not is subjective. Still, there are certain guidelines to rate a movie. The subject of the movie (Pather Panchali, Bandini, Saaransh), the way it is presented (Awaara), production quality (that is why I discarded Andaaz apana apana), camera angles (Shole is best in this section but satya, aawaara are great too!), the dramatization of the subject (Shakti, Anand) are some of the elements that makes a movie great. Comedy is one of the hardest skill to acquire and perform. That is why I included Golmaal and Hera-Pheri. The seemingly easy subject are presented in such a hilarious ways that these movies definitely deserve accolades. Shwas is my personal favourite. It is a Marathi movie. And the story is about a grandfather and his 6 years old grandson, who is about to loose his eyesight due to rare cancer."
"One thing that strikes most about this movie is the characterization. Millions of people still remember the characters in this movie. The plot is inspired from ""Seven Samurai"" but it is adapted well to the Indian backdrop. This movie was made at a time when bandits were not an extinct species. The plot is simple, Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) is a cop who arrests a notorious bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) only to gain his wrath. The bandit escapes and massacres Thakur's family and severs both his arms. Thakur hires two men, Veeru and Jay (played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan) to capture Gabbar.All the characters of this movie have left a mark on Indian cinema for a long time and will continue to remain so. Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Jaya Bachchan and Hema Malini are all brilliant in the movie. But one man steals the show as the villain who is cunning, merciless and evil. Gabbar Singh's character was played by Amjad Khan and he is fantastic in the film. It is because of him that the movie became the greatest Indian film ever !! 10/10"
"This is the greatest Indian movie ever made. Each dialogue, each scene, each song, each character is immortal. I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it does not fail to evoke deep emotions every time. From the very first train sequence, Gabbar Singh's entry, a father's plight after discovering his son's dead body and the final clash between good and evil, this movie is masterful story telling. Although Zanjeer created the angry young man image for Amitabh, this movie surely set him on the path to super stardom. This movie was so good that even Ramesh Sippy, the direcor, has since not been able to create a movie to match this one."
"this was, is and will be the epitome of movies made in Hindi. the total package was as complete as any movie can come in. soundtrack by R.D.Burman is one of the finest ever made in any cinema. the movie is based on the life of a police officer whose family is brutally murdered by a dacoit whom he had captures early in his career.wounded in the fight , he hires two small-time crooks to help him get his revenge.the cinematography, direction, sets, location, and above all the extraordinary performances by each and every actor in the movie makes it a visual and mental treat. a tight storyline, with just the right flow in the script. whew!!! the more i say the less it sounds. see it to believe it."
"Absolutely phenomenal success. Nearly 70% of Indian population has seen the movie at least once. If were to count people having seen more than once, number of hours watched of this movie crosses 14 billion hours!! Currency converted value, it has garnered nearly 150 million USD, plus equal amount is black market. All needed now is to have superb sound in 3D Surround, and this movie will fetch another 500 million USD, as Bollywood is getting much needed exposure to global consumers. I am very sure this movie will remain most watched movie in the cinema world for ever, as its charm has not vanished, at least in South Asian viewers."
"Well, this movie speaks for itself. 'Sholay' is the quintessence of a very popular genre in Bollywood - ""Crime+Drama"". Acting, Dialogues and Cinematography is impeccable. Regarding the plot - its novelty, people may argue that its a mixture of many Hollywood movies (of 'western' genre). I have seen most of those movies which are claimed to be the 'archetype' of this classic. It surely carries the hints of them but you should know that - ""to steal ideas from one source is 'plagiarism' but to steal from multiple sources is what is known as 'research' (no offense to researchers !)"". The Sholay crew did their groundwork and research and delivered a true MASTERPIECE.10/10"
"Often overrated or seen-too-much by so-called ""film critics"" and 'bollywood' viewers, THIS MOVIE IS NOT A MASTERPIECE!!! why? first of all Darmendra overacts in most parts of the film. I have seen many scenes of this film taken from 'The good, the bad and the ugly' in 1966. When they can't do anything original, don't even copy then!! what they do is add some few songs to the film to make it longer, add an actress or dancer who will dance and entertain the bollywood viewers who become greatly impressed by the copied actions and scenes in the film. Bollywood viewers need to watch more and more variety films to know what is really going on here and not just clapping their hands to something that is not worth so much reputation and glamour. The director and producer of this film boast so much about something they have copied and even get great awards for this plagiarism. To whom should the credit really go? WATCH THE FILM I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE FOR FURTHER DETAILS YOU WILL EXPERIENCE YOURSELVES."
a landmark movie and one of the best.i give it 10 out of 10.i also want to say that this movie is not a remake and the plot is original. and any American who says that it is a remake then he is rude and a dirty liar because it is just inspired by other western movies and this movie is an Indian western that is much better than any American western because the Indian actors and actresses have true and warm emotions that the American actors and actresses don't have. it was directed with an unmatched excellence.i recommend it very much to everyone.it is such a wonderful movie.a true masterpiece.
"I have yet to come across anyone who has disliked this film; even people I know who dislike Indian films admit that Sholay is a truly great film. The reason is quite simple....the genres covered are universal, and the acting and direction is quite phenomenal. The characters are so brilliantly portrayed that one can sense their emotions within oneself. It has long been argued about who is the best actor in the film. Well for me, it is impossible to tell. Amjad Khan plays Gabbar Singh magnificently, but then again you have Amitabh as Jai, Dharmendra as Veeru, Hema Malini as Basanti and Sanjeev Kumar as Thakur Baldev Singh, all of who put in immaculate performances. How can one choose between them? To 'put the icing on the cake', Sholay also contains two of the greatest songs in Bollywood history(yeh dostee and jub koyee haseena root jaatee hai). When I first watched this film as a child, I was almost crying at the end. Even now when I watch it I find myself getting emotional. Yet there are parts in this film that make you laugh hysterically. So no matter what kind of films you like, this is definitely one to watch....it really is one of the truly great films ever made."
"***SOME SPOILERS***** Sholay, directed by Ramesh Sippy in 1975, remains the most successful Hindi (perhaps Indian) film ever made. While a couple of films have made more money and recently Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge surpassed Sholay's unprecedented 5 year run at Minerva Theatre in Bombay, Sholay leads by dint of the sheer impact it made on not just Indian cinema, but popular culture in general. The film is a loose adaptation of the Magnificent Seven (itself based on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai) and borrows freely from other movies - Hollywood or Indian. However, its adaptation is uniquely Indian and it remains, to my mind, immeasurably superior to the movies it is based upon. The story is about two crooks, Jai and Veeru, in rural central India - a region ravaged by dacoits (outlaws) - who are hired by a village landlord, Thakur to catch Gabbar Singh- a notorious outlaw - alive. Jai is the quiet reflective crook, while Veeru is loud, boisterous, impetuous, and a lothario to boot. Veeru falls in love with Basanti - a garrulous taangewali (horsecart driver) while Jai silently wooes the Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law, Radha. ******SPOILER ALERT*****SKIP THIS SECTION IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIEIt appears that Gabbar had been arrested by the Thakur while the latter was a police inspector and had exacted revenge upon escaping jail by massacring the Thakur's family. The Thakur's attempt at evening scores was met by capture and by the chopping off of his arms in a chilling scene. Hence, the need for mercenaries.****SPOILER OVER****Getting the bandit and the eventual shootout is the climax of the film, but it is greater than the sum of its parts. Each character, including minor ones like the jailer, the braggart lumber merchant (Surma Bhopali), the Maulvi, the family servant, have been well fleshed out and have significant parts - at the very least they entertain. The script tends to meander, but Sholay was not meant to be a simple revenge film - it conveyed a larger picture of villages, the dacoit menace so real then and even now.The film was shot in South India at Ramnagram rather than at the place where it was set (central India) but the stark, rugged scenery was worth it. As the first 70mm film in India and the first to use stereophonic sound, Sholay secured a place in Indian film history.Its success derives from a good script which does not allow for a dull moment (full marks to Salim-Javed for doing this), excellent direction and editing and excellent cinematography.While the film was fairly violent it was characteristic of its period. Its legacy however, is the dialogues of the major characters which the producers were able to sell as a separate LP record in 1975 - a first in Indian cinema. A generation later, most Indians who know Hindi understand ""Kitne Aadmi the?"" ""Loha Lohe ko Kat taa hai"" ""Tera Kyaa Hoga Kaalia"" - so much so that these dialogues have entered the lexicon and are frequently used in commercials.RD Burman's music was a big plus with a fantastic score and even better background music. Indeed the background music from the faux ""Western"" theme music to music that announced major characters like Gabbar Singh is recognized even after three decades.Sholay made the career of Gabbar Singh as the first psychopath on the big screen ( though some might argue that Danny Denzongpa had essayed that in Dhund) in India, though he could never get a comparable role later. Sanjeev Kumar's controlled rage as the Thakur was a close second performance. Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan were very good with both exhibiting comedy especially in the water tank scene, though Hema Malini was a bit over the top. The supporting cast of Asrani (jailor), Surma Bhopali (Lumber merchant) and others were very good.A must see that seems to transcend time. I am obviously biased but years of screening this film for international as well as Indian audiences have convinced me of its worldwide appeal."
"This movie has everything. Awesome action, wit and humour in the dialogues, the greatest hero of indian cinema, the greatest villain of all times. It captured the imagination of every movie goer and even today mothers discipline their children by telling them about gabbar singh.."
"Undoubtedly, this mega movie is a milestone in the Bollywood filmography. The film has good characterization of vengeful roles, brilliant portrayal of tragic and terrifying sequences, as well captivating cinematography reminiscent of Hollywood western movies.This was the Indian motion picture which set the stage for a different type of movies, that is to say, action movies with vital ingredients of violence, not yet crafted by Indian producers/directors and unknown among the local audience.The full and befitting advantage of this sort/dimension of Indian cinema went to Amitabh Bachan (the Fighter/Angry Hero)and the inevitable looser was the then Super Star - romantic Rajesh Khanna who was very much unable to fit into or appropriately perform angry, violent and action studded sequences that happened to be the cry of those days.All said, the Indian Cinema moved from moral based drama to western styled Hollywood movies that was not the quintessential forte of Indian polity. You can say that the cinematic imagination transformed from the sublime to the crazy and temporal.Sholay is a very interesting movie directed by the same man who had just a couple of years ago directed Andaz - a very different family movie based on real-to-life social drama. All credits to Ramesh Sippy -the Trendsetter."
"An outstanding creation, the movie made in 1975 has a timeless feel to it. one can watch it any day and still relate to it. each and every depiction in the movie is appropriate. it depicted the extremes of human emotions of the protagonist and antagonist, village life, its superstitions, the simple joys and sorrows of life. the pace of movie is fantastic. the dialogues are most apt for the situations and i wonder if there was any better dialogue possible for those characters. The cult status which has been attained by this movie is likely to make life difficult for someone who wishes to make a remake of this movie. comparisons are going to be very strong and purists would deal with a substandard replication very severely. This movie is the white demonstration of film making, a bouquet of excellent performances in acting and technical departments where the impact of the film is far greater than sum of impact of all departments. A case study for management students."
"The Best Star Cast.. The Best Background Music.. Best Direction... Best Script... Best Photography... Best Location... Best Performances... Best Debut of a Villain... Best Action...The Movie Has Action, Comedy, Drama, Tragedy and everything else which together combine to form the best commercial Indian film ever made for mass consumption..."
"Excellent characterization, acting, scripting, directing, and cinematography all put together in this film brings out the best film ever made in India.The film story line is very simple, yet very interesting to watch. Acting and dialogs in this film hold a very high caliber according to various film aficionado's. The film is about two young men hired to stop a group of bandits in a small village.I especially recommend every film student to watch this film at least twice in order to grasp the tradition of quality film-making. ""Sholay"" has a winning formula which is rare to find in todays film-making.Watch it! SCORE: 10/10"
"if you ever want 2 watch an hindi movie it must be ""sholay"", you cant go wrong with thid movie it has comedy, romance, tragedy, action,western and it is musical aswell. it has one of the best bollywood heros which is BIG B and it has a good villian, amjad khan, (decaesed). once  you have seen this film you will want to watch it again. It is about two brave theives who are best freinds  (big b and dharmendrah) who get arrested by a policeman (sanjeev kumar). some bandits attack them , the two theives risked their own lives to save the policeman. many years later he needs the help of the two theives to capture a bandit."
"This movie needs no introduction. This stands as the largest all-time grosser of Bollywood. Considering the fact that in that same year 1975 , there were several other movies that became hits later on and this movie faced a lot of competition from these movies. This is a 'multi-starrer', a trend in those days.Many dialogs in this movie became very popular in every home in India and this movie itself became a household word. Every major star in this movie has done an excellent job. The direction is very good , the photography flawless. The background music score is very apt, though it resembles the spaghetti western score.But in my opinion this movie only deserves 7 stars for the mere fact that this movie is a plagiarized though Indianized version of The Kurosawa's Japanese classic "" The Seven Samurai"". The above is a well known fact but what is little known is the trivia that this movie also borrowed a lot of its powerful ingredients from the Gary Cooper's classic ""High Noon"". Another tit bit is that the movie ""Mera Gaon Mera Desh"" that was released a few years before was another inspiration for this movie Sholay. Though the movie ""Mera Gaon Mera Desh"" has taken after ""High Noon"" to a greater degree. Also, many scenes in this movie are influenced by the spaghetti western style of movie making.But all said and done a great movie and as they say it in Hindi ""Paisa Vasool"".. certainly worth watching at least once."
"Lets talk about Sholay! The moment Sholay is mentioned, honestly the first thing comes into our mind is the ""Gabbar Singh"" with his popular dialog which is remembered until today. I would like to recommend that Sholay was a big hit just because of Gabbar Singh character. There are thousands of movie had been made and non has the Gabbar Singh villain type of quality in it. Fair enough, each character was good in the movie, but i will still stand for the Gabbar character which was wonderfully acted by late Amjad Khan. If the character were to act by some other famous villain of that time, its possible that the film have will some credits definitely, but not as what it achieved by taking Amjad Khan.Secondly, the character of Thakur Baldev Singh was the second reason's of the success. The other characters of the film has also contributed to the success of the film. The pair of Jay and Veeru was truly spirits of DOSTI. Basanti was just marvelous. Jaya was good and also Satyen Kapuu. Asrani and Jagdeep was real humorous.Their jokes are remembered until today. The Imaam Saab and the Azan scenes, touches millions hearts.The ever fear introduction of Gabbar Singh with the thrilling back ground music are the best entry of a villain ever seen of any Hindi movie.The song Yeh Dosti, Ha Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Mehbooba Mehbooba are the most popular song of the movie. RD.Burman gives great music to the film. Kader Khan - best dialog, Salim Javed - best story and script, Veeru Dev Gun - best action, Ramesh Sippy - Best Direction and all those who was involved in the film has done a very good job ever.Sad that the film was not awarded even millions have watched the film over and over again. It was blockbuster during it time and well remain ever-green movie!Finally, a complete, good and best film ever made and its impossible that there will be any other film which will be able to over take G.P Sippy SHOLAY from the main chart. Never!A film that should not been miss and worth watching. ""Aur Film Kab Hain? Kab Hain?................. Syaabas!!!"""
"TIt is a landmark film being the first ever 7o m.m film.made in India.Adapting a Western film theme to Indian Conditions is a remarkable achievement and the gun -weilding action scenes remind One of the Sergi Leone Spaghetti Westerns like 'A Few Dollars More"".The Cinematography is classical.What demarcates this film from an average one is the classical direction. The way scenes showing the Thakur's arms being amputated by Gabbar,the Thakur's grandson being shot by Gabbar and Ahmed ,the village boy being tortured to death are effectively cut reveal this aspect.The way Gabbbar Singh is introduced is classical where he is shown walking on the rocks revealing only his legs .However there are contradictory aspects in the film's script like a Thakur defending the lives of the village peasants(Traditionally Thakurs were landlords who terrorised the peasants)and 2 urban based gangsters wishing to settle down in a village.Sholay falls marginally short of a classic like Mughal -E-Azam.It does not relate to Social reality as films like ""Mother India'or Do Bhiga Zameen' nor has the philosophical depth of films like 'Pyaasa' or 'Mera Naam Joker'.That does not deny that it is the best film of it's type ever made in India and it's impact on the Indian psyche has been unparalleled in the history of Indian Cinema.The acting of Amjad Khan and Sanjeev Kumar are displays of true genius.There is also a moral aspect to the film unlike the Italian Spaggheti westerns of the 1960's.By Harsh Thakor"
"this possibly is the GREATEST movie ever made. The story, screenplay, cinematography, Direction, action is all top class. THe movie made with primitive equipment has withstood the test of time and probably will rule the minds of generations to come. It will be an understatement to say that sholay is a cult movie cause it is much more than that. It is a statement on the times(the '70s) and is the greatest cast ever assembled and the best technicians ever assembled. And for all the sholay connieuers the book on ""making of sholay"" is a must read. The director has to take the credit for backing such a monumental work and carrying it off brilliantly. Interestingly except for 1 award the film did not get any filmfares or critical acclaim but the movie still rules the hearts of millions of fanatics."
"In the Indian mythological epic - Ramayan, Sage Vishwamitra asks King Dashrath for his sons - Ram and Lakshman to take on the might of the evil demons, creating havoc in the pious forests inhabited by the saints and finally the twosome kills all the evil ones, restoring peace and Dharma once again.Millenniums later, in the celluloid era, a movie was made in Japan - Seven Samurai (1954) which portrayed the story of a veteran Samurai (Japanese militaryman) taking six others with him to get the better of a dangerous bandit which is synonymous with terror in his village. This story inspired many Indian cine-script writers to make its Bollywoodish versions which came in the form of Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971), Khote Sikkay (1974), Karma (1986), Army (1996), China Gate (1998), Keemat (1998) etc. However the most impactful of the Indianized versions of Seven Samurai is definitely - Sholay (1975) which was written by the high-profile cine-script writers, Salim-Javed. Though they had taken inspiration from Seven Samurai, yet, by default, Sholay turned out, not at all a shadow of these or any other movie on similar lines. It developed an identity of its own and became a legendary movie of the Indian cinema.Sholay (flames) is based on the theme of the revenge-seeking mission of an ex-copThakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) whose all family members but for himself and his young daughter-in-law, Radha (Jaya Bhaduri) have been killed by the dangerous dacoit - Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) who has deprived him of his hands too. Handicapped Thakur seeks the help of two petty thieves - Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jay (Amitabh Bachchan) who visit his village, Ramgarh only to earn money in return of helping him. However knowledge of the truth transforms their hearts and they fight tooth and nail with the bandit and his gang, Jay loses his life in this mission whereas Veeru gains the love of his life in the form of Basanti (Hema Malini).It is said that good pieces are made through hard, sincere and planned work but masterpieces are born by default. The same thing has happened to Sholay. It's a masterpiece by default and not by deliberate effort. The screenplay contains many loopholes and its definitely over-dramatic, devoid of the naturalness to a large extent. Still it keeps the viewer hooked. In fact, had the story been portrayed naturally, perhaps it would not have been able to be considered a masterpiece. The over-the-top nature of the picturization alongwith comic and witty dialogues (and their memorable delivery) is something which makes this entertaining movie nor only more entertaining but also an unforgettable experience for the viewer. This only provides unmeasurable repeat value to this movie. No surprise that several spectators have watched it dozens of times.There are two major plus points of this movie adding spice to its already high entertainment value - 1. The mannerisms of the villain, Gabbar Singh and his theatrical dialogue delivery, 2. The comedy generated by Veeru, Basanti, Jay and some insignificant characters like the Jailer of the British times (Asrani) and Soorma Bhopali (Jagdeep). The scene of Veeru climbing up the water tank in a drunken state, threatening to commit suicide and demanding the hand of Basanti in marriage, is definitely the best comedy scene of Dharmendra's career.Sholay is just like a dish in every ingredient and every required spice is just optimum, making it a highly delicious one rendering the eater a taste to remember forever. And that taste is such that it draws the eater again and again towards the dish. It's not a realistic movie about the bandits of India. It's an entertaining movie, providing wholesome entertainment through the activities of the characters who may not be found in this world. I consider Sholay as the biggest fantasy whose unique characteristic is that apparently it does not render the look of a fantasy.Director Ramesh Sippy has directed the movie well despite loopholes and inconsistencies which are overlooked by us because we are mesmerized by the entertainment we get through the narrative. Technical and production value aspects are quite high despite the fact that almost the whole story takes place in the rural setting. Music by R.D. Burman is quite OK, neither excellent, nor bad. The biggest strength of the movie is the dialogues, especially the dialogues of the villain, Gabbar Singh. These dialogues alongwith Gabbar Singh, his sidekick - Saambha (played by Mac Mohan) and a member of his gang - Kaalia (played by Viju Khote) have become so popular that now they are a part of the Indian folklore. Who can forget - 'Arre O Saambha' and 'Tera Kya Hoga Kaaliya'.The high-profile star cast of Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri has excelled in the roles assigned. Everybody gets full marks for the underplay (Amitabh, Jaya and Sanjeev) and overplay (Dharmendra-Hema) as required by the situation in the scene. Asrani has been given the get-up of Hitler in his completely over-the-top role of Angrezon Ke Zamaane Ka Jailer (the Jailer of the British times) but he and others like him generate laughters as demanded by their roles. Leela Mishra, A.K. Hangal, Sachin etc. also leave their mark in their cameos. And finally, it's Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) who has become immortal because of this movie. Never in the history of cinema, a villain had amassed so much popularity which overtook the popularity of the hero / heroes. Amjad Khan never got such a role in his career again and also could never come out of the hangover of this role. Gabbar Singh with his mannerisms has become a legend.Sholay is a movie in which the negatives also turned out to be the positives and everything just fell in place to render it a class of its own. It has been re-released many times and the Indian folklore has absorbed it."
"Sholay is one of the best Indian movies ever made. Every cast fits the role to perfection be in Amitabh as Jay or Dharm as Veeru or Hasrani as the cop or ..... the list is never ending. A movie worth watching 100 times with some great stuff music from RD.Fights which are the best ever made in Indian history. The climax wonderful, the work excellent its got no flaws what so ever. This movie when aired on screens just keeps getting revenue. Even now it did.A movie which changed the life of Bachhan moving him to the no 1 spot from where on Bachan went on to become all time best. Sippy needs special admiration for remaking this western classic in a very special Indian way"
"This is unarguably the best Hindi movie of all times till date. It arrests your atention even after 26 years it was released. Each time you see the movie, you find newer things to admire. Its just too good.It is THE MOVIE you are guaranteed to enjoy for unlimited number of times."
"Alright, this has to be the single most over hyped movie ""bollywood"" has ever produced. I mean what the hell! Slow movie combined with horrible acting and extremely stupid story line, not to mention the absolutely meaningless song and dance scenes pasted into this chaotic collage of scenes. The story clearly taken out of Seven samurai and The Good the Bad and the Ugly, but doesn't do even a % of justice to the film. I cannot fathom how such movies are being gobbled down by the culture here. Simply stupid and a big waste of time. Do not watch this movie! PS : Ashamed of my own culture. The lack of maturity is astounding."
"Before I review this movie..Id like to make a statement: Indian, especially Hindi movies will not appeal to the western user unless he his very familiar with indian culture /asian culture. Indian movies are very popular in almost the whole world except for the americas, western europe, and south east asia including japan and china.Sholay is probably the most popular hindi movie ever made. It was made in 1975 and played a very important part in establishing amitabh bachhan as the superstar of hindi cinema. It made a small time character actor named amjad khan into one of the most famous movie stars in India. The plot is relatively simple and straight forward with the normal love story, violence evil v/s good, etcc in a hindi movie. What makes it outstanding are the brilliant dialogues, the amazing performance especially the ease with which the two lead stars amitabh and dharmendra switch from comedy to action at the drop of the hat. The movie also contains probably the most famous lines delivered in bollywood namely ""Kitne aadmi the?"" or ""How many men were they?""It is an evergreen movie , and even 30 years later it rocks..."
"I can't believe that this is considered one of the greatest Indian films ever. The acting throughout is comical and unsubtle, the action scenes laughable and poorly executed, and the screenplay disjointed and confusing, especially all the ridiculous back stories that keep disrupting the meager narrative flow. Technically the film is embarrassingly primitive, on par with early Edison and Lumiere brothers shorts. Except for the sound, the over-exposed color photography and the bell-bottom pants, think 1905, not 1975. Every film that is said to have inspired Sholay--Seven Samurai, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Great Train Robbery (1903), and even The Great Dictator (the character of the jailer is clearly lifted from Chaplin's classic spoof of Hitler)--is in every way superior to this three-and-a-half-hour monstrosity."
"Only one word for this move ... PERFECTION!Even 24 years on, I can seriously say I have not seen anything that comes close!This film has action, dancing, singing, romance, villains, all rolled into the most complete film ever! The character building is very strong. The dialogue is unforgettable. How can anyone ever forget Gabbar Singh's classic lines throughout the whole film.Lets put it this way, the film was selling out at the big screen when I went to India in 1982 (seven years after release). Millions of movie-goer's cant be wrong!!!"
"The Indian filmmaker G.P. Sippy died last December at the age of 93. his son Ramesh directed this film, which remains the most famous Hindi-language movie and the biggest commercial success for Bollywood. If you want to watch one Bollywood film in his honor, this is it.This epic has everything. It has a magnificent Seven type story, but there are only two who come to save the village. They are thieves hired by a former policeman to capture the bandit leader.It is a spaghetti-western of sorts as there are plenty of horses, and shooting, and fights.It is a lavish musical with amazing color and costumes as the villagers really put on a show for their simple festival of colors.It has comedy, slapstick, romance (but NO kissing!), music, a little horror, almost continuous action, tragedy, and triumph. Like, I said, if you only see one Sippy production, this should be it."
"For heaven's sake watch the movie again - Each and every shot was meticulosuly shot - each and every ""STAR"" was treated the same as an ""extra"" - Original one crore and one year almost took 3 crore and 3 years to complete - even with the Censors and public's initial bad response not one SCENE was re shot ...IT IS A MASTERPIECE - everything from MUSIC, Editing, acting, Lyrics, direction, cinematography, action .. everything - not one movie comes close to this - No wonder after 25 years its still draws house full crowed...you are not doing justice by just saying ""I don't think this should be in the top 250""..I respect Satyajit Ray and all the others but I have done research on this movie for over 20 years - and don't agree with you here Feel free to send me any doubts and or questions that you might have. I will do my best to answer. I would also like to start a fan club for this movie - if you would like to be a part of this let me know Thanks Singh"
"I rented ""Sholay"" from an Indian store around where I live and I loved every moment of it! It's funny, sad, romantic, and very ACTION PACKED! Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan have excellent chemistry. I loved the the Buddy Buddy song they sing together, it's really cute and funny but ""Holi Ke Din"" is the BEST song! I was particularly touched by the ""silent"" love between Bachchan and his real life wife Jaya Bhaduri. The movie is well acted, Bachchan's character reminded me of James Dean and Steven McQueen. And I was haunted by Bhaduri's performance. On a shallow note, the lead men in this movie are some serious eye candy, especially Bachchan. I was thought he was a handsome guy back in the day, (Hell, he still is!) but in Sholay, he's so incredibly GORGEOUS! I mean, I was drooling over him! This movie is a must see for Bachchan fans.P.S. Parents, this movie is VERY,VERY, VERY violent! Children and young adults are killed brutally. It's a PG-13er all the way..."
The main thing about this movie is that despite having a village background it will appeal to all movie fans. The superb interpretation of Gabbar Singh by Amjad Khan is beyond compare. Even though the story is one liner the script is very good.And then there are those famous dialogues by amjad khan
"This movie was absolutely breath-taking and amazing. I watched it for the first time a few weeks ago and my views and perceptions on films has changed dramatically. No other movie lives up to the marvel of ""Sholay""."
"I completed the top 250 during the last couple of weeks, which meant that I had to see a lot of Indian movies. Though I did not become a fan of Bollywood cinema, there were a few good movies among them. Udaan is a very strong movie, and Sholay is also very enjoyable.Sholay borrows a lot from established movies, mainly westerns. The family murder scene was very similar to a scene in Once Upon a Time in the West. The action is technically not as good as Hollywood (the blood looks ridiculous), but it doesn't prevent me from enjoying the movie. It contains a few classic elements (like the coin with heads on both sides), that we've seen before, so it doesn't surprise anymore.The film makers changed to movie enough to Indian values and style, such that this wasn't an unnecessary remake of the classic westerns. I thought the two main characters were very likable, there war some plot twists I didn't see coming, and there were also some funny side characters (I liked the jailer a lot)."
"The action, the dialogue, the plot, the characters, the story, the setting and even the music pull together incredibly strongly to create one of the most memorable and perfectly realized films ever committed to the big screen. There are all Bollywood films ever made on the one hand and then there is Sholay in a category of its own. Take one 'Once Upon A Time In The West' as a basic foundation, add the best aspects of Le Samourai, Star Wars, Jaws, Terms Of Endearment, Grease and Midnight Run, transplant to the parched red-clay landscapes of Southern India circa 1975 and you have a film called Sholay. Calling it a curry western is like calling Citizen Kane a detective story. There's more, so much more. While most Indians will score this film 10/10, non-Indians will probably only score it a 7 - the film is absolutely and deeply marinated in Indian sensibilities which touch thrillingly at the heartstrings of the Indian soul. As much a cultural document as a film. P.S. Note how a train signals the beginning and end of the story, note how high-voltage action scenes alternate with light-hearted comedy all the way through the film and note how four types of man (or levels of consciousness) are manifest through the characters - the reprobate (Gabbar), the wayward (Jai and Veeru), the brave (Thakur) and the saintly (the old Muslim man). This one's a humdinger !"
"An amazing story that encompasses love, hate, adventure, an attempted train robbery, tragedy and pure evil in the personification of Gabbar Singh. The dialogue has become legendary in its own right, from the cowardice of Soorma Bopali and the pompous wit in the form of the ""English"" Jailor, to Jai's deflating discussions with Veeru anmd Gabbar's terrifying words to his henchmen - ""tera kya hoga kaliya?""."
"They even do spaghetti westerns better than we do!!!Despite a couple of sloppy visual mistakes (you can see the coupling towing a motorcycle and towards the end an assistant peeks his head up behind a bush behind a very pivotal scene), this is an excellent movie.The acting is fabulous. The plot line engaging. The horse chases are amazing. There is a horse chase with a train, horse chasing carriages, bridges being destroyed. A guy taking a horse down with his bare hands! It is filmed in a location with large rock formations - like the Vasquez rocks where so many US westerns were filmed so that the shootouts have that same western feel. It even has an Ennio Morricone style soundtrack! But I don't ever remember being this emotionally engaged - on the edge of my seat biting my fingernails with tension engaged - watching a Sergio Leone movie. And I love Sergio Leone. The bad guy is crazy bad. The good guy is crazy too - his final scene where he fights the bad guy unarmed - you would NEVER see that in a US movie. The story is heartbreaking at the end - I cried. Not as much as I do when reading a Zane Grey novel - but still - it's pretty heartbreaking and so well acted!!! My one request is for someone good, like Vinod Chopra, to remake this movie starring Abhishek and Faran Akhtar. And I know this movie is so good no one wants to remake it, but ... the remake of Don with SRK is excellent and even better than the original. And I hear the remake of Agneepath is excellent too. With the right director and cast - yeah - I totally want to see what Abhishek does with the role!! And Faran - yeah- him too! What would make my fantasy remake of this movie complete? Amitabh in the role of Thukar. This movie is a perfect example of why I've pretty much stopped watching western movies. Indian movies are better. Even their westerns are better!"
"In the small Indian village of Ramgarh, a former policeman and wealthy landowner named Thakur Baldev Singh approaches Veeru and Jai, two petty criminals whom he has formerly arrested in the line of duty. He offers the two men 20,000 rupees, plus an official reward of 50,000 rupees, if they will track down and capture alive an infamous bandit named Gabbar Singh, against whom the Thakur (an Indian title roughly equivalent to ""Lord"") has a particular reason for desiring revenge. The reason why the Thakur is so anxious for revenge on Gabbar will become clear later in the story. This plot line clearly shows the influence of the conventions of the Western. Yet in many other ways ""Sholay"" is a very different film from anything likely to be produced by the American (or for that matter the European) cinema. At over three hours in length, for example, it is much longer than the standard ""revenge Western"". It is an example of what have become known in India as ""Masala films"" because they consist of a mixture of different elements- drama, comedy, romance, music- in the same way as the curry dish masala consists of a mixture of different spices. Judged by Western criteria, ""Sholay"" would seem like a very poor piece of film-making indeed. Not only is it insanely overlong, the various elements which make up the plot do not seem to gel together at all well. The main story is a dark, brooding tale of sadism, bloodshed and revenge, which recalls not only the conventions of the Western but also those of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Yet this bloody tale is often interrupted by cheerful musical numbers, light-hearted scenes of romance and comic interludes. I know that Shakespearean tragedies did sometimes make use of so-called ""comic relief"", but these scenes, like the porter scene in ""Macbeth"" or the gravedigger scene in ""Hamlet"" are generally characterised by a grim black humour, very different to the farcical slapstick on offer in ""Sholay"". The scenes involving Veeru and Jai's adventures in prison, or Veeru's romance with his pretty but talkative girlfriend Basanti, or the gypsy dance sequence, seem quite incongruous when set side by side with the serious parts of this film. This is, moreover, more than just a question of incongruity. These frequent diversions also slow down the main action and prevent it from developing smoothly and coherently. And yet this is clearly not a film which is intended to be judged by Western criteria. I am not a great expert on Indian cinema, but it seems clear that the conventions of Indian film-making are quite different to those which prevail in the West. (Indeed, the difference seems greater than that between Western films and those from other parts of Asia, such as China and Japan). This is clear not only from the ""masala"" structure of the film but also from much of the acting, especially Sanjeev Kumar's highly stylised, non-naturalistic portrayal of the Thakur. The film was not rated very highly when it came out; one critic described it as a ""dead ember"" (the literal meaning of ""sholay"" in Hindi), and it was, paradoxically, criticised for copying Western models too directly. Today, however, it is widely considered in India to be a classic. For this reason I find it a difficult film to review, and I have decided not to award it a mark out of ten, as such a mark would only reflect my own cultural background, a background very different from that of those who made the film and of those for whom it was intended."
"I cant believe this movie has a rating of only 7.6 here.We are talking about THE SHOLAY here. Perhaps the best Indian movie of all time.Everybody whether they are old or of new generation has this film at least once.Somebody even seen about 50 times.Me personally seen this 20 times.Every time i watch i get completely mesmerized by it.It has become a part of our culture.The character names or the incidents are used in our everyday lives.I bet there is not a single soul who does not know this film.It is beyond great.You cant describe such films.They have their own place from where you cant displace them.It is like a ""Dhruv Tara"".As long as Indian film industry lives it will remain the numero uno film.As somebody said i quote ""indian films are divided in two parts 1]pre sholay 2]post sholay"".Everything in this film is great."
"Gabbar Singh is firmly entrenched in Indian cinema history as being a very popular villain. This is mainly due to Amjad's tour-de-force performance but also partly due to the way Ramesh Sippy introduces his character into the film. He allows suspense to build-up through several characters' hushed mentions of the notorious bandit. Gabbar does not make his screen appearance until after one song and a lot of scenes have gone past. Even then his face is not shown immediately at first. The sound of shoes clashing onto the rock signifies Gabbar's entrance. The camera shows his henchmen's terrified faces from the angle of Gabbar's shoes. This is a comment on the power that he wields over his yes-men. He is above them and can control whomever he wants. He believes that he is as powerful as God. He has a very maniacal laugh that would not sound out of place in a mental asylum.Sholay had a string of extremely fine performances by all the actors. It is very difficult to pinpoint on any one of them, saying he or she was the best. Whether it was Amitabh or Dharmendra, Hema or Jaya in her brilliantly essayed cameo, or the towering Sanjeev Kumar as the 'thakur'. They surpassed their own credentials.What can one say about this film that has not already been said by thousands of others? Yet, ""Sholay"" is the type of film that no matter how many times is talked about or frequently played at cinemas, movie buffs never tire of it. A sign of an evergreen classic. For everyone has their own different favorite moment or scene that they recall fondly from the movie. Be it Basanti (Hema Malini) chatting away nines to the dozen or Gabbar Singh 's(Amjad Khan) booming voice philosophizing, ""Jo darr gaya samjho margaya (Who ever is scared is dead)"". Or the sound of the swing squeaking after the dacoits have inflicted their reign of terror on the household of Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar). Sholay is easily the greatest film ever made in the history of Indian cinema.It is a must watch movie before dying for anyone who has even the slightest interest to see masterpieces."
"Watched this one many times during 1975 to 1980. In the 90s watched it on VCR and now on DVD. Nothing matched the experience of watching on mint condition 70 mm print with 6 track stereo sound among 1200 fans in theater on the first day ( It came late to Madras on Dec 5th 1975). Only time I felt that it is not all original was when I watched the train scene of the English western and learnt the thrilling scenes and angles were carbon copy. Still for a Hindi movie at that time it was breath taking.After this many years I still enjoy ( remember the lines of this movie despite the fact that I don't speak Hindi ) . In fact my entire vocobulary of Hindi will have 80% for words spoken in this movie. For a 3hr 15 mins movie, not much was spoken.The alternate ending being shown now does not really matter anymore. It would have been a hit whichever way it ended."
"Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar), once a senior police officer, hires two small-time crooks, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jaidev (Amitabh Bachchan) to bring the dreaded dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) to him alive. How Jai and Veeru plan to capture Gabbar Singh and bring him to Thakur forms the rest of the movie. In the village, Veeru falls in love with the garrulous but winsome Basanti (Hema Malini), while the more serious Jaidev feels drawn to Radha.Sholay had all the elements of a Western - rugged countryside (the film was shot in the rocky landscape of Ramnagaram a small village about 30 miles from Bangalore), bandits on horseback, fierce gun fights etc. Sholay's phenomenal success can be attributed to perhaps the way it was able to blend the various items or 'masalas' required in a Hindi film in exactly the right doses. Practically every scene, dialogue and even a small character was a highlight. Even Dhanno, the horse of the tangewali, Hema Malini is remembered till today! Every small character be it the Jailer (Asrani), Mausi (Leela Mishra) or Sambha (Mac Mohan) - they are etched in viewer's minds.In India, Sholay is not just a movie... it is a legend. There are people in India who remember each and every character of the movie vividly even now - 31 years after it was first released !!! this is the beauty of the film. Every character is so well sketched. It is the highest grossing film of all time in India. It has earned about Rs. 2,134,500,000, equivalent to US $ 50 million, after adjusting for inflation. It ran for 286 weeks straight in one Mumbai theatre, the Minerva. Using sentences like ""Arre O Samba"", ""Ab Tera Kya Hoga Kaaliya?"" mothers frightened their children with the name of Gabbar Singh. Sholay was loud, garish, but it had something which touched everyone's heart. Shot in 70mm with stereophonic sound, Sholay was the ultimate big screen experience. It was India's first film in 70 mm with stereophonic sound. Mention must be made of Dwarka Diwecha's stunning camera-work and R.D. Burman's evocative background score, which help elevate the film even further."
"What should i say or write ? No words, Nobody can describe in words about SHOLAY.Its a landmark movie in Bollywood Cinema same like Mother India, Paathar Paanchali...Its a movie of the century in Bollywood Cinema.After this much year everybody know about Gabbar Singh, Jay, Veeru,Basanti,Soorma Bhopali,Jailer and Jaya Even Dhanoo and Non other than Thakur.Tera Kya Hoga Kalia..... Saap ha-tho SE Nani paro SE kuchla... Tumhara naam kya hai Basanti... These dialouge like a words of the century."
"Film reviewFilm name Sholay classic Cast Amitabh Bachchan Dharmedra Amjad Khan Sanjeer Kumar Jaya Bachchan Hema malin The storyline about 2 thieves who are Jai (Amitabh) & Veeru (Dharmedra) who help Thakar (Sanjeer) to capture Gabber (Amjad ) who is a bigger criminal. I like this film because everything was great I liked the songs and it was funny and with lots of action.Performance : it was a great performance from all the actors .One part I didn't like was when Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) dies, it was very sad .Yes, I do recommend the film to all of you, it 's an all rounder & I have seen this film 10 times."
"Before adding my own review of this widely acknowledged iconic film of Hindi cinema, I went through several of the reviews of this film. Majority of the reviewers appear to have been born just before or just after this film was first released in August 1975. In other words, they didn't experience it firsthand at theaters and were probably already preconditioned with all the incredible hype surrounding this film. I remember its original release at Minerva Theater in Bombay very well. I have seen this film in both its endings: The one in which the Gabbar Singh character gets killed by Thakur and the alternative ending where Thakur just stops short of killing Hari ""Gabbar"" Singh at the behest of the police. Salim Khan (father of actor Salman Khan) and Javed Akhtar wrote one of the most memorable dialogues for a Hindi film character in Gabbar Singh. However, this film's key storyline is nothing but a rip off of several classic Westerns: Both from Sergio Leone and from John Sturges' remake of Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI. Gabbar's killing of Thakur's family is nothing but a rip off of Henry Fonda's ""Frank"" who kills off the McBain family (including McBain's little boy) in Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Amjad Khan (son of veteran Hindi film villain Jayant) owns this film. Without his interpretation of Gabbar Singh, this film would not be worth watching. With that being said, his interpretation of Gabbar is also a rip off of the great Italian actor Gian Maria Volonte's ""Indio"" from Leone's FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. The base theme of SHOLAY is a Hindi reworking of SEVEN SAMURAI / THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. The vast majority of the Hindi film audience who praised SHOLAY to no end were not aware that its key points were plagiarized from the classic Italian and Hollywood Westerns. There were also some really silly scenes: Dharmendra's ridiculous mock ""suicide""; the very annoying Basanti character of Hema Malini; etc. Aside from Gabbar Singh, the only interesting characters were that of Thakur (portrayed by Sanjeev Kumar) and Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law (portrayed by Jaya Bhaduri). Film director Ramesh Sippy ought to be ashamed of his plagiarism of the classic Westerns he ripped off and never openly credited. Aside from the key action scenes, SHOLAY really drags. SHOLAY is hardly a true ""Hindi"" film in the tradition of Golden Age classics of Hindi cinema which were truly Indian subjects (e.g., Roti-1942; Do Bigha Zamin; Pyaasa; Sahib, Bibi, aur Ghulam; Mughal-E-Azam; Pakeezah; etc.). SHOLAY is one of those movies which can be truly be labeled ""Bollywood""...AKA when (way too often) Hindi cinema rips off Hollywood. Having seen SHOLAY in its 2nd week of release back in late August 1975 at Minerva Theater and a couple of times since, I can only state that SHOLAY is the most overrated Hindi film ever."
"'Serious' critics are always complaining about the mind-numbing effects of action blockbusters, yearning for a time when pop didn't automatically mean pap.  Although they really wish kids in Paloma would be enthralled by Tarkovsky, 'Sholay' is an example of popular cinema that neither panders, patronises nor bludgeons its audience, and, while providing the most exhilirating melange of comedy, violence, romance and song, as all action films should, but never do, it wires the audience's visceral excitement to more thoughtful ends.  This does not mean - the horror! - that it is an art film in action clothing, as some of its embarrassed allies insist on calling it; there is not one moment here, transposed, that would stick out in a Hollywood movie (well, maybe the songs).  It is the manner of presenting the action and humour that might get a viewer thinking, about genre, tone, what subjects are appropriate to be shown, how they should be shown, etc.  it's a huge, but achievable, step from thinking about the nature of a film to questioning the society that produced it.I don't know much about Bollywood cinema, but I do know about Westerns, and 'Sholay', heavily influenced by the spaghettis, has been called, either dismissively, or affectionately, a 'curry' Western.  Such a term does have the virtue of hinting at the density and, dare I say it, spicy potency of the film.  The most obvious influence is Leone, in the way a specifically American genre is wrenched out of context and made strange; in the unsettling mixture of flippancy and deadly seriousness; in playing havoc with the conventions of the genre, expressing especially its latent campness; in the elaborate gunplay and extended mini-film flashbacks; in the sharp lurches from spatial depth to juttering montage; in the glorious stew of a score, mixing the required Bollywood dance routines (here brilliantly subversive, elaborate and funny) with weirdly inappropriate Western themes, played on a mournful harmonica.  There are more literal homages to Leone, especially 'Once upon a time in the West' - the importance of trains; the tangible creak of wood; the comical extras on the periphery; the El Indio-like sweating villain; the virtual remake of the McBain slaughter in 'West', where a cold-blooded avenger massacres an entire family. This last transposing is particularly effective because of its reversal of gender, and the ghostly unveiling of the corpses by the wind has an overpowering effect. Whereas leone, however, took the Western out of America to fiercely critique the ideological assumptions of the Western; the Sippis take it to energise Bollywood formulae; but there is a political awareness amid the escapism, a sense of the random violence and division inherent in post-colonial India. 
Plot elements lifted wholesale from the likes of 'The Magnificent Seven', via 'The Seven Samurai' (bandits defend village from marauders), and 'The Wild Bunch' (the second most awesome train sequence in movies), emphasise this.  The politics seem to be moving toward the regressive, despite the stylistic pyrotechnics - the heroes defend a feudal system; their criminal transgression (and homo-erotic co-dependence) slowly abandoned as they accept marriage and children, just as the strong female character, the only one who appears to work in the village, and who has unmistakably a 'voice', wants to settle down.  The villain is clearly Communist - his purges are Stalinist, his beard and green uniform are Castro, his cruelties are anti-family.  His propaganda briefly encourages the locals to rise against their lord.  Everything seems to be heading for reactionary restoration and renewal.  It doesn't work like that.  As the film progresses towards its horrific denouement, the formal aspects become more troubling, the mix of comedy and tragedy more uneasy - a man's hands being lopped off registered by a punning edit: is this funny or horrifying?  The dance movements - supposedly a Bakhtinian suspension of everyday order, by suspending narrative order, celebrating the Carnivalesque - are deprived of pleasurability.  When the heroine is forced to dance to save her lover's live - a mode so bound up in sexual gratification of the male viewer becomes tantamount to a gang-rape.  The vengeance that consumes the Inspector poisons any chance of a return to order - all the references to Shakespeare remind us of another prominent patriarch whose family was destroyed, and who had his hand cut off, Titus Andronicus. 
I don't want to make the film sound gloomy - it is every Buster Keaton short ever rolled into one, remade by Leone in the style of Peckinpah with brilliantly silly English-style farce.  But it's even more than that."
"My father and I anxiously popped in this DVD that was suggested by a friend. After reading many reviews and seeing the high rating on IMDb I thought we were in for a real treat. What a load of garbage this movie turned out to be. A combination of all the wrong ingredients for a epic western. Growing up on Rio Bravo, Bite the Bullet and The Professionals I couldn't wait for Sholay to end. Sholay is three hours of total misunderstanding of Western movie culture. My view of Bollywood movies has been tainted for quite a while with this movie. John Wayne would be rolling over in his grave if he saw two-cowboys in leisure suits, with poor comic relief. I will describe one seen from the movie. The two wanted heroes get caught and are serving jail time. The new warden at the jail is a poor representation of Charlie Chaplin playing Hitler. That was one of the few highlights... In conclusion this is a horrible movie that tries to mesh musicals, comedy, and drama from Western culture into a Bollywood hit. It might have worked for Bollywood, but any fan of Hollywood westerns would be smart to steer clear of this crap."
"This is best ever made Indian movie. Having everything starting with comedy to ending with thrill. It covers all areas. It deserves to be called as the best movie in Hindi cinema. Nothing could be as great as this. Just go on and watch it. Don't watch just once. Watch watch and keep watching in every few months. Nice story with nice direction, nice acting by each character. Everything in just one movie. I comment could be best movie ever seen.What more you want to read. I feel this is sufficient. Just don't delay any more. Go for movie. Watch acting by amitabh, darmendra, angrejo ke jamane ka jailer and basanti. See the beauty of the dialogs. Gabar is the best part of the movie, Keeping you alive to watch a good fight."
"Two Friends who are like brothers, get into a spot when they agree to bring in a notorious dacoit for a person, alive. The cops have got a healthy tag on his head (Dead or Alive) but this man wants him alive, to avenge his family's death. Amidst all this things turn personal when the dacoit captures a village girl the love of Viru's life and kills Jai in action. The short tempered Viru gets infuriated by the death of his best friend and gets the job done by capturing Gabbar, the dacoit.One of the landmarks in Indian movie history, Sholay is just another story of the life style in a typical village in the late 60's and early 70's. Common thieves snaking their way out of prison, boys falling in love with simple village girls. Ramesh Sippy brings out the story very clearly through a lucid script and Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra play the part of the two inseparable friends Jai and Viru to perfection. Amjad Khan, the man who went on to become the villain for many future movies, makes a superb debut with Gabbar. Hema Malini plays the role of the simple but outspoken village girl very well and Jaya Bhaduri is also marvelous as the widow of the landlord. But the entire movie stands out and is based on two characters. Gabbar and Thakur. Sanjeev Kumar gives a mind blowing performance as the handicapped thakur, a retired police inspector who is crippled by Gabbar, for sending him to jail. As a consequence for his actions he kills off Thankur's family members sparing him and his youngest daughter in law. An excellent movie which also brings out the smooth and melodious music which creates a grim emotion for the viewer. Overall, it is well worth watching and it may be considered to be a ""The Good, Bad and The Ugly"" of the east. 10/10 from me.........."
"This film is for everyone, has everything you would want from a film and will never cease to amaze you however many times you watch it.The music captures you from the first song to the last, the action is breathtaking, the romance subtle and in you face with the two love stories respectively. The drama and suspense has you sitting on the edge of your seat and I defy anybody not to have a tear in the eye when Jai is close to death and the slow version of dhosti is played over the scene. The comic timing of the characters is excellent, Dharamendra is brilliant, Amitabh is wonderfully moody, Hema is stunning and Amjad is the best baddie in any film ever! All in all, the best bollywood movie of all time, introduced countless people to bollywood and kept them. Nothing better, before or since..."
"I didn't think much of Sholay till I actually saw it. I can understand why it's so famous.First of all...the acting! Ah! Just wonderful.Dharmendra plays the hero, who is basically comical...even while he's getting arrested. I mean, his jokes are just hilarious! And those funny faces he makes! I couldn't stop laughing! Then there's his best friend, who is played by Amitabh. Though Amitabh is not as goofy as his friend, he is funny. He makes all sarcastic comments and you can see why he shot into superstardom with his performance.
Though I never thought Hema Malini was a good actress...trust me, in this movie she is sooooo funny. The girl just can't stop talking! The scenes with Dharmendra and her are really funny. Then of course there's Jaya Bhaduri, who is more of the depressed type, and her and Amitabh fall in love just by sharing glances, it's awfully cute. Her gloomy look is very effective.Let's not forget Sanjeev Kumar, a good strong performance. He makes a dark voice that really adds effect on his character. At first he seems heartless, but later you realize that he does really care.The only performance that was not so good was Amjad Khan's, though many liked it. His stupid accent was not very enjoyable and it seemed like he was trying to get bhojpuri into his dialect when he shouldn't have been.So there are cons in this movie...the violence is not very good. I mean, I enjoy fist fights, but there's only one in this movie and the rest in like gun shots...which I think is boring. The music could've been much better. The only good songs are ""Haan Jab Tak"" and the other one that's okay was ""Holi Ke Din"". I think if Ramesh Sippy had taken someone like Laxmikant Pyarelal, the music would've been much much better.The beginning is really funny, Asrani as the overacting jailor is hilarious. The movie is very touching at the end though, very sad I'll have to say. Even though I'm telling you all the cons in the movie, I'm not saying that you shouldn't watch it...because you should! After watching this movie Dharmendra and Amitabh have become my favorite actors. It's a great movie, even though I have some stuff against it, because of the comedy and performances...I'll have to give it a ten out of ten."
"Sholay is one of those movies, the kind that you watch when no one else is around, so that you can laugh and get choked up without any one watching. The friendship between Dharmendra and Amithab was excellently put on film, the journeys between the two are remeniscent of the adventures of Butch Cassidy and Sundance.  I would definetly recommend this film, as it is a cornerstone of early Hindi blockbusters, and definetly worth watching."
"I still remember that day on which it was released in 1975 (aroundAugust 15).Sold out for three weeks in advance....My Father along with my Uncle got a pass to see to it on First day...Dharmendra came and sat beside them...It was very unusual....I had a experience of my life time in New Excelsior (70 mm) when Isaw it for second time... First time in Badal...Ramesh Sippy's best ever...Well written. Well Directed...But the most important thing was very well released....Dialogues and Songs were running in markets well beforerelease...People were very impatient for its release....It was my first time in New Excelsior Cinema...Couple of Samosas and Chicken Sandwich ( with Lettuce ) mademe very happy....Thanks and Regards.Sam RupaniHouston, Texas, United States of America.January 26, 2003. 1:35 PM.

"It's an Indian Cowboy Movie in the mould of SEVEN SAMURAI and YOJIMBO!A retired police captain recruits two career criminals to help him defend his village from a group of particularly nasty bandits. The two crooks are apparently the bravest men he ever met - and pretty good natured fellows too, for that matter. They agree to take the job, initially just for the cash, but gradually because they come to like the villagers and their lifestyle. Everything is rosy as they fend off the first bandit invasions, but everybody knows that bandits whose power rests totally on fear can't let it go when they suffer a loss.The movie doesn't really deviate too far from the genre format, but in its 3.5 hour runtime it gets chance to develop the story to quite a degree, and it's a pretty well crafted movie. I did shorten that runtime a little by forwarding through a couple of songs, but it still clocked in at 3+ hours and kept my interest throughout. The main reason for this is the performances - a good one from Dharmendra as one of the crooks, and a fantastic one from young Amitabh Bachchan as the other. Apparently this is the movie that made Amitabh a superstar, and you can see why. He easily steals the screen from the then more famous Dharmendra, oozing cool like James Dean on Quaaludes. Even he is sometimes in danger of losing screen command from their nemesis, the nasty bandit head Gabbar Singh (played by Amjad Khan). He's a villain who is given a lot more depth and character development than villains normally get in a movie. He's a bastard, for sure, but whilst you dislike him you also understand him, and perhaps secretly admire him.The character dynamics, and the cat and mouse play between our heroes and our villains are all very confidently handled, and deftly shaped. There's quite a bit of action, some of which is rather bad (the 'oh, you hit me - I should fall over now then' school of stuntmen), but some of which is quite thrilling. There's some comedy, mostly from the chatterbox village taxi girl and Dharmendra's attempts to seduce her, there's some melodrama and some pathos... and there's Amitabh nonchalantly wandering through it all like a king (it's hard to remember he's meant to be the 'sidekick' here). There's some song and dance routines naturally, though personally I wasn't too keen on some of the songs.SHOLAY is apparently considered to be one of the all time classics of Indian cinema. I haven't really seen enough Indian movies, especially pre-90's, to judge this, but I think the verdict is perhaps coloured slightly by nostalgia - or maybe needs to be seen in historical context. I don't think it's better than SATYA or ZAKHM anyway. I don't think it's quite as good as the Kurosawa movies that defined this genre either, but it's still rather a good movie :)."
"Sholay is a remarkable film...can you believe that Amitabh shot for both Sholay and Deewar at the same time?  He shot for Sholay in the day near Bangalore and took a train to Bombay at night to shoot for Deewar. The film features great performances all-around and is technically sound, the film has great editing.  A classic action film that includes Romance and Comedy...As far as entertainment is concerned this is the best of Hindi Cinema"
"There are few red blooded hindi speaking Indians who have not seen Sholay. It is the perfect example of the Masala Age of Indian movies. The nice mix of excellently shot chase sequences on horses and trains, the battles of guns and unarmed combat,the unforgettable comedy of Soorma Bhopali and the dances by Hema Malini. Even with the Full stable of Hindi movie cliches and predictability of the movie it remains the best and unmatched in its league. Amjad Khan (unbelievably slim in the movie) set the tone for a whole generation of villains."
"Even after 25 years and repeated viewing of this movie, I still can not find anything that I don't like about this movie.  If you have to see just one Hindi movie see this!  Every aspect of the movie is superb.  Special mentions to acting, music (background), photography and editing."
This is a fantastic movie and a must watch for all movie lovers.  Although the ending is somewhat sad (in my opinion) the movie is an icon for Indian cinema.  Never before had any single movie brought together such great actors and given each actor a lead role.  The characters in the movie are very powerful and very well depicted.  The theme of the movie was also very refreshing and the dialogues of the movie have been etched in each and every mind.  Furthermore the songs are very melodic.  It would have been fantastic had the movie been available on DVD.
"I love this movie, it has everything: a bit of humour, some romance, a tragic ending, a happy ending and also that undefinable something that gives a film Magic! The stars were never better, and Salim-Javed were at the peak of their powers in providing the script for this movie.  It's simply the best!"
"I remember buying the DVD for this cult classic,but I was hugely disappointed.
The movie is marred by overacting,over the top scenes.
I guess such loud acting was the norm back in the day but personally I wasn't impressed at all given the mountain of expectations this movie comes with.
This is your typical Bollywood ""masterpiece"", don't expect good cinema,that's all."
This movie deserve as a the movie of century. Definitely no doubt this movie meets its success after the remake of a Hollywood movie. Actors Amitabh Bachchan and Darminder Singh the two living legends had played a very good roles and specially Sanjeev Kumar one of the finest actor of Vintage era made the movie really interesting. The villain Gabbar made a fabulous performance. The music and direction made it the best for the audience. I really appreciate this because it was also my father's favorite movie.
"In the small village of Ramgarh, the retired policeman Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) summons a pair of small-time thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duo—Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan)—would be ideal to help him capture Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan), a dacoit wanted by the authorities for a ₹ 50,000 reward. Thakur tells them to surrender Gabbar to him, alive, for an additional ₹ 20,000 reward.The two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, although he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, which is why he could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl."
"How do you properly describe a film which feels like family? We know all the dialogues, our kids love doing Gabbar Singh imitations, and watching the film even for the first time gives us a feeling of deja- vu. Sholay is a part of every Indian, four decades after its release, and it will remain so for many decades more.How is the casting so perfect? How did Amjad Khan, a complete newbie to films, deliver such an iconic performance as Gabbar Singh? Did the legendary writer duo Salim-Javed have any idea that their dialogues would be recited decades later by my five-year old cousin? And how is it that Sholay has become nothing short of immortal?10/10"
