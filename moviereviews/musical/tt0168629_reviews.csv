Reviews
"The reviews were extremely black and white for this art-house film.  People were either enthralled or bored to tears by the whole experience.  There seemed to be no middle ground.  Now, that's my kind of movie.  Any picture that can reap awards (Cannes Film Festival) and get lambasted by the general public at the same time will always pique my interest.  In respect, it was a rich, rewarding odyssey, much easier to get through than, let's say, even half of ""8½.""  My initial respect for the unique, uncompromising style of Danish director Lars von Trier goes back to his compelling work in ""Zentropa"" and ""Breaking the Waves,"" both bleak, surrealistic studies of man vs. reality.  His pieces usually center around some innocent, simple-minded, self-sacrificing soul who inevitably succumbs to the cruelties of life.I found the central role of Selma (as played by the extraordinary Björk) to be very much the emotional equivalent of Emily Watson's touchingly childlike, near-sociopath Bess in ""Breaking the Waves"" -- blessed and cursed with a naive, soulful purity.  Selma represents one of God's little quirks of nature.  A bespectacled, pathetically infantile little ragamuffin completely out of touch, Selma has somehow survived like the runt of a litter would - through luck, will power, and the extreme kindness of those around her.  An impoverished Czech-born emigré living in a small Northwestern U.S. industrial town during the mid-60s, this luckless creature manages to eek out a meager Airstream-like existence as a factory worker, despite the fact she is legally blind.Selma is, amazingly enough, a mother.  Seemingly ill-equipped to care for a child much less herself, she has nevertheless managed to provide for the 12-year-old boy, while nurturing the child as a young girl would her rag doll.  The fairly adjusted boy suffers, however, from the same optic disease as the mother, while the crux of the story revolves around her attempts to save up money for his inevitable operation.    The fascination of ""Dancer in the Dark"" lies in Selma's musical world.  With her eyesight failing, her ears become the only sense of joy, falling periodically into bouts of fantasy anytime she grabs onto a rhythm or beat (like machine sounds, train engines, etc.), wherein she becomes the star of her own working-class musical production.  These compelling sequences become mere extensions of her real-life circumstances, i.e., the musical interludes at work will include the factory itself as a set piece and the other workers as her ensemble.  A strange mix of Fellini neo-realism and Busby Berkeley illusion, these daydreams (sparked by Vincent Paterson's inventive choreography and von Trier's purposely puerile lyrics) become her only escape.  Björk's odd musical talent and vocal style may be an acquired taste, but she is so mesmerizing here it becomes a non-issue.  In addition, there are brief moments of levity as a hopelessly inept community theater production of ""The Sound of Music"" goes into rehearsals with the very awkward Selma playing Maria.The subordinate cast is equally in tune.  The wonderful, beguiling French star Catherine Deneuve downplays her ethereal beauty as Kathy, Selma's co-worker and trusted friend.  And a strange, maternalistic friendship it is indeed, for this woman seems to have no other purpose in life than to be this girl's eyes and hands, looking out for her practically day and night. Peter (""Fargo"") Stormare shies away from his ruthless killer image with this touching portrayal of a sensitive, almost pitiable boor who only has eyes for the ungainly Selma.  David Morse is gripping as a seemingly compassionate but despairing policeman whose one desperate act involving neighbor Selma results in tragedy.  Joel Grey has a brief, telling moment near the film's end as a faded musical star idolized by Selma.As in his other featured works, von Trier's gritty, hand-held camera work may be dizzying to the point of distraction at first but its overall impact to the stark proceedings is unquestionable.  Moreover, the grueling paces he puts his actresses through to achieve absolute truth borders on misogyny but the rewards are tenfold.  As in the case of Emily Watson, Björk has never shined brighter as an artist.A harrowing, refreshingly original piece of filmmaking that should be experienced by anybody who dares to be different."
"It feels awkward to attempt to put Dancer in the Dark into words. Von Trier's film is one of those movies that truly change the way we think about cinema and its possibilities, and for such a film, words do no justice. Dancer in the Dark centers around Selma (Björk), a factory worker, who loves her 10-year-old son above everything else in the world. Selma is a happy, innocent creature who enjoys musicals for ""nothing bad ever happens in them"". These elements (mother's love for her son, joyfulness of musicals versus the hardships of every day life) create a whole unlike anything ever seen on silver screen.  Selma is rapidly losing her eye sight, but not her vision: she's the 'dancer in the dark' who is prepared to sacrifice herself to  keep the light in her child's eyes. Very early on it becomes obvious that this story can't have a happy ending. However, once you've accepted it, you can put your mind at ease and see the film as it unfolds from Selma's point of view. And what a view it is! Björk gives a performance of a life time - this little woman with a huge voice is all emotion all the time without ever  appearing overtly dramatic or cheaply sentimental. There's no weak link in the rest of the cast either, Peter Stormare as Jeff, Catherine Deneuve as Kathy and Siobhan Fallon as the prison guard to name but a few. The biggest star is still the director himself; von Trier demonstrates his talent in a superb fashion by both telling a simple story that will most likely break you heart and examining the ever-persistent ills of the life of the lower class of the American society. What about the film's musical character then? This is where von Trier triumphs the most by understanding the very essence of the whole genre - hope; hope that will live in our soul for ever if we'll only follow our heart."
"This is the most horrifying movie I've seen (gave it 10, though). I had the sensation that I was witnessing somebody die - and like Selma in the movie, I just begged for another musical-show to begin... I couldn't stand it. Everything is so tormenting and you just need that last (but not last!?) dance... Bjork is stunning as Selma, and the music she has composed blew me away. Even though this is perhaps the movie that has left the strongest impression with me ever, I don't know when I will be able watch it again."
"This is quite possibly the most moving film I've seen, it ensnares you within the first minute, or Bjork does with her interpretation of the sound of music, which is both hilarious and introduces one of the main themes: the magic of musicals. Not one of my favourite genres (but everyone loves The Sound Of Music, right?) but Lars Von Trier makes you re-evaluate your perception with a gentle loving pastiche of the way for no reason people and things in musicals spontaneously erupt into song, made more credible in this film by implicating a reason for it: Bjork's character is going blind so she hears music in the slightest thing and she, in her mind, sees how moves should be choreographed with the music she hears, reminiscent of her own It's Oh So Quiet' music video. And the best thing about this film is the way Bjork charms you with her portrayal of the nicest person in the world, she will do anything for you if she could. She is essentially an innocent and though this is her weakness you can't help but love her all the more: a sparkling performance from a unique singer in real life.However from this don't assume that this is a light happy film as there is a dark tragic side also, and this side is full of injustice, agony- and I mean agony-, sorrow- like you'd not believe-, and an intense emotional pull as I've ever felt in a cinema before, and it's this half that propels it from being just a great film to becoming one of the greatest. Its greatness is in telling a simple story of a woman trying to stop her own genetic sight disorder afflicting her son, by working every hour to afford the operation, working heavy machinery despite essentially being virtually blind, its greatness is its ability to inflict upon you the gift of feeling every conceivable emotion you posses and you do, you really do experience so much during this film. But I'll not say too much as my enjoyment of this film increased due to, for a change, not second guessing what would happen but to just let it be, I would say to passively watch but there's nothing passive about this film. It really moves you. It makes you feel alive.This film should be seen alone, in the quiet when you are all by yourself, but more importantly than that it should be seen: this is more than mere movie this is art this is real this is the greatest film I have ever seen: even better than Casablanca, and Shadowlands, and The Piano."
"After seeing Melancholia and Antichrist, and after reading lots of stuff about Lars von Trier and his movies, I thought I understood what kind of director he is. When I started watching his filmography, I was expecting everything, really, because I know people who've seen a lot of his movies and they were always telling me that his films are good, but extremely tough to watch. Especially Dancer in the Dark, a friend of mine said. So when I started watching it, I found out I was unprepared.Dancer in the Dark is a movie about Selma Jezkova (Björk), a factory worker from the '60s, who is slowly going blind. She has a genetic disease that she knows her 12-year old son will inherit, therefore she is saving up money so he can get an operation when he turns 13. She's extremely poor, she lives in a trailer she's renting from the town's policeman, Bill Houston (David Morse), who lives with his wife near Selma's trailer, and who is helping her with the money. Her only friends, Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and Jeff (Peter Stormare) help her as well in her everyday-life routine. Everything starts to go downhill when the policeman doesn't have any more money to give her and, taking advantage of the fact that she's going completely blind, steals all the money that she saved up for her son's operation. That's when Selma starts to 'dance in the dark', both literally and metaphorically.Dancer in the Dark is the third film in the so-called ""Golden Heart trilogy"" by Lars von Trier. I don't really know why the trilogy's called like that, but I can assume it's because the main character is a pure-hearted person, whose life gets destroyed by the people that surround him (in this case – her) and by the situations he finds himself in. At least, that's Selma's story. I think von Trier's goal here was to rip your heart out of your chest, squeeze it and make it explode. He took something so pure, innocent and beautiful as Selma, and made her suffer as much as he could. And all that you can do, as a viewer, is just watch the main character perish. I suffered along with the character, and it was really difficult to watch. I usually spontaneously empathise with the character, I try to experience what they're experiencing – and that surely didn't help. At the end of the movie, I was a train wreck, crying my eyes out. But maybe, the movie's problem is just in this.The movie wasn't particularly well-received, especially by the critics, and I see why people don't like it. It's not a pleasant movie to watch; everything in it makes you feel uncomfortable, and especially mainstream audiences feel uncomfortable, since the movie is so unconventional. It's filmed by following almost all of the Dogme 95 rules: it uses hand-held digital cameras to create a documentary-style look, with no background music. I didn't mind those characteristics, I actually loved them. What I think we all really agree on is that the real eye-candy of the movie is Björk. Her performance was outworldly, something unique in the history of cinema. Many said that Björk was so convincing that she became the character herself – and I agree with them. That wasn't acting, as her co-star Catherine Deneuve said: that was feeling. And what's even better – Björk was able to use her main talent, music, in the movie as well: Selma is a great musical fan, and she would often daydream, creating musical numbers in her head. In the movie, we would see what Selma imagined. The colors would brighten (this time using static cameras to film), Selma would be singing along with whoever surrounded her, and everything would be cheerful. The result of the combination of Björk's phenomenal voice and incredible acting performance was astonishing.But, as I was saying before, maybe the problem with the movie is that von Trier was using this 'destroying something beautiful' to get to the viewers. One could call it 'cheap storytelling', but isn't that the most effective way to get to someone's heart and then break it? Yes, it actually is. So, no, von Trier's masterplan here wasn't genius – he's just doing what he does best. But I don't really care. I don't think it's actually that easy to make someone feel such strong emotions. You've got to choose the right story, with the right characters (main and supporting), the right twists, the right directing, the right screenplay, the right tone and the right actors. Choosing Björk as the main character was a risk, since that was her first acting job. But her sweet, innocent appearance had an even greater effect on the whole movie experience, because it enhanced the beauty that was getting destroyed. I'm certain that the movie wouldn't have been this good without Björk's acting and music.So, personally, I loved the movie. I'm all for the emotions, and this one struck me good. But I loved everything about it: its uniqueness in the way it's filmed and directed, the dark but sometimes cheerful tone, the characters and the actors, etc. The above mentioned problem that many had with the movie wasn't a problem for me at all. Maybe it was too raw and harsh, but Lars von Trier really got everything right, in my eyes. Some may call it tedious and overly-melodramatic, but I think it was all done on purpose. The initial slow pace created the right situations and the right tone, and the twists that happened later in the movie felt earned and right-timed. It all felt very real as well. When the final credits started running, and my tears started flowing like crazy, my first thought was ""F**k you, Lars"". But then, it turned into a ""thank you"", because, as a critic said, ultimately, it's a tribute to the power of cinema."
"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I was not familiar with the director's previous work, but had picked up the soundtrack by Bjork and was intrigued.Selma (incredibly portrayed by Bjork) makes the audience laugh and weep simutaneously just by following her heart.  Every character is played flawlessly, and the cinemetography is innovative and dynamic.  The musical numbers jump to life in a 'colorized' style, emphasizing the break from the dismal reality of Selma's painfully decaying life.I will say only this.  I hate crying at movies.  Yet, as I was driving home, mad at the fact that I was still sobbing uncontrollably, I realized how much I loved this movie."
"This is distinguishably different from the general Hollywood films or independent projects. It's not like anything done before. LARS VON TRIER, and BJORK, simply blow your mind away: such totality in delivery!It's gut wrenching - an absorbing tearjerker - but not sentimental. It is in strong doses. (NFE: it may not be for everyone.) The theatre audience was very quiet with occasional sniffing heard. The film may be a fantasy, yet there are subtle jabs at certain social norms and contains hints at how we treat life and lead life.Bjork made it natural, innocent, and naively good. It is all Bjork matter: she is feeling all the joy and pain and daydreaming, saying all those words, singing all those songs, and dancing along to the music she so ingeniously composed. Lars von Trier once again wrote and delivered a 100% powerful film. He packs all kinds of emotions into 2 hrs. and 20 mins.: from the endearing friendship of two working women Kathy and Selma; to the faithful loving pursuit of Jeff for Selma; to the quiet exchanges of seemingly trusting souls of Bill and Selma; to Selma's son, Bill's wife, the crime, the court, the prison's loneliness within; the anguish pain of a determined mother; and the integrated mood changing musical numbers in-between. One scene of Bjork lying motionless with just one finger moving with quiet sobbing heard is powerful imagery.Catherine Deneuve as Kathy is well at ease in her supporting role. She continues to exude her charm quietly. You can tell she thoroughly enjoys the company she's in at this production. Musical-wise, Deneuve is no stranger: besides ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" 1964 - every word in the film was sung, I also remember Jacques Demy's ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" 1967 - she danced and sang with her sister Francoise Dorleac, along with Gene Kelly, Michel Piccoli and George Chakiris.David Morse as Bill (the policeman and neighbor) reminds me of what a memorable performance he delivered in Sean Penn's ""The Crossing Guard"" 1995 opposite Jack Nicholson and Robin Wright. 'tis great to see Joel Grey dancing again (hm, in the most improbable setting!)For a 5' 4'' singer-songwriter from Iceland, Bjork is a giant impact in this quiet powerhouse of a film, ""Dancer In the Dark."" Lars von Trier's vision and confidence in Bjork truly paid off!"
"When I was driving to see this movie, I wondered how I was going to react to the film. Lars Von Trier had always been one of my favorite directors, but I was unsure if I was going to enjoy this film. After watching the film, I half to say that this was one of the best films I had ever seen. Lars von Trier used handheld cinematography perfectly and I was especially impressed by how he operated the camera himself. Also the way he used lighting and still cameras in the music sequences expressed the surreal daydreams of Selma.Selma, played by Bjork, is a strong willed yet kind character who is hit by a series of bad events. Bjork plays this role so convincingly it is almost uncomfortable to watch. She doesnt act more than emote the character.With Lars Von Trier directing and great acting, this is far and away the best film of the year. Its unfortunate that America didn't give the recognition the film deserved."
"This felt so real. When I watch films these days, I am always watching them with a critical eye for technicality or acting. This film brought me into it's world, the magical world of bjork. Even the musical parts drew me in, because they were so oddly out of place.I've seen people complaining about Bjork's acting... I honestly haven't felt this emotional over an actors performance in years. And I've seen hundreds of movies this year alone. She made me fall in love, She was innocent, destroyed by the greed of human nature. Honestly, All technical problems aside. I mean the grain was awful, It looks like it was shot with a mini dv camera, and Von trier probably should have hired a camera operator.This was easily one of my top 10 films I've seen this year."
"Gene Kelly's musicals may never have tempted a tear, but this film sure did. This is the most creative and powerful film I've seen this year. I just got back so it will take a while to absorb where it fits in the hierarchy of great movies, but it is one of the few 10's I have ever given on IMDB. I went in knowing nothing other then that Bjork was the lead and that it was a Cannes favorite, I and was rewarded greatly. I am not closed minded, but I thought I would never again find a musical that so wrapped you up in the emotional core of the piece, such as the musicals that I enjoyed in my youth. Its style is experimental enough that I would be surprised if it got a Best Film Oscar nod, but never would I be surprised for any honors bestowed on Bjork, who torturingly WAS Selma for those two painful hours. She is a goddess."
"Dancer in the Dark haunted me. This film was an amazing view into the human mind as well as a tragic story of hopeless hope, betrayal by others, and still remaining true to yourself. Bjork produces an inspirational performance, of which one would never think she is not primarily an actress. Some of her moments in this film bring you to tears with their absolute honesty. The ensemble cast are a godsend as well. Peter Stormare, Catherine Denevue, and David Morse in particular. Morse, playing the most varied and difficult character, succeeds with apparent ease. The only complaint I had of the film is that it was slightly drawn out and slow paced. However, it is still spiked with moments of surprise that knock you so hard, you are pulled back in immediately. With an incredible closeness to these people, Dancer in the Dark will make you think and stretch your emotions to the limit."
"As a fan of Lars Von Trier's earlier works, as well as Bjork's music videos, I was quite excited to see a collaboration between the two.  I tried not to expect much, however, as many reviews of the film were quite poor.  I couldn't have been more delighted by the film.  Bjork's acting ability was superb (it is a shame she will not be acting in the future), and Lars Von Trier's writing and direction proved to be intense and incredible.  While he played with different themes in the genres of the Musical, the Neo-Realist film, and the Melodrama, he created a meta film, investigating human nature as well as the nature of film (or digital video) itself.  An incredibly emotional film, it also proved to be poignantly intellectual."
"I'm one of the so far 3000+ people to give it a 10, why?  Because of the misanthropic misers (500) who have given this film a 1/10.  A score that should be retained for use against such evil creations as ""Titanic"" and the plethora of TV Movies smacking you upside the head with their blunt educational themes (if you're lucky).  How, and I'm pointing fingers, a person could possibly detest this film to such an extent - to be filled with such revulsion - to grade it a 1 when all around the world a hundred thousand hours of TV is flooding through your little goggle boxes eating into your days and wasting your brains - hah, but you'll happily sit and watch that.To me this was as finely crafted piece of work as you could wish for.  It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, there are no flashy soft tone film effects or colour responsive film to make it all look glitzy and flash - the camera work does its job.  Maybe it could have been different, maybe the camera could have been held steadier.  Perhaps it could have stayed in one position and filmed everything from one spot - but it doesn't and that's the Directors privelege.  So to criticise his choice is fair enough.  I don't much mind if you batter his reputation to death with your hatred for his work, just don't twist the elements of the film to suit your purposes.Realistic?  I didn't realise it needed to be in order to explore emotions, nobility of thought and deed.  Who are we to judge the desperation of a womans love for her child?  To want her child to see the same musicals and love them as she did and continue to love them into old age without the fear of losing the ability to see their spectacle.  Two deaths worth one persons eyesight.....that's called sacrifice, the Director could have let her live - nobody could have died and the boy have his eyesight saved ""wahey!"" now what?  What would this film be worth?  What would we learn or find in ourselves if it all turned out nice again?  How many movies do you need to watch where the final credits scroll up over the image of a hugging mother and child before you'll let a single ""miserable"" ending pass before your eyes without instantly leaping out of your seat in outrage?Selma needs to be destroyed, she ultimately is there to be sacrificed and I think I would be right in saying that enough parents swear they would sacrifice themselves for their child - well, here's your chance.  You have the opportunity to give your child a life beyond compare in a world of opportunity; it may well be a world in which Selma herself can never adjust for her expectation of America is a purely Musical based one (and as such the Director provides you with a 'reality' - those streets aren't pathed with gold and the USA isn't the only land of opportunity and was the death of many, many hopeful immigrants), with your opportunity in hand would you not take it?  Are we really that shallow as to say ""yeah I'd do anything for you, except that, oh and that, and that, and that, and that, oh and that - and lets not forget that too"" when it's your progeny on the line?  I'm sure your ancestors are very happy to know that the sacrifices they made are being looked upon from afar with sanitised rose tinted spectacles.Sometimes you have to fight for your principles, sometimes you have to die for them.  Selma is a martyr, her songs are her hymns and the musicals are her religion and the stage her church - but in the real world she is isolated and her childlike 3rd innocence (how many tales do you need to read about the wonder of seeing the Statue of Liberty as the Immigrants sailed in?) is slowly compacted in by the reality, her only escape is her art.  Her singing, her religion and her child.  Her musicals are taken from her, she pines for them in the jail cell and she has already lost what little sight she had so the spectacle of them is gone also....all that is left for her is her child and affording him the best opportunity to have a full life.Maybe the film isn't perfect, but it isn't a 1."
"Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  But with a movie like DANCER IN THE DARK, it's very easy to get the sense that those who didn't like it are simple-minded sour-pusses with artistic tunnel vision.Plus, most people who hated it don't take the time to write a comment.  Why waste another second of your life on this dreck?I'd like to congratulate everyone who has the guts to trash this film.  It is not entertaining.  It is founded on characters who make ridiculous decisions to facilitate melodramatic story points.  It plays to the weaknesses of every one of its participants.Some of the comments can be paraphrased like this:  ""I like a film that causes such intense reactions, good and bad.""  If a film isn't good, why in the world would we indulge the amateur auteurs who created it?  This means Lars Von Trier will be encouraged to make MORE horrible films!Being forced to watch Bjork act is like being forced to listen to Anna Nicole Smith play the saxaphone.  Why can't we let people who were trained to act do their job?  Bjork vacillates between a caricature of her weird childish stage persona and a poster-child for OverActing 101 (especially the prison scenes).Selma, as a character, is by turns stubborn, stupid, unreasonable and selfish.  Not a very good candidate for a martyr.  David Morse's Bill, the antagonist, goes from benevolent protector to psychopath on the thinnest of motivations.  Peter Stormare practically drools to show how stupid he is when he is wooing Bjork.  It's a condescending repulsive love story.Part of me wants to not submit this comment, because in the end, the film isn't worth this much thought.  But if everyone thought this way, the comments would be overwhelmingly positive.  And I can't believe that that is representative of the audience reaction to this film.Unless you have a high tolerance for arthouse highbrow crap, don't see this movie.  It's a waste of your time.1/10"
"Björk gave to the cinema one of the most beautiful and well made performance ever... When I saw it first time, probably I stayed in so state of chock, that I don't remember what I thought about the movie itself, maybe I was so impressed about all the magnificence and fullness... This movie has everything what it needs: excellent cast & director, superb script and probably It has the best soundtrack ever. I can't really say if it has what is need in a movie for being nominated to the Academy Awards, but I know that, surely, It might have reached some!!! But the prizes aren't always what counts most, But the message that the whole is for the viewer... I just know that, after all, this superb story caused a multitude of feelings within me: pain, crying, joy, despair, afraid and shame. Is unbelievable, isn't it?! One of the most powerful films of the whole history of cinema. A motivational 10 out of 10!"
"aw·ful ... adj. 1. a 2 hour ""musical"" without a second of decent music for the first 56 minutes, and then the male lead looks and sounds like Herman Munster. Then another 20 minutes before the next mediocre music & once again, the male lead sings worse than I do, and I sing awful. 2. a cameraman with ADD, and nobody bothered to fire him 3. in an emotional peak in a film, somebody gets shot and they say ""You shot me."" 4. a movie by a color-blind director about a going-blind, annoying non-actress 5. every ""tragedy"" that relies on every person in the tragedy acting like they have an IQ in the teens to create the tragic events 6. the intellectual highlight of the film, a prosecutor says ""the most well-planned murder in memory"", about walking into someone's house, saying Hi to his wife, & then going upstaris & shooting the husband 7. 141 minutes of Bjork"
"It makes me happy that people walked in the cinema theaters to see another kind of movie, another kind of musical and it makes me sad that the rest of the people didn't even have a thought of seeing this film. It makes me sad that some people walked out of the cinema theater at the beginning of the movie, thinking they paid money to see this movie and it makes me happy that the bags of popcorn remain untouched until after the end of the movie and the final credits. ...and it makes me happy that people shed a tear, impressed by the story of lars von trier's movie and the by one of the greatest performance in history...bjork's performance"
"A lot of the comments here are full of exaggerated praise for this film. And most of those comments are coming from people who are fans of the singer Bjork.  But if, like me, you think Bjork is completely weird and her music is awful, then read the rest of this review, because this will be your fair warning about the film ""Dancer in the Dark"".""Dancer in the Dark"" is from Danish director Lars von Trier and may be the most unwatchable film of the past few years.  It stars Bjork in an over-praised performance, because she really doesn't have a screen presence at all and is overshadowed by any one of her co-stars (i.e. people who actually can act) in any scenes  in which they are together.  Bjork plays a character who may be the most pathetic character in film history and who's foolishness leads to her fate in a depressing plot, which is both ludicrous and manipulative as it leads to an unrealistic outcome that only a sadistic screenwriter and director could force-feed to an audience.  As for filmmaking, the movie is shot in a shaky-camera style reminiscent of bad home movies and absolutely guaranteed to promote nausea.  This shaky-camera look that dominates the movie, though, is occasionally broken up by colorful fantasy musical numbers, which have two major flaws: (1) they are not staged very well, and (2) they contain Bjork's music (which, as I said earlier, is pretty awful).Some claim this movie broke new ground.  If having a completely pathetic lead character, bad musical numbers, a ridiculously contrived and depressing plot, nausea-inducing camera work, and lacking any entertainment value whatsoever is new ground, then yes, this movie does break new ground.  It's also completely unwatchable, but there are a lot of unwatchable movies, so it wasn't breaking any new ground in that regard.** You have been WARNED.  Now watch, if you must, at your own risk **"
"Seriously, a 7.8 on IMDb? My wife and I got roped into this from a fairly interesting summary: A woman losing her sight turns her reality into musical numbers as her life spins out of control. Little did we know that every single awful thing that happens to her is because of her own stupidity.Actually, I can't blame the character - I think she was losing her mind along with her sight (it's the only explanation for her moronic behavior) - but I sure as heck blame the director. NO ONE acts like this Bjork character. Covering up for the guy who stole your kids eye surgery money because he made you promise not to tell anyone about his money problems? Even when you are on trial for his murder? Even when he begged you to kill him because he's a scum who steals from a blind woman? PREPOSTEROUS. I would've made the leap of illogic if she would've sprouting wings and flew into the air. But this? Come on! This has to be one of the most insulting movies to the intelligence of film audiences everywhere. All that was lacking from the forced emotional suffering of this character was having her dog get run over by a car because she forgot to put on the hand-brake or something. There was no dog but I really don't know why the director didn't throw that cheap-shot in as well. Something to do with Animal Cruelty laws in Europe or something? It's the only explanation.Blech, I just had to vent something about this awful film but I refuse to go deeper. I think a quick scan of some other comments will provide you with a body of evidence to avoid this one. The one star reviews are the only legitimate entertainment you'll get out of this disaster."
"So many people have written that this was a difficult film to watch and I'd have to agree, since it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I really was intrigued about the movie since it appeared on so many top ten lists.  I was completely disappointed.  Inane does not begin to describe the scenes where she just breaks out into song. It was laughable. Yeah --I get it -- she lives in her own fantasy world -- I figured that out after the first musical number.  Do I have to be inflicted with the same gimmick throughout the whole thing?  A profoundly stupid film."
"It must be the climate or something. Why is it Scandinavians have such a penchant for making the most depressing films in the most tedious manner? I'm a very tolerant movie watcher, American or foreign. A film has to go out of its way to get me not to at least accept it. So naturally, I got sucked in by all the wonderful reviews this has received. I watched two ""downer"" movies this weekend -- ""Dancer"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" so it's not depression I'm put off by. But at least ""Requiem"" was somewhat interesting. ""Dancer"" was a pretentious crashing bore, and the choreography was downright stupid. The shaky ""nervous"" camera technique is nothing new. It was one of the reasons I could never stand to watch NYPD Blue. My wife, smarter than I, left the room halfway through. I let von Trier drag me at a slow crawl to the bitter end -- an end I was anticipating with relish before it arrived -- and not just the end of the movie, but the very specific end of Selma, the most satisfying scene in the movie."
"Sophomoric profundities. And what are they?--Dogma about verity and the omniscience of the camera. Done much better with 'The Limey,' in terms of the faceted eye. And mined as a subject itself in ""Snake Eyes.""--Self-reference about people in the film imagining that they are in a film. Done so much better in dozens of films -- the ones that come immediately to mind are the ambitiously conceived 'Nurse Betty,' the truly cinematic 'Sex, Lies and Videotape,' even the glossy-arty 'American Beauty.'--The tragic grind of fate. Done better (plus self-reference to film studies) in the recent 'Hamlet,' the one with Hawke and Stiles.The songs did not work for me, did not transport. And that's strange since this is supposed to be deeply welling from the visual.But it is not very visual. Think how much better the effect of 'Drowning by Numbers' was.Bjork DID work for me. The strongest criticism I have heard of her performance was they she was fey. Yes, and damning too, but that's all right with me in this case because she is risking her soul. And that is something one can't avoid watching. What is truly interesting is the self-referential nature of her performance. She (Bjork) is only effective because she imagines herself to be in a movie.A final comment, which I am surprised to not have seen before. It may be difficult for a Scandinavian to appreciate, but one cannot do a piece about tragedy in the US, a piece about sweatshop factory labor in the 50's, a piece about the penal system, without including blacks. There are essentially none here, minus one (two?) of the Danish dancers. (The friend was supposed to be black, and I suppose we are better off without a completely artificial character.)The DVD documentary on the choreographing is much more 'dogma' than the film itself."
"First, the defensive comments.  I *love* Bjork.  I *love* great filmmaking. I was hoping this movie would be a story wrapped around some ""Oh So Quiet"" type music/dance numbers.But I think this movie is horrible!  I'm not even concerned with the style of filming, which isn't my cup of tea, but has it's moments.  The plot was full of strange holes, and the characters were horrible.First off, I'm pretty sure Selma was only supposed to be going blind, not mentally impaired.  I'm sure some of that is Bjork's acting style, but Selma came across as dumb more than anything else.  Maybe there was something in the air in the town, because just about all the other ""characters"" (if you can call them that) seemed equally mentally impaired.(Spoiler Alert)Also, how in the world did Selma's friends end up with her money?  The state doesn't just give these things back to you after a trial, even if people are telling them that you're just trying to help your son.And, the singing/dance parts did *nothing* for me!I can't believe how many positive reviews this movie got.  I was all excited when I saw the DVD at the local video store this weekend, and was extremely let down by the first 45 minutes in."
"Blind woman allows herself and her 10-year-old son to suffer unnecessarily because she is too ""noble"" to ask for any help -- or accept it when it is offered.  She is so ""noble"" that when she fantasizes the fantasies are as harsh and bleak as her everyday life.  This broad has no imagination, not to mention common sense.  (I'll skip the part about her role as Maria in the ""Sound of Music"" because it's just too ridiculous to go into.) She refuses a ride home and almost gets hit by a truck.  She is warned not to daydream at her drudge of a factory job because she could ruin expensive machinery if she doesn't pay attention, so she daydreams and ruins the machine, thereby cutting off her only supply of money, which she was socking away to pay for an eye operation for her son, who will go blind if he doesn't get one before age 11 or so. Let's see, oh yeah, the friend she rents a trailer from (he's a cop!) spies on her to see where she hides the money and steals it because he can't bear to tell his wife to stop spending money because if he does she might leave him (what she spends the money on remains a mystery because they also live in a hovel.) But this supposedly makes him suicidal but can't kill himself so he begs our girl to when she comes after her hard-earned money. In a really contrived and artificial scene, she winds up shooting him and then bashing in his head for good measure --is arrested, convicted and hanged.  As Porky used to say...that's all folks."
"I'm going to tell it to you straight.  This movie sucked.  It was too long, not interesting, and slow as hell.  I blame the director for everything. And I blame ""arthouse"" people for raving about this awful excuse for a movie.  How could anyone like anything about this movie?  It was horrible! I like a good character drama as much as the next guy, but this was bad. Someone else said that it should have been edited more.  I totally agree. W@e fast forwarded through the first hour, and still struggled to watch the rest of the film.  Let me put it this way:  whenever there was a room full of people, I'd put the movie on and the room would clear out in a matter of minutes.  Bjork was okay, but there was just no good story.  Here's one for you, ITS BEEN DONE BEFORE!!!!  I do love the soundtrack though... to bad the songs are different in the movie.  I would advise everyone to steer clear of this bad movie."
"I really did. How can people find this emotional and sad?Awesome directing by Von Trier, and very nice actors (except Bjork, she ruins the entire movie. I heard she never wants to act again, and i'm very happy!), but the story just seems stupid to me and it has been forced too much to be a sad tale.There's only one that really got to me: (SPOILER!!!!!!) when Midget shoots the police officer, and then she smacks in his head with an iron box, an then... THE GUY STANDS UP AND STARTS SINGING A SONG WITH HER!! I just laughed my ass off, but I doubted it was meant that way."
"I have to say that every once in a while, there are films that come out of the screen to become experiences by their own. These are the kind of films that give us a breathe of hope: there's still people who think of movies as art and not dollars.Since the very beginning you feel next to Selma and her beautiful intentions, you live the innocence of a heavenly woman surrounded by a world that seems to be destined for her as a strike of pain. It's heartbreaking without being effectist, it touches a part of us that needs to be shaken sometimes.In the technical aspects, it's ""dogma"" enough to make you feel part of the story and understand the spectacular musical sequences as the dream we can all escape to. A beautiful achievement. And I won't forget Björk's flawless performance, I had never seen an actor actually becoming the character the way she pulled it off, making her singing the strongest weapon to feel and make us feel.I have heard some hateful comments about it. It's like life: you must be willing to live it and love it for what it is, or you can turn your eyes away and escape from tears. When I left the theater I knew I hadn't only seen a brilliant piece of art, but also I had lived emotionally...that's everything I hope to get from a movie and much, much more. I'm not afraid of the word...a masterpiece."
"This is my favorite movie from the brilliant director Lars von Trier. I did not only watch the movie with my eyes, I felt it in every corner of my heart. It was so powerful, that every time I think of the movie, I remember the feelings I had when I first watched it. It is one of those rare movies that will follow you through your entire life. And I appreciate this."
"For some, ""Dancer in the Dark"" is viewed as one of the greatest films of all time, but for others, it's viewed as a melodramatic, pretentious mess. The film stars Björk as Selma-a Czech immigrant who suffers from a (unnamed) disease which is gradually causing her to go blind. She saves her money for an operation to prevent her son from going blind. The plot has been criticised for being overtly melodramatic and formulaic. The plot of ""Dancer in the Dark"" isn't anything exciting or original, but it works. ""Dancer in the Dark"" is a musical, though it hardly feels like one. ""Dancer in the Dark"" is a gut-wrenching, but not overtly sentimental tearjerker in which Björk completely immerses herself in her role as the natural and innocent Selma. Also, worth mentioning are the performances of Catherine Deneuve as Selma's best friend Kathy and Peter Stormare as her shy neighbor Jeff. I admired the simplicity of this film adherring the some of the rules of Dogme 95, a film movement created by von Trier (Dancer in the Dark's director) which aimed to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology in the hope that the industry would give the power back to the artist as opposed to the studio. ""Dancer in the Dark"" works as both a homage to the musical genre and as a tearjerker, if not a little melodramatic. 8/10"
"The joy of musicals is that they're so jovial and exaggerated that they counterbalance cold hard reality and offer audiences a happy form of escapism. Dancer int he Dark somehow does the opposite; it immerses the audience in the tragedy of the characters, until it finally punches you in the gut and leaves you crying on the ground.This is a long film, but it is pretty briskly-cut so that no scene outstays its welcome. There are just a few musical numbers, but they aren't necessarily the same kind of flamboyancy you see in The Sound of Music or anything. If anything, the sequences in this film are downbeat and perhaps a little awkward. I don't think this film stands out as a great musical, but it does stand out as a great drama, because the film's sole focus is on story and character.The musical aspect of the film provides a stark contrast between the main character's daydreaming and the harsh reality she has to face. Ultimately, it is the drama of Selma Jeková that takes the spotlight and makes the film so invoking; the film builds her up in a way that we don't want to see anything bad happen to her. Inevitably, the story gradually unfolds until desperation and hard times forces neighbors to betray one another, and the last half of the film leads to a hard-hitting finale. The last scene is among one of the most depressing endings I've seen. One could complain about the story - it does have some contrivances and manipulation - and chances are that some folks won't care for how things play out. I believe that it is an interesting plot that's laden with strong themes concerning dreams (both personal and the American dream), and the film's play on real-looking drama and musical fantasy makes it feel even more punchy.Inspired by the Dogme 95' style, this film is crafted with a lot of hand-held camera work, blunt editing, and dull color schemes, giving it a pseudo-documentary look and feel. Musical sequences contrast greatly, using still camera work and a music-video style of editing, and more color. Acting isn't bad; the singer Björk is surprisingly a perfect fit for Selma's character, giving her a life and personality we can't help but to sympathize with. Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, and Peter Stormare are earnest in their roles. Writing isn't too subtle or sophisticated, but it matches up well with the performances and the film's style. Björk's music ranges from snazzy to hauntingly ambient, and the same extends to the music she made for this film; it is especially interesting how the background beats are made to match up with the sound effects of a given scene. The final song used in the overture, end credits, and last scene might be the most beautiful one I've heard her sing.Dancer in the Dark is a bit like Breaking The Waves; both are gut-wrenching stories of women with golden hearts who become victims of unfortunate circumstances. I give Dancer in the Dark the edge for using entwining the genre of musicals with the drama to give it contrast and weight. I believe it is a storytelling experience that everybody should try out at least once.4.5/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"This is one of the first art-house (not sure if it is classified as one by critics or not) films I've seen. I've watched it 12 years ago and now after being more mature, watching more than +100 films... still find it one of the best drama-musicals ever made. It still has the same effect on me, compelling, powerful and just captivating. One of the films you watch without being (or not wanting to be) disrupted by phone calls, reading or talking to someone else. Arguably, predominantly women have resembling feelings towards Björk's Selma than men, hence all the negative comments from more ""rational"" counterparts. However, I might be wrong. Just read a few lines written by men, that are reasonable at times, yet quite relentless..."
"Salute to the director for having given the audience such a great drama. The camera wobbles every other scene (Dogma camera) which adds reality to the screenplay and makes the movie itself dance to the musical. Bjork was great with her songs and acting skills.Happiness is the state of mind, I believe.In this movie Bjork day dreams it with her music and dancing.The way she takes beat from the factory machines and the moving train are way too good. In a musical movie,nothing dreadful happens, but it isn't true in this movie. A tear jerking drama. The climax leaves the viewers emotionally draining thinking about the poor kid with no one possibly to look after."
"A rose is a rose and fertilizer is fertilizer.If someone threw fertilizer on a canvas and swiped it around masterfully with a 6"" house painters brush it might be called art but it would still stink.  Artistic style is not style unless it endures the test of time. This film will fade along with all the forgotten efforts that are merely fashionable for their time.  Deviation for deviations sake does not constitute style and that is where I place Von Trier's work on Dancer in the Dark.  Contrary to many opinions, there is absolutely nothing honest or realistic about this film.  The so-called stylistic camera work is simply amateurish at best.  The acclaimed voyeur sound and lighting is actually muddy and cliche.  The acting is particularly bad considering the wealth of talent that was employed.  I must attribute this to poor scripting and a blatant lack of direction.  I've seen better acting and direction in a B grade 1950's science fiction movie.  The surrealism invoked by the musical daydreams is so ridiculous and misplaced that I'm sure if any of the forefathers of surrealism were alive, they would sue. The story line is completely without merit.  There is no redeeming quality in the main character as many are led to believe.  The sacrifice that is alluded to is no sacrifice at all.  It is merely a blatant act of stupidity followed by a complete abandonment of friends and legal prowess. Unbelievable in every sense of any investigation or legal defense for a murder case.  How could any truly loving parent get talked into such a path of destruction and perform such an idiotic act is beyond me. Viewers that are blinded by the directors manipulation of the emotions should step back and consider the child.  Ok, he can see now; does that replace the need for a caring and nurturing parent.  I hardly think so.The end sequence is paralyzingly rank.  The only compassion I could muster was for the institutions employees because they had to live with themselves after it was all over. That is truly pathetic.Basically, the only redeeming footage in the whole film is the 2 minutes of fabulous dancing by Joel Grey, too bad it didn't last the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes; I would have felt far more satisfied.John H. Freeman"
"Lovely, talented little singer Bjork plays lovely talented little singer Bjork in this pretentious and eventually ludicrous piece of nonsense.   I almost thought it had merit for a while until it lapsed into errant nonsense with sheer black and white cardboard characters, most of them treating poor little Bjork badly.  Singing pretty badly too.  I wonder why they never tied her to the railroad tracks: They missed a piece of high drama that would that would have fit nicely into the ""clever"" plotting of this film.Give the lady credit when she says she will never make another film. Bjork apparently knows that the emperor really does not have new clothes!"
"After getting rave reviews by the critics and winning awards at Cannes, I was expecting something dazzling. What I saw was a complete and utter waste of money. This is one of the worst films I have ever had to watch. The editing and continuity were dreadful, as for camera-work, my 6 year old daughter could have done better. The story line was disjointed and very difficult to follow. I can't comment on the individual acting performances because the terrible filming, editing etc were so distracting that I couldn't focus on the actors. One particular scene was so brutal that it was uncomfortable, but worst, it was totally unnecessary. I wish this site allowed negative votes because 'Dancer in the Dark' would have received -10 from me."
"Truth rarely lies in the middle.  Everyone who doesn't consider ""Dancer in the Dark"" a masterpiece considers it an abomination, so we can safely bet that it's one or the other.  And it's obvious enough which, if you ask me. Put your money on ""abomination"".Given it's so bad, why do some people love it so much?  Rarely has that question been so easy to answer: Björk has created an interesting character we truly care about, and the story is so beautifully tragic, so heartbreaking, it's hard not to fall in love.  The story, mind you, not the script.  Von Trier is not a master of construction, and his dialogue is mostly terrible.  It's still a fine story.Also, ""I've Seen It All"" is enchanting, as is the final song.There: that's EVERYTHING that's good.  You might think it would be enough. In the ordinary course of events you would be right; but von Trier contrives to ruin it all with his childish, theoretically-motivated clumsiness: the eye-watering textures of his digital images, his jiggling camera, his mindless editing - they all induce a headache.  True, after a while you stopped noticing.  So what?  Even when you aren't aware that you have a headache, you still have one, it's still pain, and it's still bad.  How could von Trier not be embarrassed to attach his name to such amateurish images?  The mere fact that this is an all-digital production - not a frame of film exposed - makes ""Dancer in the Dark"" something civilised people should shun, a bold gambit which, if it succeeds, will kill cinema altogether and leave us with just more television.  Not that the digital technology is even so much as half the problem, given the idiotic use von Trier puts it to.  One would have thought he'd have grown up by now.In general the songs - even the best of them - don't quite work.  Everything else in the film works against them.  Von Trier needs to edit less, to adopt a more flexible and visually meaningful form of presentation, to be less stingy with his music and insert more songs in the first half.  As it is the schlock-tv presentation of the rest of the film, the sheer musical silence, acts as a dissonance during the song and dance.  If this is deliberate it's a mistake.  If not it's still a mistake.  -Also, I have serious qualms about the lyrics of the ""you did what you had to do"" song.  I know the utilitarian baldness of the words was part of the point, but that kind of thing needs a kind of careful handling von Trier is reluctant to give anything.P.S.:  I've read that the film is set in the 1950s, or at any rate some time decades ago.  Well, maybe that's where von Trier INTENDED to set it, but if so he failed.  So far as I can tell the action takes place around now.  The setting certainly doesn't deserve to be called timeless, yet there's nothing to suggest the past: it's best thought of as contemporary."
"SPOILERS AHEAD This movie is so unremittingly ""TRAJ-EEK"" it is funny.  My friend and I went for coffee afterwards and wound up laughing so hard while dissecting it that we were crying! I'm afraid we made a bit of a scene, but hopefully the other coffee drinkers got the message to stay away from this one. One wonders why the filmmakers did not just send Selma (Bjork) straight to hell -- do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Apparently that is the only terrible fate she managed to escape in her short, unkempt, unbelievably harsh and unbearable life.  What really kills this movie -- I refuse to call it a flim -- is that nothing about it makes any sense. A near-blind, delusional young mother would rather let her and her 10-year-old son, a true innocent, suffer unnecessarily in silence than stoop to asking for and accept help from well-meaning co-workers.  She quickly goes blind from this hereditary disease that also affects her young son and because the United States offers a better life and medical care (except the neurotic director -- and I am being kind -- wouldn't take a plane to the USA for authentic locales so the movie was shot in Sweden, which throws the whole thing off kilter from the get-go.  You keep thinking, what the hell?  You don't even see a filling station, TV antenna, McDonalds -- nothing that would make it recognizably America -- and this is the early 1960s. A major distraction.) Selma and son wind up isolated in Sweden-America in the bleakest of circumstances. She works in a factory that looks like it is located behind the old Iron Curtain. She apparently thinks she is being noble by not accepting any help from anybody, including a perfectly nice man who is in love with her!!!! -- she refused a ride home from him and is almost run over by a truck.  She'd rather stumble along the railroad tracks to find her way home than accept this small favor.  For psychic relief, she fantasizes about Hollywood musicals (only her fantasies are as bleak as her real life, so how can they offer any escape?), deprives herself and her son of any amenities (she doesn't want the son to know he is destined to go blind) and pretends to send money home to her father while socking it away for her son's eye operation only to have it stolen, clumsily (and most artifically) kills the friend who stole the money, goes on trial, is convicted and hanged because she thinks it is nobler to be hanged than betray the friend who stole her money. Oh, how noble can you get.  And she won't see the son in jail, because she's too noble Bjork does a fantastic acting job.  It's just too bad she couldn't comb her hair at least once.  I can comb my hair with my eyes shut, for goodness sake.  That's it, folks.  If this is what you want in a flick, they be my guest.  At least you might get a good laugh out of it afterwards."
"Bloody awful would be a generous description of this film.The script was infuriatingly implausible. Most of the time I sat seething, wondering what sort of morons Lars von Trier takes his audience for. The only relief was when the songs started up. The music, like most of Björk's work, was innovative and enjoyable, but it was spoilt by von Trier's appalling lyrics. I'm surprised that Björk stooped so low.Do all Czech migrants in the USA speak English with an English/Icelandic accent? Who would have thought it?"
"I really loved Bjork's performance in this movie.  I didn't get all of the song sequences, however, (some were just completely bizarre) but I understand that this doesn't make the musical part of the movie bad just because some of us don't relate to it.  I loved the character they developed and really got into her troubles.  I found myself drawn to her strength and admired that.  I really liked the ""I've Seen it All"" song on the train too. This movie shows that Bjork is a one of a kind and creative genius.One thing about the movie that bothered me was the constant camera motion. I am sure the director did this purposefully in order to achieve a more intimate look into the lives of the characters.  It almost seemed like a hand-held camera filmed the movie.  The only problem is that I just about regurgitated from the constant motion.  It is nauseating after awhile. Almost unbearable.(I reveal some of the movie here.  Stop reading if you are afraid to have important details know to you).My conflict here is that I really fell for the character and love the movie, but at the same time I think the plot line is just borderline stupid.  It is just COMPLETELY unbelievable.  Bjork's character is going blind and her son has the same disease.  She saves money for an operation and things are going great.  Then the director introduces the tragedy and suddenly she is on death row awaiting execution.  And why?  Why?  Because she must keep a man's secret.  And this isn't a secret of monumental importance either. The secret is that his inheritance ran out.  God forbid we let this terrible truth get out.  It could mean the end of us all!  Then she refuses to let her friend tell her son about his eye disease because he may worry and if he worries, then he can go blind and then he can't get an operation.  HELLO HONEY! WAKE UP BABY!  His mother is on DEATH ROW and refuses to speak to him!  This kids days of worrying have only begun.  The problems with this go on and on and on.The only way this whole thing makes any sense is if this is really a story about a simple, vulnerable, blind woman with a love of music who has a serious mental illness.  She can't tell the fantasy world from reality and is almost insane from this skewed view of life.  In the real world, however, this would be the very thing that would have saved her.Also the fact that she was convicted of overpowering a 6'4"" police officer with his own gun and bludgeoned him to death while being completely blind is insane.  I could go on for hours with the ridiculousness of this movie.  It almost looks like the writer created the first half of one story, then second half of another and just cramped them together.  It simply doesn't work.I think that the writer and director were so desperate to create a tragedy that they lost touch with reality and forgot to make the story BELIEVABLE. Check the movie out.  In spite of the fact that it is inane and stupid, it is also a really interesting and beautiful story."
"I've been reading comments on this movie and was very surprised to see so many good ones. To me, this is the worst of cinema: it's not a bad movie... it's a disgusting, revolting one. The performance of Bjork is great, and the songs she wrote for the movie are brilliant. Everything else made me want to scream. I felt like I was being an hostage of some sadistic director. I hate being manipulated, especially concerning my feelings, and that was what Lars Von Triers intended to do. No one in the world is so unlucky as Selma. She's slightly dumb, naive, poor, and almost blind. She raises her child alone. She works in a dangerous factory. She's betrayed. I think Lars Von Triers should have made her crippled too! Anyway, the worst comes in the end. A one hour long agony. Great. ""You're gonna cry, you miserable audience!!""I went to see this movie with some friends and I would have left the theater within 20 minutes had I been alone. But my friends loved that movie, and left the place with tears in their eyes. I was furious about the director, about my friends for liking it, and about myself for spending 6 dollars on that horror."
"they write a story that defies reasons; is tearful and horribly shallow, then they get a clever actress who makes you cry you eyes out.   this is a world-class soap for masochists void of every genuine motive and emotion in their life.   a work of art should make you feel you're a bit closer to truth when you leave the theater.  After this film, I felt hopelessly stupid. After this film, I couldn't listen to bjork any more."
"Here's von Trier again. Doing what he loves to do: Manipulating you into a story of love and sacrifice, that almost made me cry.Almost. 'Cause you've seen it all before when you have seen Trier's latest films.He did it in ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dogme 2 - the Idiots"". Gave us a glimpse of somebody ""good"" or perhaps ""pure"". ""Dancer"" is also said to be the last (thank God!) film in the trilogy titled ""Golden Heart"".But does the Trierloved characters posesses golden hearts? No - they are merely being silly, not to say stupid. They are all quite anoying, especially Selma (Björk) here in ""Dancer"".von Trier wants us to see that she is driven by love to her son. But I think she is rather driven by nothing at all, being so foolish as she is.We have seen it again and again. And now yet again. This time I hope they will give him the golden palms. Perhaps he then get's new inspiration...Björk is alright, David Morse and Cara Seymour are better. I really do not know what Catherine Deneuve is doing in this film, and it looks as if she doesn't know herself either. The rest of the cast are Swedes, Germans and Danes. And the story takes part in USA...He is a marvelous director. But I hope he would be looking for new - really new - material."
"I saw this movie as part of ECU's ""Butt-Numb-a-Thon Part Deux,"" a 24-hour movie marathon. And for the record, I actually do like Bjork, but MAN to me, this was top-to-bottom a perfect example of how to make an unwatchable movie. The performances were awful, the dialog tedious and laughable, the direction and patented shaky-cam camera work gave me a headache, the musical numbers and ""choreography"" painful to hear and watch. As a few other reviewers have said, it seems like every character in this movie behaves like a complete idiot, especially Bjork's character. This movie somehow defies the laws of time and space, because despite a running time of 140 minutes, it felt like it lasted about 5 hours.SPOILER ALERT***************** When Bjork's character was finally hung at the end, our audience actually cheered and applauded, because they knew it was finally over. Unbelievable."
"Godawful melodramatic abuse of the recurring Van Trier humorless sweet gull/idiot (or Lillian Gish, per Roger Ebert) archetype, AGAIN!
The production numbers are visually interesting, like BREAKING THE WAVES chapter headings, which underscores the absurdity of Van Trier, whose talent is strictly decorative, aiming for plain indecorous truth? At LEAST 60 minutes overlong? Ms. Deneuve is hilariously miscast as a Frenchly American working wench!!! Bjork IS Gishy enough, or TOO Gishy, &/but modern rural/suburban industrial American scene/milieu is so gravely misunderstood (or dishonestly portrayed?) that one must be a stone artsfop to even consider suspension of eyerolling?Even the sappiest Frank Capra movie (LOST HORIZON?) is less risibly romantic than ANY Van Trier film? DANCER IN THE DARK rings heavily false, saccharine jejune, politically simpleton, often just implausibly maudlin/grim? Which suggests the real trouble with this kind of art or worldview? Minus genuine humor plus sufficient empathy for others to bother to learn/depict their peculiar complexities, what? I dunno. Crippling inexorable inanity? Adolescent tragic drivel? Compassionate conservatism?Movie fable/allegory is not & need not be dead, but spouting doctrinaire stylistic dogma implies paying more attention to the harsh (& sometimes funny?) facts/details of the world outside?"
"I see that I am in the minority in my ""1 -- Perfectly Awful"" vote on ""Dancer in the Dark"".  That sure doesn't bother me!   Yes the film was different, adventurous, startling -- and perfectly awful!  For the first half-hour, or so, I found it at least intriguing.   Even the factory dance scene was OK. Then David Morse pulled his little crime and the slippery slope down hill began.I found myself wondering how long this thing would go on, plus saying to myself -- ""My God, are they going to have her sing on the gallows?   Dance at the end of a rope?"" I seem to recall a short-lived Bochco TV series called ""Cop Rocks"".   It was admittedly worse than this film, but it was first by several years.   Oh yes, a comment about the acting.   What acting?"
"Irritating wobbly camera moves and awkward jump cuts make this movie almost unwatchable. OK, the lame plot hurts too.For a while in the middle of the movie the camera steadies down, and only the painful plot is bothersome. But then the shakiness comes back. Perhaps the cameraman was drunk at the start of the movie, then he passed out during the blessedly stable middle of the movie, and then he regained consciousness and had the shakes in the latter portions of the movie. Or perhaps this was ""art."" The only thing that stops me from hacking into the IMDb system and giving this movie a negative number of stars is occasionally pleasant choreography. I am going to give this DVD to someone I don't like."
"Dancing within Trembling Imagery.""What is there to see?"" In this sentence, Selma, the protagonist of Dancer in the Dark, a movie by Lars Von Trier, almost attacks and aims to destroy the main core of Cinema itself. Ironically, what makes this movie so intense, breathtaking, and monumental is Von Trier's exquisite use of cinematography, color selection, and highly saturated DV cameras. Moreover, as an artistic whole, this movie is outstanding in its coherence, intensity of effect, and originality. Utterly, if viewed by a critical audience, this movie also achieves in depicting very complex symptomatic meanings.It is very particular the fact that Von Tried decided to depict Selma's ""musicals/reveries/ breaks from reality"" sequences utilizing highly saturated DV cameras. This aesthetic element produces a sense of confusion for the viewer whom, since the beginning of the movie, had been visually accustomed to the ""unsteady"" LOW-FI hand held DV camera perspective. Furthermore, the use of this perspective sets the audience right in the middle of the scene and, consequentially, the viewer feels fully accomplice to the exposition of the plot and story. For example, the first scene is set in a small theater and the camera is shooting Selma through the eyes of the spectators, of the producers of the play, and of the actors of the play themselves. Nether less, the audience feels, senses, and participates to the exposition of the plot objectively and intensively because there is no external music overlapping the action  the viewer is thus not guided by any external mood-setter but rather engaged in and challenged with the scrutiny of the acting itself. This factor alone could constitute why this movie is so attention grabbing, stimulating, and viewer worthy. Furthermore, the camera often captures the reaction of certain characters in response to a specific situation rather than the subject itself. In the court scene, for example, when the judge verdicts Selma to death, the camera immediately zooms and focuses on Kathy's shock and then slowly scrolls towards other characters. This use of cinematography leads the audience in understanding the relationship between Kathy and Selma and how that relationship is in contrast with that one between Selma and the other characters. Without a doubt, this technique stresses in analyzing tension and psychological evaluation of the characters rather than the action itself. Dancer in the Dark, indeed, not only (somehow) follows the Hollywood three-act structure but is also a beautiful example of European character driven film  where the examination of a characters' existential circumstance is much more important than the development of the story itself or, at least, where the action or development in the story is marginal and has the only purpose to consolidate a socio- political or philosophical symptomatic meaning. Moreover, in Dancer in the Dark the audience not only feels sympathy (in the literal Greek etymological meaning) for Selma and for the complexity of her relationship with Kathy and Jeff but also for Kathy and Jeff themselves because they are all intricate characters who contribute as a whole in describing detail fully the situation and thus help the audience in discovering and in unfolding the main themes. For instance, throughout the movie Jeff is depicted as a simple and static character. However, Jeff was the function of the two most intense and memorable scenes: the train scene and the phone conversation in jail. During the phone conversation in jail, Jeff becomes a complex and dynamic (or rather utterly significant) character because he is the first one to put Selma in an immediate dreadful situation without having Selma escape in her dream world.During Selma's reveries the aesthetic presentation of the movie changes completely: All of a sudden, the audience is shattered in one hundred different angles of the shooting location and there beholds a mesmerizing and epileptic collage of brief shots which, for one second or less, photograph the movements, expressions, and voice of Selma in her dream- world. The use of ultra saturated colors, slow motion, and external music during the dream sequences, in contrast to the dry and cold exposition of the rest of the movie, is coherent within its context. As a matter of fact, when talking to the guard in jail, Selma declares: ""...in musicals everything is so beautiful (and) nothing dreadful ever happens"" In this scene, Selma explains how her archetype of relish is embodied in the aesthetic of Hollywood musicals. Perhaps, more than a Hollywood Musical, the dream sequences resemble the way contemporary music videos are shot  videos that are, in this specific cultural and historic circumstance, just as hectic and epileptic as Selma's reveries. Therefore, the audience does not undergo a sense of disruption throughout these scenes because Von Trier's aesthetic representation of such moments is expressed in a familiar language. Ultimately, this movie is about contrast of imagery: Selma's mesmerizing dreams are in contrast with the cold reality she faces, Selma carelessness for her status is in contrast with her struggles with giving Gene the operation from becoming blind himself, Selma's wonderful and ""movie-like"" conception of America (for her represented through the musicals) is in contrast with the way she is then treated by the American Jury and with Von Trier's portrayal of America as a materialistic, capitalistic, and anti communistic country.Fabio Brienza, a film student."
"I will be short. That movie got on my nerves as none before. I hardly could wait for it to finish. LARS VON TRIER has just tried to be eccentric and engaging, but was actually nothing more than boring and ridiculous. Bjork was pathetic. To be honest I have heard excellent comments about the movie from some of my friends, but to me it was just a waste of time."
"Von Trier's film is simply awful. It is supposedly a coda against the death penalty but exposes the fallacy of the ""Dogma"" style as it breaks several rules of this limited style that, if successful, shall destroy quality pictures as we have grown accustomed to since Thomas Edison shot ""The Sneeze"". SPOILER ALERT This film is beyond awful - one part spike Jonze video ""so quiet"" and one part Mentos commercial  - it is no wonder Bjork said she will never film another movie again. Bjork was competent in the role but you feel like cheering when she hangs. Yes, it is that bad. Abysmal failure. A testimony to the warped vision of directors who didn't have the will to film properly so they invented this joke ""Dogma""."
"Lars von Trier's main intent is shocking the audience while insulting them to the deepest possible level. His pretentious crap is art to the pseudo-intellectuals out there.  As with Breaking the Waves, the sole purpose of this movie is to see how much disgust can be stirred up in the viewer.  Not only that, but the film is slow, dull, and generally unwatchable.  I wanted to clap when it was finally over.1/10"
"Dancer In The Dark is easily one of the worst films I have ever sat through in my entire life.  I almost turned off the DVD player at least 4 or 5 times during the film, and in retrospect, I wish I would have. The story was so implausible, that it was impossible for me to have any feelings towards it's central character, played by Bjork, who I found to be somewhat capable at times, and at others totally ridiculous. I found the improvisational acting throughout the film to be very painful to watch most of the time and although I am a fan of Catherine Deneuve, her performance here is mediocre at best. I have to presume that the director intended the story to be as unbelievable as it was for a reason, but I fail to see what that reason is. I guess it is because traditionally, musicals have always been a bit lacking in the plot department, but I don't think this is a justifiable reason for this film. I applaud the director for his adventurousness in making this film, but ultimately, I think it is a dismal failure."
"This film was the first I saw from Lars von Trier. I think anyone can agree that he's a unique director- there's none other like him.This film has serious flaws, though; plenty of the songs, as I could remember, were unmemorable. As someone who has been raised on musicals, I found this somewhat disappointing. The shaky camera-work is enough to make one seasick. (I understand Lars von Trier likes hand-held, but this is ridiculous! (fortunately, that NEVER happens in his next film, ""Dogville"", which is nearly flawless and VERY well-done))However, the last 20 minutes, there's one thing I realized- nothing I considered negative in the previous two hours mattered. Just these golden last 20 minutes alone, everything changes. Bjork put her heart out into this performance, and it shows... perhaps a little too well. For only the second time, I cried during a movie. (the other one was ""Grave of the Fireflies"") Truly powerful stuff.Perhaps I should have watched my other rental (""The Truman Show"") afterward, instead of before.I haven't tried watching ""The Sound of Music"" (what I have considered to be possibly the happiest film of all time) after I had seen this; for some reason, I think I'd be bawling during ""My Favorite Things"".My rating: 9 out of 10."
"It hurts to give this movie such a low rating (5 out of 10) in some ways because it does have some things going for it--the performances of Catherine Deneuve, David Morse, Joel Grey, Peter Stormare, and some lovely songs, as well.  Most of all, Bjork is enchanting.  She has an undeniably powerful screen presence and her participation in the proceedings tempts one to overlook the movies manifold problems... ...but not so fast.  I must say that writer/director Lars von Trier's choice to shoot a musical in his grainy, home-video-like style (which worked well in ""Breaking The Waves"", it actually deepened that viewing experience) simply doesn't work.  It's a cinematic contradiction:  a documentary feel for something that is staged and choreographed.  Watching it, both sides of your brain never come together for a viewing experience that lets you suspend disbelief for very long.Furthermore, why aren't women a little outraged at this filmmaker?  I'm a guy, and watching this and ""Breaking The Waves"", I want to say to everyone who proclaims his brilliance, ""Wake up!  He's hiding chauvinism behind art."" Case in point:  the main characters of both those films are innocents who are helpless and childlike.  Both Bjork and Emily Watson redeem his decision somewhat, but his intentions seem too fuzzy.  It isn't that every female character has to be like Queen Elizabeth I or Oprah Winfrey, but must you keep on focusing on ones who are so weak and zero in on them with such strange fascination?I might not even gripe so much, but in addition to its other sins, this movie's way too long.  It drags.  And drags.  And drags.  I could feel my impatience with its arty pretentiousness compounding with every unnecessary minute (they number way into double digits).  Call it a classic or a brilliant work of art if you must, I just call it a movie that tries too hard and lands smack on its face."
"Why?  Because it's a one of a kind movie. The acting is superb (especially Bjork), direction assured and the musical numbers are great.  Still, it's the most depressing film I've ever seen.  By the end of the film I was crying practically non-stop.  It's so bleak I don't think I'll ever see it again, but it should be seen at least once by everybody.  It shows misery and suffering full throttle.  You'll either love it or loathe it (I'm somewhere in th middle), but you'll never see anything like it again and you won't forget it.  Just bring lots of Kleenex."
"Well this is possibly the most self absorbed piece of c**p I have ever seen. The plot is predictable, pedantic and preachy.  SPOILER ALERTI lost all total interest in Bjork's character, Selma, once she chooses to be hanged.  The motivation of the fact that Selma's best friend, Kathy, could only raise payment for an appeal by taking the money Selma saved for her son's operation is so coincidental.Selma's assertion that nothing bad ever happens in a musical should have seen West Side Story.The musical numbers are uninspired.  I left with the question about Bjork's performance.  Was this acting or is it, as I suspect, Bjork playing herself. Not worth the $9 I paid to see it."
"This movie was so bad I didn't even finish it. I can't even believe anyone voted for it. It was some of the worst acting i have ever seen with a storyline to match.Don't pay any money to watch this movie cause believe me, you won't even last until the end.This is my first review and was written to warn you of the horror of watching this movie.The only plus side is it will get the family out of the house.I hate musicals and this was by far the worst I have ever seen. This movie is definitely one of the worst ten movies ever made. Absolutely pure crap.1\10"
"I fell for the critical hype and rented the DVD awhile ago. I'm usually very forgiving of movies and find the good in them somewhere. This, however, is the most completely unwatchable movie I have ever wasted two hours on. Unlike other dull and boring movies that have left me dull and bored, by the time I finished watching this one I had reached the level of actively despising Bjork and von Trier and was rooting for Selma to meet her destiny sooner not later.Bad movie; atrocious musical. I guess it must be ART!"
"I'm an enormous fan of Lars Von Trier. I own ""Element of Crime"" and I also have great reverence for his thematically charged ""Breaking the Waves. ""Dogville,"" although slow moving and a bit forceful at moments, was still clever and effective. ""Dancer in the Dark"" is the worst I have seen from him. I guess it's fair to disclose that I'm not a Bjork fan. I think she has produced some OK songs in the past, but I don't care for her vocal style. She's decent with the Celtic influenced pop wailing routines, although not nearly as good as Sinead O'Connor, but since the songs written into ""Dancer in the Dark"" require more traditional Broadway style vocals, Bjork just can't do it. Her voice has no strength and her projection is poor. She's not singing from the diaphragm which shows very clear in the train scene by the frequency and depth of her breaths. I want to know why Lars Von Trier picked a modern Celtic singer to perform in a more or less traditional or Broadway style vocal role, with the exception of a couple of odd style scenes like the factory scene and so on. Even then, Bjork's vocal performance was very weak. To make matters worse the music itself was very poorly written. These song writers were of the belief that you can take a bunch of dialog and just say it in a melodic manner and suddenly it's beautiful music. Come on, even the earliest rappers know you have to have some rhythm and rhyme or else it's not going to sound good.***Attention Spoiler Below*** As a story it's forced and unrealistic. It's about a girl who is going blind but won't tell anyone even though she can barely walk on her own, a woman who is nominated to play the lead role in a theater production but has no singing or dance talent, a woman who tries to shield her son from any small hint of stress yet is quick to smack him if he skips school, a woman who has built a complete lie around her life to keep her son from knowing she's going blind, a man who will do anything for her even though she rejects him on a daily basis and shows no appreciation for him even when his life revolves around her, a man who is in severe debt but is able to get away with claiming he keeps a stack of 2056 dollars in ones, fives, and tens in his safe deposit box, and a correctional officer who is used to watching people executed but can't keep herself from developing a strong emotional attachment to the woman she has to execute. Well is about all that or is it really about a woman who is either retarded or has extreme psychological disorders? Incredible stories are good as long as the people in them don't act unbearably stupid. ***Attention Spoiler Above***Despite some major flaws the movie is not awful. Bjork's performance is good, probably because she's a misfit and she portrays a misfit in the film so she didn't have to really act much. Although, I did find the absence of tears in the movie ridiculous, because she's crying in about half the scenes -- would it have broken the budget to keep an eyedropper on the set? I don't think she in any way deserves an Oscar or even an Oscar nomination for this because it doesn't really show any sort of versatility. I would hate to try to see her play Ellen Ripley in Aliens or something. That would just be too excruciating to watch. I give this movie a 5 of 10....some of Lars Von Trier's other movies are so much better and this just doesn't stack up to a lot of the other movies done in the same style, for example, John Cassavette's films, Ingmar Bergman films, and other Von Trier films like ""Breaking the Waves."""
"Okay, admittedly, Bjork's acting was very impressive. But there were so many things wrong with this movie! The bad Czech accents would not have been quite as bad if they had matched one another, but instead, Bjork  stuck to her Icelandic accent (with a touch of British thrown in for some reason), making Catherine Deneuve's slightly better accent sound even worse. I thought the music would be one of the high points of the film, but the idea of the musical fantasy was wasted. There were 2 good songs, but when the other characters started attempting Bjork's distinctive vocal style they just sounded ridiculous because they couldn't pull it off. And the plot! Yikes! When Selma decided she would keep her secret from everyone and lied on the stand, I lost all sympathy for her, because she didn't even attempt to defend herself when she could have escaped the death penalty so easily by simply telling the truth. Also, helpful hint, never pick a famous person's name to use as an alias, even if they are only famous in Czechoslovakia. The courtroom scene was very unrealistic, as only the prosecuting attorney was allowed to speak. And when was the penal system that efficient with executions? In reality Selma would have been on death row for years, but in this movie her son is still a little boy when she is executed, and she has not aged at all. That doesn't even happen in Texas. Overall, this got 2 stars. It was only saved from ""awful"" by Bjork's acting, which couldn't make up for much in such a poorly written movie no matter how good it was."
"With ""Dancer in the Dark"" Lars von Trier confirms his tendency to cheat the audience by involving it in a cruel game. In this case the game consists in doing everything to make the viewer identify him/herself in Selma's character; so He shows her as the most harmless, excessively generous and implausibly naïve person in the world: a sort of a child-woman who hides her money in a cookies-box, someone which is impossible not to have sympathy for. Then He subjects Selma to a contrived series of physical and psychological tortures which, because of the identification process between character and viewer, is inflicted to the audience too. This way the director achieves his only aim: have the viewers crying after taking them on the verge of a nervous breakdown. One of the negative notes of this movie is the balance of characters: after ""Breaking the Waves"" Lars von Trier has been accused of misogyny and knowing that also The Dancer could be liable of the same remark, because of the very similar childish, tormented female main character, He surrounded Selma with a series of male characters who are almost all nasty and negative and He interspersed the script, especially toward the finale, with a lot of references to sorority and female bonding. For these reasons I invite IMDb commentators who claimed this film as a masterpiece to reconsider their judgment and think about it with more detachment: in fact the director's seemingly succeeded attempt was to talk only to viewer's heart cutting out the brain. Finally two requests: don't take The Dancer as film against death penalty and the American way of life because those issues here are merely functional to the heroine's martyrdom; but above all don't ever compare Lars von Trier to C.T. Dreyer: They don't have anything in common but the fact that They're both Danes and The Dancer resembles more to Arthur Hiller's ""Love Story"" than to ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". I give it 6/10 just for its technical merits and the indubitable effectiveness."
"First off, bjork is a very disturbed little girl. All anyone has to do is look her videos up on youtube to find that out (one involves licorice coming out of her nipples and wrapping her in a cocoon). But that's not the important right now. What IS important is that this movie is so amazingly sordid, it inspired me to create a mental list of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why is it bad, you ask? Well, like my fellow commenters, I think that the characters in this film have development and complexity rivaled only by puppets in children's' television programs. To call them two-dimensional is being generous. The entire film looks as if it's been shot with a camera phone. The intro to the film, containing what looks like stills of mentally handicapped children's' finger paintings (no offense to them) and the resulting mess of an exploded septic tank, is so amazingly tedious, it can only be interpreted as a warning sign of the film to come. The acting is so bad, it's not even laughable, the actors all have different accents that they're not even TRYING to hide, or maybe that's the characters, who knows? In a film like this, a place where everyone has a different accent isn't so strange. Furthermore, the loosely (and I mean LOOSELY) stitched-together plot is so scattered, you feel like you're flipping through channels rather than watching one cohesive thought. My friends and I decided to all watch it one night with the pure intent to make fun of it (in the style of Mystery Science Theatre 3000) but before we were 15 mins in, we drifted into conversation, leaving the movie playing in the background completely unwatched. That's how bad this film is, folks, you can't even stand to watch it TO MAKE FUN OF IT! I, like my fellow commenters, also relished the moment she was hung, in fact we fast-forwarded to that part and all burst into laughter when she died. I leave on this final note, this film won several independent film awards, and if I was an indie film maker, I'd be totally disgusted to win one of these awards if THIS is the caliber of film they commemorate."
"I have enjoyed some of the director's other films, but was sorely disappointed by this manipulative, self-indulgent ""musical"" (the first song is about 45 minutes in). Being a musical, of course, everyone bangs on about how much they love musicals, but I digress.Frankly, I am sick of characters hiding their life savings in shoe boxes, and them having them stolen to drive the plot forward. Why didn't Bjork move to a country that would do the operation for free, and has proper benefits for disabled people? Why was the court case such a travesty, with no attempt at balance shown? Are friends and family really allowed to rush from their seats to give things to people at an execution? Misery upon misery is piled upon Bjork for no reason at all.Ridiculous."
"Good directing, screenplay, and acting (except bjork, where she over-acted/mis-acted in several shots) but very poor and shallow plot.Basically you see this woman named Selma suffering in the whole movie and some of her friends tried to help her. Some parts are just basically stupid and childish for example why would that guard suddenly love selma so much it almost make it seem like a movie for children. And Selma is just selfish and stupid, she thinks some $2000 is more important than 2 human lives. If she really cared for her son then she should work something out with her friends. I doubt that her son would trade his mother for some surgeries.Besides did she really need that money in such a rush? Well she looks like 40 something when she completely lost her sight and her son is only like 6.Not only that, some of the ""musicals"" that are forced into the film are just overlong and hard to stand, not that i dont like bjork's music but i just dont think it fits in like that."
"Why discuss the plot of a movie, which is not a movie anyway. Dancer in the Dark is sheer emotion, and the movie can be described in one word: Björk.If you can stand seeing a person being tormented for more than two hours, you might not shed a tear. I was surprised to find that it was true, what Deneuvre had said, that Björk doesn't play Selma. She is Selma.Both Björk and her tormenter von Trier deserves all the credit they can get for showing, there is still new ground to break in cinema.If you want to see a movie, choose something else. If you want art, this is it."
"During the first ten minutes of this film, I was already disapointed. I thought the camcorder style screamed ""look at me! i just graduated art school!"" But after those first ten minutes, I got over it.This movie is so tragic, breathtaking, innocent, and depressing that I can't think of much to say about it. Bjork broke my heart as Selma. At times, the way she reacted to situations seemed too enthusiastic to be acting (in particular, when she and Bill are talking about musicals, when the tap dancers come out. Bjork should have won the oscar, or at least Ellen Burnstyn for ""Requiem for a Dream""...but no - Julia Roberts gets it ... HOW?)Peter Stormare was beautiful in a sad, sad way, and proved what an excellent actor he is. A lot of people have said the plot is unbelievable, or the musical numbers are laughable - don't you think that's the point? Stop trying to make one plus one equal two and tap into the emotions instead!!!"
"Contains SpoilersDancer in the Dark is one of the one of the deepest, best movies I have ever seen. It's unbelievable that an 11 year old girl like myself can appreciate a movie like this. I feel like I am the only one who gets the meaning of this movie. Well, first of all, the adorable Bjork makes a moving performance, and she sure as hell should have won an Oscar! I'm sorry, but just because Julia Roberts is America's sweetheart doesn't mean that she should win every award. Everything in this movie is so symbolic. the song the bjork sings at the end gets cut off by her death is because she never watched the end of musicals, because she hated how there was an end put to it, and she liked to think of musicals as never ending. and after she does get hanged, a curtain closes. That's because she was performing in a musical (her life) and the world was her stage. This movie is disturbing, but in a good way. I love this movie, and its one of my favorites, with my others, American Beauty and Being John Malkavich. I can't stop thinking about Dancer in the dark, and I saw it yesterday. Yes, this movie is that effective. I give it 14/10 and if you want to talk to me, email me ... i am dying to discuss this movie with someone else, whether you like it or hate it! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!"
"The story idea behind DANCER IN THE DARK is most interesting, unfortunately, the camera play overshadows all other aspects of this production.The hand-held camera endlessly jiggles from one person to another.  Except for the musical moments (which are very good), most of the movie is an amature-looking blur.  Motion sickness is the result.Also, except for the musical moments, the sound seems to be derived from a home video camera.  People at my work say yes, but the movie is so artsy.  I say yes, but the movie, ultimately, is unwatchable.  Sadly, a real dud."
"I ADORE Catherine Deneuve BUT.....  I cannot figure out for the life of me why she agreed to do this WEIRD film.  Bjork?  What can I say about the woman who dresses like a clown wherever she roams?  (Remember the Swan Dress??)  I hated this movie.  I bought it from Pay-Per-View and the good news is that I only paid $3.99.  Fortunately, I shut it off halfway through so as not to waste another minute of my time.  That said, the second half of the film may have some very redeeming qualities.  (It would have to have a lot of them, though!!)  But I will never know since wild horses could not drag me to see this movie again.  I will re-use the video tape for something else far more worthy of keeping."
"Truly, I believe that Von Trier scores purely on originality alone. The hand-held technique, the mix of Bjork's music with the rhythm of machines in a factory, etc. The whole thing falls apart at the two main turning points in the story: the murder of the cop, a complete manipulation that Bjork just couldn't explain her way out of . This strikes me as fake. The other being the courtroom scene leading to Bjork's sentencing. The prosecuting attorney acts like a completely soulless jerk out to ruin someone's life with accusations and the entire American judicial system is made to look like it's out to crush people with ""alternative"" views (communist) and outsiders. This all leads to the depressing and deceptive conclusion. I love Lars Von Trier but was sorely disappointed with the simplistic attack on the U.S. without the comment on the cruelty of human nature as a whole."
"I find it hard to say how exactly I feel about 'Dancer in the Dark'. I absolutely loved Bjork's performance; she pours her heart and soul into her character and makes you feel involved emotionally with Selma. Being a big fan of her music, I loved her singing in the film, too, although I found the staging and choreography of the musical numbers themselves rather shoddy. The supporting cast are all great as well, the sympathetic prison guard a standout for me.Much has been made of von Trier's camerawork, which is supposed to bring grit and ""realness"" to the film. I was never impressed with it personally: in my view, all films are ultimately fake and unreal, artificially constructed, so the hand-held camera or insistence on using natural light are ultimately just another techniques and gimmicks. They do end up making the film look very drab and washed-out, which I guess suits the overall depressing feel of it.And what a depressing story it is. Which in itself is not bad; I can think of many powerful works of film or literature with an extremely grim and nihilistic view of life. What disturbed me about ""Dancer in the Dark"" though is the impression that von Trier seems to savour the drawn-out suffering and destruction of Selma with some sick sadistic relish. The film doesn't even make an attempt to make Selma's tragic story plausible - she suffers purely because the director decided that she should. The courtroom scene in particular has got to be one of the phoniest and most ridiculous I've ever scene in film, with characters behaving in the way that makes no sense whatsoever. In fact the whole story is so melodramatic and in parts implausible that, had it been a mainstream Hollywood film without any ""arty"" veneer, it would have been sniggered and laughed at.That said, for all that I hated in the film, I can't deny that it definitely got under my skin. Which I guess von Trier wanted in the first place."
"If you had to pick only one movie to see this year, you would be extremely hard pressed to find a film more deserving of this honor than Dancer In The Dark. I never felt so deeply moved and yet uplifted at the same time. The only negative thing I can muster to say is ""How in the world could this work of art be missed by the Academy?"" Truly a great let-down. Winner at Cannes Film Festival for best picture and best actress proves that someone somewhere is giving credit where credit is due. Watch and enjoy what cinema could be like if..."
"I don't remember the last time I saw a more inept movie.  I am amazed I sat through it.  It was absolutely preposterous.  It looked like it was set at some time in the 50s.  The protagonist, a borderline retarded immigrant who is going blind from an unnamed hereditary disease, has been cast as the lead in a community theatre production of The Sound of Music even though she is absolutely talentless as an actress, singer or dancer.  She also works a full time job, does freelance work and cares for a son who has the same disease she has.  She has fantasies in which her life becomes a series of anachronistic MTV videos.  She ends up committing a brutal murder and being hanged by the state while her old friends watch in a kind of little theatre in which they get to witness the snapping of her spinal cord.  (To paraphrase one character:  ""Well, she said Communism was good, so she probably deserved it."")  Comic book dialogue combined with graphic violence, some inane song lyrics, some lively MTV dancing make for an uneasy mix.  I found Bjork a very unattractive performer.  I was sorry to see Catherine Deneuve and the great Swedish actor Peter Stormare in stupid roles in this stupid film.  (This is the second worst film I've seen this year.  I did at least sit through it.  I fled Love's Labour's Lost after 45 minutes.)  By the way, The Sound of Music opened on Broadway in November of 1959.  Amateur rights were not released until several years later.  It did not become an icon of mainstream culture until after the release of the 1965 film version."
"This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Nothing in it was good.  The camera work was bizarre, and the editing was even worse.  Every time the camera panned the picture went out of focus and this made the viewing audience (at least me) dizzy.The acting was poor and the plot was absurd.  The movie seems to be covering up its emptiness with an overly contrived and complex plot.The movie stars David Morse, one of our greatest modern actors, who is totally miscast and misused playing a caddish policeman.  The movie abounds with dream sequences which contribute nothing to the show, and resolves its sorry plot with a pointless death.That this movie has gotten high rating from its viewers is simply an example of the old ""the emperor has no clothing"" fairy tail.Don't waste your money on this trash!!!"
"I am shocked that this film has been so highly praised.  Over and above the filmmaking style (which seems to be deliberately `in your face' and begging to draw attention to itself), this film asks the audience to accept, over and over again, situations and actions that are just not believable.  It is a great tribute to the actors (including non-actor Bjork) who deliver wonderful performances, that they can act in situations that are so totally false on every level.  Without going into the many, many falsehoods on which this film builds its narrative, I will mention just one.  The core of the plot is a medical condition which is inherited and can be treated by an operation(?) that needs to be performed within a particular 2-week period of a person's life.  Is there anything even remotely like this in medicine? But worse are the numerous actions of the characters that just defy any honest human behavior.   It is a greater tragedy that this film so manipulates the audience with such fine performances.  Filmmaking like this should be a crime."
"Firstly let me say, I have a very open taste in films.  I love, small, arty, independent films, which is why I was expecting to like this.  But no, this is the only film I have ever been tempted to walk out of.  I tried to like it, I really did.  But no matter what angle I thought of, it still seemed terrible. It's not the acting that put me off, because this was quite good.  Bjork was natural and believable.  As too were the supporting cast.  It's more the whole concept that I had trouble with.  Grainy, bleak music free cinematography, mixed with a harrowing, emotion tugging story line, interspersed with jolly 1950's musical skits?  The pain of seeing good actors sing badly was more than I could take.  The first hour or so (it seemed like 5) dragged like a lead boot.  I kept thinking ""any second now, a song will kick in"", but it didn't.  When the songs did eventually arrive, they seemed so far out of place, as to destroy any empathy you'd built up for the charaters.  Even though Bjorks character was mousey and quiet and did nothing in particular for the whole film, she still managed to gain the total trust of people she'd only just met.  It just seemed all to contrived, as though it was trying to be thoughtful and arty. There are a thousand small independent films that are a thousand times better than this piece of tripe, that will never get the recognition of this film.  That has to be the biggest tragedy of all. Avoid at all costs!"
