"Okay, I am not from India, not even close. I am from Scandinavia. Before Lagaan I had never watched any Hindi movies of any kind. I know about 3 words from the hindi language. And I don't like musicals much. I viewed the movie on a DVD of rather poor quality compared to the state of the art DVDs I am used to. And I was told the movie lasted close to 4(!) hours... I figured this would be a complete waste of time... BOY was I wrong! This movie is completely the opposite! It is just amazing! Mr. Gowariker has selected an incredible cast with Aamir Khan in the lead. He makes an stunning performance as the village rebel, Bhuvan. He tries to unite the village in a struggle for life against the greedy Britons. The Britons exploit the villages by collecting lagaan (tax). This means that most of the harvest surplus is gone and there is just enough left for food for the farmers themselves. It's a classic war between ""David"", the native villagers of India, and ""Goliath"", the powerful and greedy Britons. But what makes it really interesting is that this war is fought in a Cricket arena. This is a challenge from the Britons, who are well known with Cricket, against the village, where most people have never laid eyes upon a cricket bat. If the villagers win, there will be no lagaan at all, for three years! And if the Britons win, they will collect triple lagaan, which will mean the end of the village.  The stakes could not be higher!!I can't remember a movie being this thrilling and having so much life in it. And the music has a huge impact thanks to the great voices of Udit Narayan, Lata Mangeshkar etc. And the dancing is a chapter in itself! Few or none will leave this movie not remembering the song ""Mitwa, sun Mitwa"". It is a must see for everyone, inside and outside of India. And this movies has been totally righteously nominated for an Oscar too, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes all the way to the top. It has my vote! It gets 10 out of 10 from me. Excellent!"
"The setting is historical The year is 1893 The British Raj imposes heavy taxes on the poor villagers despite all the problems droughts have caused on their income An arrogant army captainunknown to him that his sister has fallen in love with a sensitive idealisticconfident in his countrymen's ability, offers the people relief if they can beat the fearsome British team at a game of cricket Despite its closeness to the conventions, ""Lagaan"" proved to be a break-out film Besides the graceful and enchanting attractions of the song-and-dance sequences, it has a plot carefully fashioned to a special kind of audienceaudience who likes sports movies They are minor characters compared to the captain's pretty sister (Rachel Shelley), who not only upholds the British tradition of fair play but also loses her heart to the handsome Indian hero"
"In 1893, India was a colony of England. The starving native farmers had to pay an imposed tax to the British soldiers for the protection of their lands, delivering most of their harvest to the British Queen. In those years, the lands were very dry due to the lack of rain, and the inhabitants of Champaner decide to request to their Rajah Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to waive the taxes. While waiting for the Rajah, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the beloved friend of Gauri (Gracy Singh), comments that the silly game of cricket was a stupid game, comparable to the Indian child game 'gilli-danda'. The nasty and arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), who had had a previous discussion with Bhuvan, listens to his comment and challenges Bhuvan to play a match against the British team, imposing the following condition: if the natives win the game, they would not need to pay Lagaan for the next three years. Otherwise, they would triplicate their payment in that year. Bhuvan accepts the bet despite of the opinion of his people. The sister of Captain Russell, Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), finds the competition unfair to the Indians and decides to help Bhuvan and his friends, teaching them how to play cricket. This movie is a magnificent and overwhelming fairytale. It really deserved an Oscar nomination! The nice and well-directed story has wonderful songs and interpretations, romance, treason, dispute, drama, beautiful messages, outstanding choreography, being a stunning film indicated as family entertainment. The expensive Brazilian DVD is a shame, showing a total lack of respect of the 'Columbia Tristar Home Video' with the Brazilian costumers: the important songs do not have subtitles in Portuguese. I changed the option in the 'Menu' to 'English', and there were subtitles in English. At least in the opinion of the ridiculous Columbia representatives, Brazilians shall learn English first to understand the wonderful lyrics sang in Hindi. I feel really sorry for those who cannot understand English, since they will miss the meaning of these songs. It is amazing how 225 minutes running time passes so fast when you see such a marvelous movie. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Lagaan – A Coragem de Um Povo' ('Lagaan – The Courage of a People')"
"I still remember the long queue for the advanve booking of this film. Saw this 3 times in theatre. Then so many times on channel that I lost the count of it. What a lavish n enormous entertainment man. It is more than 3 hours long but doesn't bore u for even a minute. Awesome direction. Awesome screenplay. Awesome editing. Awesome cinematography. Awesome acting by all. Aamir khan was too good man. What an amazing performance of his as teams captain Bhuvan. This movie is more than just a sports movie. This is a great sports movie and even if you don't like sports, it is still a great movie. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is a movie that you should definitely see if you're down because it is a movie about hope. It is also about victory. Lovely songs n awesome music.In 2010, the film was ranked No. 55 in Empire magazines ""The 100 Best Films of World Cinema"". In 2011, it was listed in Time magazine's special ""The All-TIME 25 Best Sports Movies"". Lagaan was listed as number 14 on Channel 4's ""50 Films to See Before you Die"" and was the only Indian film to be listed."
"This  movie not only opened my eyes to the beatuies of india but also the hearts of India. I fell in love with this movie at once and I feel very close to all of the characters I know them and feel for them. The dancing and singing made my heart pound and my heart overwhelmed by the matchless beauty and I was imagining myself following along with Gauri. I love this story and I could watch it daily and never tire of the beauty it holds. I have always loved indian people and the culture which they live, I am American and have never visited India,soon I will visit in person and dreams of going there will no longer tug at me . I hope to one day perform the dances as well as those in the movie.   I really loved that in the movie the characters were faced with such hardship but somehow they were of cheer and sang together and lifted one anothers spirits.I love this movie some may tire of its length but I wish it would continue forever. I want to be a part of it."
"LAGAAN (4+ outta 5 stars) Years of subjugation and unfair taxation by the British Empire come to a head and the inhabitants of a small Indian farming community face off against their evil oppressors... in a cricket match??? This may seem like a ridiculous idea for a movie (and I won't even mention the fact that it's a musical) but this was the most exciting and wonderful movie I've seen in quite some time. Yes, it all comes down to a cricket match between the upper class British twits and the neophyte Indian farmers... and the movie is almost FOUR HOURS long... but, wow... what a movie this is! The slow building of trust and community among the usually-bickering villagers as they prepare for their ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. It's like watching The Magnificent Seven or The Wild Bunch gathering together for a big showdown... only instead of shooting and killing... there's cricket! A cocky British Captain (Paul Blackthorne) makes a deal with the proud, young Bhuvan (Aamir Khan): he will give the entire region three years of no taxes if they can defeat the British cricket team... but if they lose they have to pay triple tax this year. Since there has been no rain all season and they can't even pay their regular taxes... this becomes a tense, do-or-die situation. Aamir Khan is terrific in the lead (he resembles a cross between Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers and Al Pacino). He is always believable, whether trying to inspire his fellow villagers or facing his English enemies in stony silence or wooing his the lovely Gauri (Gracy Singh) with song and dance. Great story! Great music! Don't miss this one!"
"This was my first full-fledged trip into Bollywood and I couldn't have asked for a better entry. While there were some inconsistencies in sound, overall I loved the picture. Some of the songs and dances were breathtaking and emotionally charged. In particular the number where Bhuvan and the young boy are sitting on a hill and they're shrugging their shoulders, soon getting the village into the act. The other number where Bhuvan and Gauri re-enact the love of Krishna and Radha in exquisite dancing. Also there were many moments of stunning, breathtaking images, including the women of the village seated in the temple praying for salvation. Absolutely stunning. While I feel some judicious pruning could have trimmed the nearly 4 hour long version I watched (the DVD of which included an additional 17 minutes cut from this version) the picture did not seem nearly as long as it really was. Aamir Khan is such an instantly likable presence and Gracy Singh is simply irresistible as Gauri. Paul Blackthorne was a hilarious, old-school villain right out of a penny dreadful melodrama  and I mean this as a compliment. Rachel Shelley's Elizabeth was a perfect blend of Victorian reserved beauty and free spirit and noble in her heartbreak. So many other performances ran the gamut from old school ""b"" stereotypical characters to some original ideas.The blending of melodrama (in its purest sense) true comedic moments (the hen keeper), self and enlightenment culminated in the scene where Bhuvan shocks the village by touching an untouchable; his stirring, heartfelt speech about brotherhood and putting away castes shaming the village into enlightenment.Some of the criticism leveled at Lagaan is (I believe) unduly harsh. This is a charming movie and a perfect introduction into the joys of Bollywood."
"Initially I was warned about the length of the movie-3hrs and 50 mins.But believe me, its worth it.There is a refreshing Indian-ness about the movie,which is welcome after a recent bout of Hollywood remakes in Hindi that have become such an eye-sore.The emotion that Indians share about cricket is effectively taken advantage of(the cricket match played between villagers of Champaner and the British officers which forms the climax ,extends to about an hour and a half).The best part of the movie is the characterization of the eleven players (villagers).Aamir Khan is at his best in this movie and Gracie Singh lives the role of Gauri.The acting talents of the British actors esp. that of the officer Captain Russel(played by Paul Blackthorne) is notable.There was never a boring moment in the film, the dialogues and songs' lyrics are very meaningful.And lastly I must appreciate the work behind the entire cricket sequence as it covers most of the aspects of the game and not to mention - match fixing,sledging,body line bowling ,making it gripping till the last ball! A must see for Indian cricket fans!"
"I initially gave this movie a miss after I was totally disappointed by ""Asoka"". The latter was hugely advertised but I don't find it good at all.I finally saw ""Lagaan"" after a friend told me that this movie was actually good. And she was right. I borrowed the DVD from the library and had to see the movie in 2 sessions due to it's almost 4-hour-long running time. But it was worth it!The cricket game was captivating. I didn't know anything about cricket but before the movie ended, I felt that I almost understand the game!I'm not Indian and I seldom see Indian movie even though I love foreign movies, especially Japanese. But ""Lagaan"" is truly the best Indian movie I've ever seen, or at least the best of the year 2001."
"Sony Entertainment's Lagaan is more an experience than a movie.Indian actor Aamir Khan's home production is a cinematic experience which highlights Indian cinema to the hilt, while weaving a tale set in Champaner during the time of the British Empire's presence which deals with Lagaan (the tax of the land) and a village's upheaval against its oppressors.The film revolves mainly around three characters namely Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), Gauri (debutante Gracey Singh) and Elizabeth (British actress Rachel Shelley), and deals with Bhuvan's spirited fight to defend what is his birthright, as he embroils the entire village into a magnitude of problems which inadvertently ends up being their only escape from the tyranny under which they reside. Gauri is the simple village girl who loyally stands behind the man she loves yet cannot profess her love to, while Elizabeth is the beautiful sister of the British Lieutenant and the complication who aids the village in their fight against injustice.The first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is, introducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this period and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through cinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the standard of living. It makes you feel for the characters, believe in the villagers and draws you into the celluloid created world, while the second presents to you their turmoil, dawns on you what is at stake and whisks you away in a tornado of emotions and rising spirits.The opening scenes are more congruent to joining a conversation midway, as from the moment you are thrust into 1893's India, you gain footing and a sense of atmosphere, feeling at ease as the camera pans across its setting for the movie, drifting into the journey that will hold your attention for the duration of the film. Apart from familiarising the viewer with its characters, the first half also takes you back with its breathtakingly beautiful cinematography and fitting background score. The characters are established, the situation presented and relationships etched, with each scene rhythmically flowing from one to the other in a continuos motion.The second half is less involved in justifying its characters and aims more towards culminating the scene which has been set in the first. By this time you are already a part of this world and your emotions have already been stirred, now they are put to the test as the events which will determine the entire crux of the film begin and get the viewer involved.The romantic triangle between Bhuvan, Gauri and Elizabeth is expertly handled. The beauty of its predicament is that no one feels a loss by the end of the film, and director Ashutosh Gowariker beautifully justifies eternal love (but not necessarily requitted love) through drawing a comparison with the spiritual romance of the Hindu god Krishna and Radha. A delightfully delicately handled scene and situation gives birth to the foundation which will resolve the triangle in a manner leaving warmth in the viewer's heart.Aamir Khan is a revelation. His acting is superb and be it the conviction and fire in his eyes, the way he draws breaths from the air of the abode he calls home or even gulps at the atrocities he witnesses, he has become Bhuvan completely. His portrayal is such that it puts you inside Bhuvan's psyche and enables the viewer to understand the character from his demeanour alone. His piercing eyes stare sharply like razor blades, cutting through the camera and leave a haunting impression on an unsuspecting audience, drawing them more and more deeper into his world.Gracey Singh performs ably and is also an extremely graceful dancer, as particularly evident in the Radha Kaise Na Jale song. She acts with her eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, all of her and gives to the role of Gauri completely, giving a debut performance of high calibre.Rachel Shelley makes her presence felt like an ethereal spirit. Apart from looking stunning she adds to whichever frame she is in with panache and style. Her crossover to Indian cinema, or indeed to this film, is delicately handled and a feat to be applauded. To light a face like Shelley's in the same frame as the villagers without making one or the other look considerably darker or awkwardly paler, is a difficult task in itself. But the cinematography, the lighting and make up is such that the characters come alive as physical presences which complement each other, as do Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley. Her interactions with Bhuvan and the villagers are intricately handled and executed wonderfully, and her inclusion in the O Rey Chori song is poetry on screen. To make a Western character dance in Indian cinema without causing a giggle from the audience or without it appearing unnatural is also something which needs to be handled with careful thought and the result is such that this song picturisation alone will invoke discussion on how beautifully it has been shot.Andrew Russell's boisterous character is brought to life by Paul Blackthorne, as he slides perfectly under the skin of a character that should reflect British pride and be menacing and hostile. He performs well and bounces off the supporting cast with utmost ease. The entire ensemble of supporting cast are deserved of mention, and particularly Raghuveer Yadav, who dynamically brings the character of Bhura across effectively and convincingly with edge.A R Rahman is the composer who has scored for many Indian and South Indian films, and this time too he does not betray his reputation of being a modern day Mozart. He literally teases then grabs you with his music, first resonating your veins, then breaths and finally allowing it to explode and burst through your body like an energy force, flowing in sync with your heartbeat. It's lilting melody, fresh sound and courageous allegros mesmerise and reflect the movie's emotions and spirit of hope. The songs are very well picturised and choreography is excellent, particularly Ghanan Ghanan, O Mitwa and O Rey Chori. The bhajan O Paalanhaare is bewitchingly lit and shot, injecting a spiritual vibe as candles' flickering flames hypnotise every viewer whose eyes dance to its command.The film belongs to Aamir and Ashutosh Gowariker all the way. Direction is superb and results in what is a true mark on Indian cinema, held together by Aamir's awe-inspiring performance.Lagaan is about hope, courage, fighting against injustice, the human spirit and about Indians. You enter the cinema to be entertained, and leave with a piece of cinematic history being firmly etched in your heart.Fuad Omar."
"This is actually the first ever film I have seen where the audience clapped cheered and booed effectively as if they were a part of the actual proceedings in the film. I heard someone say that they felt that they were really at a cricket match. I loved the movie even though admittedly at the time (surprising for an Indian) I didn't know cricket at all...I learned while watching it with the help of a friend but also found I didn't need to! It certainly renewed my interest and made mea cricket fan soon enough, the next match that year I watched with grave interest.About the fikm, the acting was good. Rachel Shelly and Paul Blackthorne were impressive and unlike in other Hindi films where they are usually clichéd versions of foreign characters, they were very drawn out believable characters. Aamir Khan was definitely the star attraction (obviously) as in any case it was 'his movie' but honestly he was very good, one of hsi best performances i'd personally say. Gauri was given very little to do in the movie but she did stand out in her own way. The supporting cast were all excellent in each of their roles, although some characters were a bit too starkly depicted. The British cast on the other hand had precious little to do except look foreboding.The setting in the Gujrati village and country was beautiful. The sets were historically accurate I've been told and the backdrop just right for the match and one would it imagine it fit into the time frame suggested. The costumes were also appropriate. I especially liked that scene where Elisabeth imagines Aamir in a suit, it worked because being who she is of course shed see him like that.)Some historians might nitpick on small points, but they were so minor that the rest of the story overshadowed these errors. At first I wondered whether foreign viewers would understand it what the unusual concept of musical numbers, but most seem to have understood the game of cricket (non cricket playing countries I mean) and the historical context as well and seem to have also taken the musical numbers in their stride.The only thing that got to me was the length of the movie. I really wish that they had done some serious editing, it just ran too long and the cricket match was too dragged out. It should have either focused more on the cricket match for the majority of the film, or reduced the footage of the rest of the film to balance it out. I saw many scenes that could have been edited out and were totally unnecessary.The songs were enjoyable and only one or two were unnecessary and could have been cut down or deleted entirely, like the 'Radha Kaise Na Jale' and the song where both girls sing. Honestly this movie was one Hindi movie that did not require many songs at all if at all. A background score maybe but not 6 songs. It got tedious and it gets on the nerves especially when you've been sitting in the theatre for 2 hours and you know that there is 1 more hour to go. Luckily people with DVDs will be able to fast forward!Although Predictable in places with characters being over-drawn or under-drawn and everyone knew the ending that was inevitable, ending, (it isn't much of a long shot at all) but we watched it for the thrill of it anyway.The overall effect the movie was so good that I fully believe that it deserved a nomination and I never say that about most Hindi movies. Even though it did not win I'm very proud of this movie."
"It is seldom in this modern era of IT generation that a long movie surpassing three hours of running time and without a show of synthetic acting, vulgarity and cheap comedy, captivates the audience to stick to their seats. WELL DONE Gowarikar ...... WELL DONE Amir Khan ....... Mr. Gowarikar, please note that if this sublime film had been directed by a British or American director like Danny Boyle or Richard Attenborough .... the Oscars would have definitely flown into the laps of the director and the protagonist actor. This is not to say that your directorial skills lack the excellence to win the coveted Academy Awards, but it is to mention the inherent bias and prejudice which prevails among the jury of the Oscar Award Committee towards directors, producers and actors of the Sub-Continent namely India. Mother India (1957) met the same fate from the then jury of Academy Awards committee who simply rejected its nomination for the Oscars on the grounds that it is laden with too much songs, formulaic in nature. Besides, the excellent performance of Amir Khan as an aggressive and challenging native youth 'Bhavan'; Rachael Shelley has put up a remarkable and evocatively strong performance as the suave young British lady Elizabeth Russell, who aspires to help out the hapless villagers from the cunning guile of his brother, Captain Russel. Now what can one say if the members of the Oscar awarding committee do not understand the meanings of wordings of the emotionally focused songs (due to language and culture difference). It is a handicap with them and not with the local Indian movie making team. Keeping aside this injustice, the movie characterizes pure and pristine feelings, emotions, struggle and fighting spirit of a raw and unskilled cricket team of illiterate Indian villagers who capitalized the opportunity to get waived the odious land revenue tax, with exacting standards of will power and perseverance.After a long time, there is an Indian movie bred with the contents found in the Indian films of yester years."
"1893.  In a small farming community in India stands a British cantonment commanded by the cruel Captain Russell.  When the Raja refuses to bow to his demands to eat meat he doubles the tax that the community must pay  even though the lack of rain means the community can barely pay the normal rate. When the villagers beg for mercy Russell challenges them to a cricket match  to win means the tax is waived, to lose means it is trebled.  One man in the village, Bhuvan takes up the bet and must rally the village to learn the game and win at all costs.I was given this to watch because I had told someone at work that Bollywood movies are essentially a love story where the parents disapprove but it all gets sorted in a big dance number.  So she gave me this to widen my knowledge.  At first read of the plot I thought to myself `this is the air up there' with cricket'  then I saw the 3½ hour running time!  But I said I'd watch it out of courtesy.However let me tell you that the time flew by really quickly.  It only dragged occasionally but for most of the time I was really entertained by the plot and in some cases gripped by the drama.  First of all  I'm not a fan of cricket but this could really be any sport as that is not important to the story.  The plot may be the old `underdog' chestnut but it is still very well done with lots of energy and lots of nice touches that take the chestnut and add just enough difference to it to make it seem fresh.This main plot also has various stories underneath.  The main one being the romance between Bhuvan and Gauri which is complicated by the arrival of Elizabeth, who also falls for Bhuvan.  This is well handled and is very involving  although I don't really like Bollywood song and dance numbers very much, so these slowed proceedings a little for me.  Although many of the songs are comic but also very well choreographed.The film is really helped by the constant interweaving of comedy in the form of the villagers' characters  they fight, they fall down they argue etc  but it is still amusing if not roaringly funny.  However the focus on their plight is never lost  the drama is kept running just below the surface at all times and the final hour is tense.  Tense!  A cricket match!  I didn't expect it to be exciting but at times you are on the edge of your seat  and it isn't as cliched a game as I'd expected it to be!It does have some flaws of course  the film is a little heavy handed at first in making sure we know the British are bad, it is done too early and too quickly  couldn't we have been led to that conclusion rather than pushed straight away?  The songs I found to sound very similar to oneanother  but this may be the fact I don't like them.  To add to this the sound quality between the songs and the dialogue was very different  the songs all had a very studio feel when heard beside the dialogue.  Also the plot is a little cliched  although I after watching it I did think that it was well done and like I said, had nice touches (which I won't tell) that upped the drama  even if you THINK you know how it'll end.But over an almost 4 hr running time, minor flaws can be forgiven.  Khan is a good Bollywood lead but the film helps him by not making him invincible  rather it does show him making mistakes etc.  Singh is good as Gauri even if she is a standard `wide eyes' Bollywood starlet!  Surprisingly good was `Holby City' actor Paul Blackthorne who not only manages to give a really mean performance but does it in both Hindi and English.  He also looks a bit like Sean Connery  or at least he did to me!Overall this manages to make the long running time fly by quite easily  a rare feat for a movie these days.  It is exciting, romantic and comic.  It may have it's flaws but on the whole it is a very entertaining film in many ways."
"This is one of the best entertainers from Bollywood. It has a moving story, excellent music, amazing performances and great dances. All the ingredients are perfectly balanced, resulting in a true masterpiece.To the detractors of this movie(esp the American ones). Granted, on the average, your Hollywood movies are way better than bollywood ones. But your best movies are not even close to the good ones of Bollywood. The reason you may not be able to appreciate good movies like this is that in the US, your life is one dimensional and you don't have the different experiences that people who grow up in India have. For you guys (americans), the world starts from California on the west and ends at NY on the east. Movies are to be enjoyed and not analyzed. If you are of the thinking type, there are lot of other things which you can analyze (proof of Fermat's last theorem for example). Don't apply your analytical skills to movies."
"You can add the name of Ashutosh Gowatrikar to the list of the new generation of Indian Film Directors. An amazing list with the likes of Aditya Chopra (Mohabbatein, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge), Farhan Akhtar (Dil Chahta Hai, Lakshya), Karan Johar (Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai), Sooraj Barjatya (Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, Hum Saath Saath Hain), Sanjay Leela Bhansali (Khamoshi, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam). And Now Ashutosh Gowatrikar (Lagaan).When I went to see Lagaan in the theater, I had certain expectations of what the story was going to be like. But as I watched the film I realized that it was nothing like what I thought. The story was totally unexpected. It was quite a surprise. Never before has a film done that, usually the trailers, promos or songs of an Indian film give the story away and you get an idea of what the film is going to be like, but Lagaan was a total surprise.The story is very well told and each character is well etched. Aamir Khan gives one of his best performances in the film. New find Gracy Singh gives an excellent performance. The Direction and Story of Ashutosh Gowatrikar are beyond words. After watching the film, it is very easy to see why this film was sent to the Oscars for the Best Foreign Film category.A great movie, definitely worth watching at least 10 or 12 times."
"It's my sixth Bollywood film, and I have fallen in love with this one as much as with the others. It's not as warm and colorful as K3G or as funny as Main Hoon Na, but the story is so involving that I spent almost four hours anxiously following the main characters' efforts to win the game. I almost started to bite my nails at the end, keeping thumbs up for Bhuvan and his friends! The strength of the film lies in the fact that it shows how important cooperation, faith and effort are if you want to achieve something in your life. And although I, as a Pole, have no idea whatsoever about the rules of the game of cricket, I was not bored for a second during the second part of the movie - thanks to the director's ability to introduce tension at the right moments. I liked the songs a lot and I think they've been nicely choreographed. The camera work is good, emphasizing the dryness of the land and the hopelessness of the people anxiously waiting for the rain. To sum up, it's a good film with an interesting plot, some catchy music and nice acting. A must-see for a Bollywood fan."
"The movie is nice but a little boring because of its runtime is three hours and some and it tires until the person most patient. The yarn concerns about inhabitants of a village whose leader (Aamir Khan got his ears pierced so that he could actually wear earrings) asks the English deputies for the exemption a tax called Lagaan . Officer at command (Paul Blackthorne) will free them for three years if they earn a cricket match . The officer's sister (Rachel Shelley) will teach them to play cricket game .The film has an excellent musical scenario , the choreography is fantastic , the songs are enjoyable . The movie was shot in villages of Bhuj (Gujarat); Bhuj was destroyed in an earthquake on 26th January 2001, six months after the movie was shot . The first Bollywood production to use synchronized sound , most Indian films are dubbed entirely in the studio in the process . Bollywood has got a lot of experience in this kind of movies . The Bollywood center is located in Bombay , where has been shot hundreds of films .The flick mingles comedy , songs, music , cricket sport, a love story , joy and a lot of fun . The movie is an India/British production though mostly produced by the first country and specially by the main starring : Aamir Khan , a true idol in India with millions of fans. The film will appeal to the musical genre buffs and cricket lovers. Rating: 6'5/10 good . Better than average , well worth watching."
"First things first.its runtime is nearly 3 1/2 - 4 hours.i watched 4 hour movies before,like Sergio Leone's Once Upon a time in the West and Coppola's Apocalypse Now (special editions).even though its lengthy,i never felt bored.in fact i would love to watch it one more time.its really an Epic film in terms of its grand operatic melodramatic emotions and its musical songs.Like Titanic,the first half is about love story & how he formed the team and second half is about exciting emotional scenes.the climax is really nail biting and adrenaline pumping.the lead actor Aamir khan who looks like Tom Hanks,is fantastic.A must watch for the movie lovers.Don't miss it"
"I saw this in a Paris cinema on a Sunday afternoon. The French audience loved it, as did I. They clapped at the intermission and they clapped to the music while the credits were running. I thought the song and dance routines were great, providing the perfect bridge to a semi-mythologised narrative. The audience sometimes laughed at the exaggeration and coincidence of the plot, especially at the end -- the rain, the Englishwoman who never married. Astonishingly they even got the joke about 'this country will be the future of this game'. It seems that lack of knowledge of cricket and subtitles with words like 'runs', 'overs' and 'no ball' were not a handicap. Of course the pillorying of the British didn't go down badly here. I especially liked the representation of the Raj, not as a moderrnising influence, but as straight agrarian civilisation, extraction of the food from peasants' mouths.I was on the edge of tears throughout. Why? Because this was the first Indian production that to my knowledge has won a world audience. And it provided a new sentimental bridge to the world for my own trajectory. I could see how Bollywood is the only film-making centre that actually could do what Hollywood does, but in its own distinctive way, with a much more universal human interest. And the music of course. The plot and characters were caricatured, but that made it all that more accessible and touching, like a medieval passion play. I loved the symbolic roles contrived for the Muslim, the Untouchable, the Sikh, the collaborator, the headman, the intellectual etc.Above all, the plot of learning the game and beating the masters was perfect. It was CLR James to the tee. Beyond a Boundary indeed , with society in the shape of the crowd as much of the action as the players. And the idea of the bet! Play comes from an Old English word whose first meaning is to wager. The idea of life as a game of negotiated risks is very widespread among hunter-gatherers, where people have to be trained to respond instantly to the flash of white tail in the bush. Obviously it sometimes pays for peasants (and citydwellers) to pick up these skills. The play goes on."
"I did not even know what the term Bollywood meant. I had to look it up just now. So I am not gonna try to judge it based on where it was made. I will just tell you what I thought of it as a movie.I have been sick and was ready to head back to bed when my brother said that this movie that just started seems pretty good. I figured I would watch a few minutes and then lay down for my well needed rest. Well, almost 4 hours later, I'm looking up the movie on IMDb.I don't understand the game of cricket at all and, honestly, could care less. I was captivated by the characters and their plight. I was rooting for the underdog The songs were so touching and spiritual. The dance scenes, especially the love dance one, were beautiful.I have read many comments on here that the movie was badly lip sang. I disagree. Until I read it here I hadn't noticed it at all.Overall, I cheered, I laughed at a few of the zanier characters, and I also found myself streaming tears for the young boy. I found myself experiencing the same emotions the English woman was showing during the game.I think they tied everything together well in the end. I ended the movie feeling like I wanted to recommend it to others.So see the movie!! OK. I am finally off to bed."
"I have a school club where I've forbidden all English Language films, so we watch French, German, Korean films, what have you. We never fail to see this one every year and the reaction is always the same, they love it despite the four hour running time. It's a tribute to the movie's appeal, the actors' talent and the movie-maker's storytelling skills. Another wonderful thing about the movie is that the mysterious sport called cricket becomes clearer to the puzzled Filipino. I may have one minor complaint, the musical numbers are full of energy and enthusiasm, but when the British Lady sings it becomes a parody of a Western musical. Otherwise, every Filipino I know who's seen it, young or old, loves it."
"Lagaan is a tale from India in the times were the Indian people had to pay high taxes to the British rulers, since India was considered to be a ''piece'' of the British Empire. In one village where Bhuvan, Gauri and other friends live, they asked for the British rulers to not pay the taxes of that year, since the rains didn't come. The British decides to challenge the guys of that village to play cricket with them: if the Indians win, their wish will become true; if it doesn't, they will have to pay even bigger taxes to the British officers. I think 'Lagaan'is a masterpiece and it was one of the first Indian movies I watched in my life. The costumes and scenarios are beautiful as the musics sang."
"Lagaan rates as one of my top three favorite Hindi movies, along with Devdas and Mohabbatein. Though I am a Caucasian American, my Kutchi wife has evangelized me with scores of Hindi movies in the almost six years of our marriage. While many of them are wonderful (Pardes, DDLJ, Phir Bi Dil Hai Hindustani, Umrao Jaan, Dil Se, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Sholay, Don, Dev, 1942, Roja, Hey Ram, Bombay, Mere Naam Joker, and many, many more), but few stand out as wonderfully written, directed, acted, choreographed, filmed and translated as Lagaan. I heartily recommend it to anyone curious about Hindi films.Aamir Khan's attention to detail is fantastic, as is his energetic portrayal of a young man fed up with the status quo and willing to risk all for a chance to cast the burdensome yoke of British taxation off his village. Revolution without significant bloodshed, beautiful cinematography and choreography, excellent costuming, an intriguing love triangle, and a captivating story line ... all this and an edge-of-your-seat cricket match! Who could ask for more?!"
"Having won multiple awards and gotten itself nominated in the 2002 Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, my interest in Lagaan was actually in wanting to discover more of writer-director Ashutosh Gowariker's works, having seen his latest movie Jodha Akbar, and having bought Swades: We, the People starring Shah Rukh Khan, still unwatched.I've never been a fan of cricket and have never understood the rules, but I suppose after the time you're through with Lagaan, you'll learn at least the basics enough to enjoy the game. No doubt my interest in this sport has been piqued, and non-fans shouldn't steer away from the movie, because knowledge of the sport is not a pre-requisite for you to enjoy this wonderful gem of a sports movie running close to a whopping 3.5 hours (and I heard in the collector's edition, it runs to 4?)Set in British India, we learn that Lagaan is a form of taxation that the villagers have to pay to their Rajas, who in turn pay the British for protection against, erm, invading forces and rivals from other Rajas. In fact, the British were double crossing everyone during their occupation of the country, and bad weather makes the lives of the villagers even more hard pressed since they have zero crops to sell. Every village needs a folk hero, and herein lies Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) who decides to step into the shoes of one, not because of bravado, but because of the atrocities dished out by the British against his fellow countrymen, especially when taxes for the year have been doubled.So the stakes are raised in a game of cricket. Defeat the British, led by Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) and have a tax waver of 3 years for the entire province, or if they lose, then their Lagaan will be tripled. And you don't need a rocket scientist to tell you that when the impoverished have their backs against the corner, they have little choice but to fight back. However, after years of being oppressed and cowering in the face of hardship, you'll need that bright spark or two to shake things up and bring everyone to their senses that Hope is something they have which they can turn into reality if they work at it.The storyline might seem cliché as per the usual sports movies, where our hero Bhuvan has to assemble a team of good men each with their own special farming background which can be incorporated into the game, and recruitment always is a challenge when nobody believes you, and thinks you're the troublemaker who started it all. There are leaders, and there are followers, and some good time is invested to develop this challenge, as well as to explore the plight of the villagers in more detail. The villains of the movie, those pompous Brits personified by Captain Russell with his nose perpetually in the air all the time, are put in very bad light with their looking down of the natives as slaves.But even amongst themselves, the Indians too have their infamous caste system, and this was touched upon when Bhuvan chooses to adopt the more meritocratic route in player selection, and this message undoubtedly stands out. I can't comment much on these themes that Gowariker touch upon in his films, such as that of religious tolerance in Jodha Akbar, but it seems likely that he had incorporated these knowing that his films do appeal to the masses, and therefore serve as a reminder to everyone.While the last 1.5 hours get devoted to the game, where two proud man go head to head against each other with their team, and team members having their own personal vendettas worked out during the matches, it never for a minute played out in a boring manner. In fact, it was entertaining to watch them go through the paces of the game in 101 terms, and from there, those unfamiliar with cricket will likely be able to pick up the basics. Even if the sport is not your cup of tea, its delivery will still appeal to you, as do the usual Bollywood staple of dance and song, as composed by renowned A.R. Rahman - I particularly liked the segment where any self-respective sports movie will have - the training montage, and with a love triangle of sorts fused between Bhuvan, his childhood sweetheart Gauri (Gracy Singh) and Englishwoman Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), sister of the villagers' enemy but one who decides to teach them the game so that they can get on equal terms with her countrymen.Despite its clichés, Lagaan is wonderful entertainment, and you will not realize the movie's running length, as you'll be engrossed in what transpires, and will find yourself rooting for the clear underdogs as they go about trying to battle oppression in unfamiliar terms. Colourful songs and charismatic folk characters, Lagaan unquestionably reinforces my love for Bollywood!"
"I'm not an Indian myself, I'm a Filipina and this is actually the first Indian film I've ever seen but I was automatically enthralled as the film starts playingI have to admit I became engrossed with the film already when the first scenes was where Aamir Khan was. Later on, as Gracie Singh performs superbly with all the musical performances, I decided from then on that I already love this movie! Even though I only have to watch thru the subtitles, it's certainly fine with me. This film was only introduced to me by my cousins during Christmas last year. From then on, I've looked everywhere for this movie in every video stores. Luckily, I got one 2weeks ago and I became so fascinated that I download pictures & wallpapers alreadyall about Lagaan!!! I wouldn't be posting a comment here if I didn't have the Lagaan fever!!! =p The story started in a small village of Champaner , where Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) and Gauri (Gracie Singh) are in a community of poor and innocent farmers who are happily plowing, sowing, praying for the rains and reaping their harvest. Inspite of such unwanted circumstances, they are still full of hope.But then, a British captain, Captain Andrew (Paul Blackthorne), challenges the farmers to a cricket match. He is a capricious character that wants to burden the villagers with a land tax (Lagaan). He waived that there'll be no Lagaan for the next three years and that he'll be the one to pay it from his own pocket. Worst, if they lose, they will pay triple Lagaan for that year. He knows that the villagers are ignorant of the game and its rules. So he's pretty confident that he'll win the game What he didn't know was that his younger sister, Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) is completely against his outrageous ideas Elizabeth's first meeting with Bhuvan already got her attracted to him Unsuspectingly, all of the villagers knows that she helps them purely out of sympathywell, I guess it was that way but she fells in love with Bhuvan later onit just pains me to see that Elizabeth's love for Bhuvan is an unrequited oneshe remained Bhuvan's Radha The cricket match between Indians and British was really superb and very uplifting. Nevertheless, their wit and determination never let go unnoticed. Even the British officers cheered for their victory! It's really a heartwarming storyof Purity in Spirit, Sacrificial Love and that good still prevails..Aamir Khan has absolutely a god-given talentsimply amazinghe dances like any other talented men I know who perform. He was very good in the rolehe looks very appealing especially when Elizabeth imagined him in a princely suit! Gracie Singh looks convincing as Gauri who loves Bhuvan with all her heart. She looks bubbly and cute to me! She displays an excellent facial expression that she can shift from one emotion to another without any difficulty, I guess They are really perfect for each other On the other hand, Elizabeth may have love Bhuvan with the same intensity as with Gauri's but I guess, they weren't really meant to be with each otherthe rest of the men in Bhuvan's team were also fit for their rolesthey never failed to uplift, share their sentiments and inspire methe British officials showcased a role of fairnessthey sympathized and cheered with the villager's victory.For an overall view, the movie was really amazing and I never will get tired watching it all over again. The songs were enjoyable. I can even depict it in my mindsometimes I would hum it 'coz I cannot recite the proper lyricsmoreover, even if this film didn't win in the Oscarsit's all worth it"
"I normally find sports films only mildly interesting. Stuff like Field of Dreams for example is OK, but only because it deals with big issues, like what's important in Life. Also, I normally detest Football and Cricket. When I was young I was forced to watch both - I never understood either and got bored pretty quickly. I think that Cricket is a game best broadcast on radio, and Footy on TV. Most times, they both bore me.Not so in this case. The match only takes up the last 45 minutes of this 210+ minute film, but the build up to it is quite good filled with intrigue, a love story, and a number of song and dance routines. By the time you get to the match you are totally aware of its importance, and how the Villagers are the underdogs. I won't give away the ending, but it really is suspenseful to the very end.If you only see one ""Bollywood"" film, make it this one!"
"Like most Bollywood films, this one satisfies on a lot of levels - music, song, dance plot. Hit has history, sports and romance. Unlike Morton, I had a good DVD copy from my local public library, the colors were brilliant and vibrant. The story contains a lot of clichés, but that's Bollywood, but at least the Victorian Indian setting gives a new twist.At almost four hours, I did find it long. I would advise taking a break at the intermission. Maybe watch it over two nights - or make dinner during intermission!!!!Great movie T"
"finally a movie worth watching. Unique from the antediluvian and stale topics of Bollywood( love, stupid fights and family crap).Lagaan is a movie perfectly planned by the director manipulating three most powerful weapons against the people of these Continent, 1 cricket 2 love and emotions and 3rd is their pre independence life and miseries and poverty issues addressed and how people were used by east Indian companies. the topic of cast differentiation and sectarianism has been India's old headache also nailed very well in this movie.Love of gracy singh for Amir khan and the English lady affectionate towards Amir gives a romantic touch to this solid plot of perfectly directed and acted movie.India needs movies like this. different from usual and solid and moral in the end. Lagaan made my dayTreacherous addition of the plot was also well played by the actors. Love, Passion for cricket, status of life before independence, Snake in ones own sleeves, Desire for making impossible possible, sentimental personalities with strong family relations,A glimpse of hope a midst the deep darkness is all creates the life of this continent well narrated and played. the movie was a bit lengthier 224 minutes, God i had to pee thrice in between.But aside from all pros and cons, that is a movie. or in Wll Smith's style "" Now That Is What We Call A Movie""bravo director and well done team Lagaan"
"I am writing this review after a decade passed out ...and i read all the users review from worldwide ..and I .....cant express in words For so many years we INDIANS and the Indian film industry is being a joke to most of the world and I really cant blame them ..but sometime it hurts when someone mock us or ignore our creativity just because we have different approach as They say....songs in movies HA HA HA .... Yes we make some foolish crap movies every year but which film industry doesn't ..??? even Hollywood ...a bad Hollywood movie is simply bad and good one is Master piece....but when it comes to us .... bad movie turn to foolish and goods one simply ignored because ooH it has songs ...I am not blaming anyone here and I am a huge fan of Hollywood movies also ....I am just saying that we too have some masters at works and some classic masterpiece and PLZ don't be stereotype and I am happy to say that most of the ppl from every corner of world are not ....YES lagaan is a epic and so are RANG DE BASANTI , CHAK DE India , AND MANY OTHERS ..THANKS FOR READING ..JAI HIND"
"I have watched this movie 3 times and laughed, cried and cheered each time, even though I already knew what was going to happen.  I have also seen the movie that won the Academy Award, ""No Man's Land"". It was good, but Lagaan was better. The book that Satyajit Bhatkal wrote, ""The Spirit of Lagaan"" that tells the story, from concept to birth is well worth reading.  The movie gets 8/10 stars from me."
"I have never been able to find a Bollywood film that was so easy to sit thru the entire film without getting impatient. Excellent pacing, appealing acting, good music and about perfect movie entertainment. I've seen quite a number of Bollywood musical productions as the local Indian fast food restaurants tend to play non-stop DVDs that splice only the music and dance numbers together. It's been very hard to get a good recommendation of an entire film to see. The few that I've been able to watch were tough going, mainly due to the length and corny plot lines. The musical numbers were usually entertaining. I had to stop this film (on DVD) and resume watching it at a later time. I found myself watching from the beginning again and not getting bored! Director Ashutosh Gowariker has developed an excellent technique that I think the subtitle of the film gives a clue where his inspiration comes from. There are many scenes that remained me of the way Sergio Leone built scenes, introduced new characters and involved the viewer in the story. Really impressive.There is one problem, if this is your first Indian musical/drama, there's not much in league with this film. To extend the Leone connection, it's like watching ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and then trying to find another Spaghetti western that comes even close.Excellent."
"I really liked this movie. It was the first movie that was mainly in Hindu and I thought it was beautiful and had great music. I love musicals like Guys and Dolls and the Music Man and I love the music, but when I saw this it realized how bad and out of place the English language was in the beautiful rhythmic singing. I am not a sports person and this movie definitely had a sports theme, but I didn't mind it. It felt kind of long towards the end when they played the game. It was a story of facing adversity in anyway. Its love story was told completely without kissing which in this day and age is very impressive. I love this movie for the filming music and costumes."
"Don't be put off if you're unfamiliar with cricket. I was surprised, given the film's intended audience (i.e., Indian), but ""Lagaan"" bends over backwards to make sure that even people who have never heard of cricket know what's going on and understand the rules as much as they need to in order to appreciate the progress of the game. (North American baseball and football films are never so charitable to outsiders.)And forget the reputation the sport has among those who don't know how it's played. Cricket is, in fact, the most exciting, and certainly the most dramatic, of all sports. Yes, test matches can last up to five days (and had been known to last longer before the five-day limit was imposed), but that's the point: only cricket CAN last for five days without sending the crowd to sleep. Most other sports would be pushing it at two hours. Only a game of cricket COULD bear the emotional weight which ""Lagaan"" places upon its lengthy finale. The conclusion to ""Lagaan"" is long, at once exhilarating and almost unbearably tense  and, ultimately, liberating.No other sport is so well suited to the democratic ideals ""Lagaan"" wishes to express, either. It's possible to describe someone by saying ""He looks like a rugby player"" or ""He looks like a basketball player""; but ""He looks like a cricket player"" is meaningless. Almost any physical skill can find a foothold in cricket. (And you never know WHICH skill will prove crucial in winning a match.) Cricket admits all sorts; but once admitted, the division of labour is admirably egalitarian. Every single player, even those who got into the team solely on the strength of their ability to throw a ball so as to make it bounce sideways, must bat; everyone, even those whose only natural ability is to swing a bat at a moving object, must field. It's a pity that not everyone must bowl, but the uncertain length of innings would make such a rule unworkable; and anyway, in long test matches especially, a cricket captain would LIKE every member of his team to be able to bowl, and certainly wants as many different styles of bowling at his disposal as possible. The result of all this is, the world's best cricket players look nothing like one another, yet considerably like ordinary human beings.But back to the film. It's marvellous. It comes along at just the right time to prove (although it has been proven many times in the past) that films considerably longer than Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" episodes don't have to be monumentally boring. ""Lagaan"" is never less than entertaining, and (despite the occasional moment when it stretches too far  there are maybe two or three moments in the whole three-and-three-quarter hours) ends up being genuinely moving and inspiring. By saying this I'm probably betraying the fact that it's the first big Bollywood picture I've seen; but it also shows that the skill and energy required to stage live action musical numbers has not vanished from the face of the Earth, after all. It's not true that ""Lagaan"" has everything. It's better than that: it has precisely as much as it can hold together in the one story, and no more.Just one teensy little criticism Spoiler aheadAs you'd guess from the subtitle (""Once Upon a Time in India""), ""Lagaan"" is, in addition to everything else, a fairytale; or at least, while the bulk of its presence is elsewhere, it has a kind of shadow life as a fairytale, too. The rule-of-three motif is used frequently: the same thing happens twice; then, the third time, it's different. I was expecting this rule to be used on the elephant (and I'm sure everyone else in the audience was, too). Two times the ball rolls through a gap in the boundary to annoy a nearby elephant; I was sure that the third time this happened, the elephant would sit on the ball, thus allowing the local team (probably when they were struggling with batsmen who for one reason or another were constrained in their ability to run back and forth, or when they needed to score a seemingly impossible number of runs in the last few overs) to get, say, ten runs off the one ball. But it didn't happen. We never see the elephant again. The game DOES end in fine style, and I suppose in a manner more respectful to the nature of the game, but all the same  I was a little disappointed. That's all.I wasn't disappointed by anything else."
"First movie by an actor's production house, a director high on technicality, unlimited budget and lots of publicity--- combine all this and u have lagaan. Publicised as ""Once Upon a Time in India"" -- the once upon a time is just incidental. It is definitely not a period movie, but emphasises on its setting to justify a large canvas. The plot is about some village people trying to beat an English team(englishmen who are the all-in-all for smooth running of the British empire) in a game of cricket so that they do not have to pay any taxes(lagaan) for the next three years. The movie is excellent technically--well choreographed songs, beautiful cinematography etc but that is all the movie has to it. The actors too play their part, which is not substantial, fairly well. The movie has been stretched to almost 4 hours but the plot deserves no more time than a routine movie..(In fact, there is not much plot at all.) There is not even a single actor other than Bhuvan(played by Aamir) which is developed. The movie focusses solely on Aamir and does not allow any other strong character to emerge. The stress on good cinematography (read good looking scenes ) is so large that peasants(poor, starving and all) living in pre-independence India wear freshly laundered (as good as new) clothes most of the time. It just does not look like that these are the poor peasants struggling to save their land but just a cricket team which is desperate to score a win over a fancied team. The love triangle is not even a triangle but a fleeting line....All in all, a movie which looooks good but just that... Its soul is missing...And as for the length of the movie , for people who can watch test matches from start to end may find it to their liking."
"Unlike, say, Once Upon a Time in China, with which this film shares at least its English (sub)title, this is populist anti-Western colonialism done right! For one thing, having the villains actually be white goes a long way; Paul Blackthrone is an extremely effective ""evil Englishman,"" and he actually speaks Hindi for a good chunk of his role! As a result, we get a real struggle, rather than an ultimately-meaningless proxy battle as we usually do in Tsui Hark's film. This is, however, no Gibsonesque exercise in Anglo-bashing, and everything comes out extremely balanced, perhaps too obviously so. He does, after all, have a sister that helps out the village people as they try to learn cricket and beat his wager. More importantly, untouchables and Muslims, despite earlier misgivings, are welcomed into the team, providing a heartening, inclusive vision of Indian resistance against the occupier.What's nice about this film is that it is clearly a high-profile Bollywood picture with an eye towards crossover, but it is not so compromised that it becomes unrecognizable to anyone who is already somewhat familiar with Bollywood. I imagine this is one of the better ""gateway drugs"" for the genre, as the music is good and fits with the plot, and one rarely feels that the more-than-three-hour running time is needlessly padded. Sure, they could have made it shorter, but this is actually epic enough to deserve it."
"I bought this DVD on the strength of 1.) Aamir Khan's fabulous performance in ""Dil Chahta Hai"", 2.) Customer reviews and 3.) The film's Oscar nomination for best foreign language film in 2002. Well, the fact is that Aamir Khan truly does light up the screen in this outing as he did in the aforementioned. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that every moment he is on screen is a delight. Goodness only knows why the Western film industry have failed to recruit this considerable talent. He is a gifted actor, is profoundly charismatic - and a great dancer to boot! Unfortunately, he isn't on screen for the whole 215 minutes. Moreover, his co-stars pale by comparison. (No pun intended.) Be they the simpering girlfriend, the English Rose or the pantomime British villain, they are all lacking somehow. Thematically, the film is in the time-honored (fairytale) tradition of the ""Rocky"" movies but on long-play. It drags to an overly long conclusion. And I hardly think four song and dance routines qualify this movie as a musical - especially as none of them are particularly memorable.I've no idea why the film was nominated for an Oscar. Either it was a bad year for foreign films or the Academy must have felt obliged to include an Indian film for once. It's clear why it didn't win. It's not bad but it isn't Oscar material by a long way."
"To say it straight forward as possible, a very disappointing film, wasn't even worth a dollar to rent it. I wouldn't recommend this film at all except, for one who enjoys the experience of diversity in film making, and long, slow, typical movies and little music skits. This was a very slow predictable movie, and was throughout the 3 ½, and more, hours. The storyline seems very similar to kid's movies from Disney relating to little children playing sports and some really corny soap opera. The whole time I was expecting some in depth, mysterious, beautifully woven scenes to come in, because it was actually nominated for an Oscar and was pretty popular ,but, they never came. It didn't do anything for me personally, but, I see some people enjoy the experience of the diversity in movie making and Bollywood movies, I would recommend it those people only."
"I liked the dancing and the general cheerfulness. It's nice to see men singing and dancing together. Though I do wonder how on earth did this could get nominated for an Oscar!?!??It's such a simple and banal film, looking like something from TV. The story was like a children's film! How could they stretch this to four hours!?!?!?!? Incredible! It should have been two hours at the most.The Indian actors were good, especially the woman playing Gauri, but the British ones were terrible! The main bad guy and his sister were awfully bad. The sister would not have been tolerated helping the Indians like that. She would have been sent away, not allowed to watch the final match."
"when i went into the film, i expected the match to end at half time, followed by some sort of armed uprising by the villagers to overthrow the british, or at least make an attempt. nothing like that. the whole film builds up to one long cricket match.the first time gracy singh came on the screen, i thought she would become someone else's girl, probably raghuvir yadav. i was shocked to discover she was the ""heroine"" !!the english actor who was the ""villain"" looked more like a spolt rich schoolboy than even remotely dangerous or evil."
"Yeah I watched lagaan the year it came out and I thought it was one the best movies that Indians have ever made and they should be proud of themselves.Its movies like these that make a person feel good about themselves and it makes you want to achieve more in life.I remember when I first watched Lagaan (3yrs ago), it was on VHS the print was terrible but it didn't stop me from watching it. I loved it even though they had cut some bits out. I later got it on DVD and I must say the quality is much better. I kept watching this movie over and over again and have studied it also, I love the making of a movie its so intriguing.Everyone puts on great a performance; Aamir khan is the Protagonist, he so realistic and versatile. He has been my fav actor since 1990 in Dil, he was great, he's one of the finest actors Bollywood has (Also you have got watch Dil Chahta Hai he puts on a great performance). Gracy is new and unique she will do fine, no one would have suited as lead actress except her, a great job. All the eleven members of the team also deserved to be applauded it was cause of them that lagaan worked, same goes for the other opposite team. Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne have done great acting; since they can't speak Hindi it would have been very difficult. They bring a certain amount of realism to the story and how British people use to be like back in the late 1800's.But most importantly, the man behind the scene deserves the most credit Ashutosh Gowariker the writer and director. This would not have been an easy movie to make and bringing it to silver screen is something amazing.I have been reading other peoples comments on lagaan as well, and many people have a problem that the length of the movie is to long, (hey look at the bright side at least you get your moneys worth) I can understand, in the beginning I found the movie a tad slow but it needed to introduce u to the village, characters, and most importantly the time frame. But once that goes ur glued to the movie till the end.Indian movies are very different to western movies, and what makes it unique are the song and dance routines, I thought the music and lyrics were so beautiful. The background music was superb. People also complained that song and dance routines are waste of time I don't think so, I think it's a way celebrating life and people like that.I really wished that lagaan would have got the Oscars, it would have been the first one for India, and all their hard work would have payed off. I haven't seen No mans Land but from the sound of it, it looks good. India just had some tough competitors.Now that lagaan has opened doors internationally India will very soon get an Oscar and I think it will be an Aamir Khan movie, which will get it.Lagaan will always remain a story untouched; Wonderfully made and showcased, I would give it ten out of ten, one of the greatest movies of all time."
"The story line is your basic underdog movies so I can't say it has an original story.  Having watched or rather endured numerous foreign films, I normally expect production quality to be poor at best.  This one has production quality that rivals your Hollywood studios.  Add to this it has managed to blend drama, sports competition and musical dance numbers into one film which actually works and its simply one of the best movies I've seen foreign or domestic.Oh, don't let the length of the film scare you off... though it may be longer than Gandhi, you'll never be bored or restless during this one."
"This film has undeniable strengths, but there are serious weaknesses that keep it from being a great film. The characterization is simplistic, it's WAY too long (the climactic cricket game is most to blame for this) and the conclusion is obvious from the first frame. That said, though, the acting is great, the photography excellent, and the music simply magnificent. Well worth watching, but keep the remote control close by. You'll need ""Fast Forward"" more than once. Rating: 6/10."
"An interesting mix of the bollywood stereotype and the western film. was a bit bothered by the whitey / darkie thing going on though, but still very good."
"Lagaan evokes emotions by tapping into the Indian psyche.  It distills into film the more exciting moments from a cricket game; batters getting pummeled, wickets getting knocked over, home runs, centuries, and tide-turning errors.  The film also has droughts, evil British oppressors, and a pitiful Untouchable kid.Unfortunately these symbols don't resonate with my ABCD brain.  Removing them, Lagaan is left me with flat characters, a simple plot, an undeveloped lovestory, and an awfully long running time.Purely as a sports movie I think Lagaan falls short.  Compare it to Karate Kids and Rockys.  There, the competition is not so focused on the win/lose/tie outcome, but on the heroes gaining self-respect.  Instead, Lagaan's Indian team lacked a coach-figure inspiring them to ""do your best; don't lose to fear.""  Instead, they had Aamir Khan telling them ""try to let me handle it""The game-ending scene in Lagaan is about as fulfulling as G.W. winning the Florida election or Brazil winning the 1994 World Cup.  The outcome hinges on chance, not effort.Songs and lyrics are fun but have a major problem: most of the the lip-syncing is not convincing.  You see the mouths chatting in a desert while you hear the singers screaming in a closet.  They don't blend well. Save the echo and reverb for the soundtrack CD."
"This movie shall attempt to drag you into the colonial India, which has been created in a mould as to justify the movie's weak script, in which of all the inane things, the British try to settle a row with the Indians over Land Tax [i.e Lagaan] with a Cricket Match! Its a combination of sorts of the Baseball movies Hollywood keeps churning out [with the plot of a small town team making it to the big league and so and so), and the various over-glamourised period films. The premise of the film is hence utterly ridiculous. It shall drag along for good 4 hours, the second half being a supposedly exciting Cricket Match with a nail biting finish! And oh, the ending is so predictable, the movie, however is partly saved by the various unknown actors' and actresses' decent performance.
To top it all, this movie has innumerable songs which just test the viewer's patience. The makers should know that the international commercial audience shall NEVER accept the mindless song and dance routine that the Indian Cinema is infamous for. The direction, though a notch up from the usual Indian stuff is nevertheless bland and uninspiring. Basically, a wannabe hollywood type sport movie set in the colonial era. And we should of course know here, that Cricket is to the subcontinent what Baseball is to America. On the whole, a forgettable picture, more so because it goes on  for 4 whole hours! No doubt the movie bombed at the box  office across the United States.
Better off without it."
"That's funny. I always thought the reason of ""Lagaan"" continuous presence on IMDb Top 250 was due to its being ""a little more than"" your typical Bollywood movie, as if the opposite was a disqualifying parameter. I confess, from my slightly prejudiced perspective, I thought ""Lagaan"" was an empowering sports movie about the triumph of human spirit etc. but again, not the ""typical"" Hindi movie. But that would have been overlooking the subtitle: which goes straight to the point: Once Upon a Time in India. I guess if you set a story in India, you better tell it the ""Indian way"".So, the fact is: ""Lagaan"" IS your ""typical"" Bollywood movie, but that's not saying much as the director Ashutosh Gowariker finds that little extra push to elevate the film above the expectations of a national audience, thus delivering a story of universal appeal: something about the fight for dignity and justice, an underdog story with the same resonance as ""Rocky"", and told in an old-fashioned way with a despicable villain and a colorful gallery of challengers that goes from a handsome hero, a brute with a golden heart, a sneaky traitor, a comic relief etc. The film use many familiar elements from both Bolly and Hollywood's canon but the result is so enthralling, so exhilarating that it gets away with it.And take it from someone who's never been a fan of that Bollywood trope requiring that characters can break into singing and dancing in such a so well-choreographed act you wouldn't believe it's one of these spur-of-the-moment things. But the power of ""Lagaan"" is to know exactly what the audience longs, an emotional roller-coaster that includes singing and all dancing. There's such boldness in making a movie almost four hour longs by adding nothing that clearly advances the plot that even someone who's not familiar with Bollywood will understand that music isn't just an ornament, but as vital to the enjoyment as the rest. The film was long and riveting enough, but ""Lagaan"" primarily addresses its own audience and with such gusto that it widened its appeal to foreign audiences.But the story had a part to play in that success. Its premise alone is captivating: at the peak of the British Empire in India, an arrogant and racist Captain named Andrew Russel, commanding the province of Champenar, doubled the Lagaan tax to the villagers, who are already taxed to the bone. But with this new measure, they risk starvation and misery. Phillips (well-played by Paul Blackthorne) is no man to care for such considerations. And when the young and rebel villager named Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) goes with a few villagers to ask the local Rajah to intercede, the man with one foot in each world admits he's powerless. Russell spices up the situation, he challenges the villagers to beat them in cricket, a game Bhuvan called stupid, if they win, they won't pay Lagaan for three years, if they lose, they'll have to play triple Lagaan.When Bhuvan accepts, he faces a major uproar from the other villages of the provinces and before winning the game, there's a long process of winning the villagers' spirit and the process is crucial to reveal more about the characters and the setting. Meanwhile, Philips confronts his superiors and understands he'd rather win the game or he might pay the Lagaan from his own pocket. The dice are cast and we follow the training of villagers who never understood cricket, let alone played it. But it's not much in the game than the anticipation, to see these peasant trying to defy the British establishment, it's both funny like ""The Full Monty"" but many highly dramatic moments remind us that lives are at stakes and it's not just a game. The odds are worse but they've got to beat them.They are trying to win with what they have at hands and turning their flaws into tricks is the kind of inspirational material you expect from sport movie. One of the villagers is swift with slingshots, which earned him an ability to launch a ball so fast you literally don't see it coming, another one with a defect in his hand is able to make the ball spin, his status as a pariah allows a film to make a few comments about the caste system, to make sure there is an equivalent to British' ruthlessness. And to make up for the vileness of Captain his sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), finding her brother's method cruel and unfair help the villagers, much to the displeasure of Gaury (Gracy Singh) in love with Aamir. There are many subplots in the movie and they swiftly overlap just like the many rules of that cricket game that you don't need to understand in order to enjoy the film.Each sub-story is bound to a specific emotion, there's romance, there's drama, comedy and tragedy, and at the climactic game, all these element come full circle together. And no matter how hard you expect the game to be, how many sports movie you've seen, no matter how firmly you anticipate that it will all comes down to one final blow, the film will still manage to surprise you. And that's the power of Lagaan that Ebert summed up very well, you enjoy it, you realize it's new and fresh although it's a very familiar material. You really enjoyed it. It is Bollywood but its appeals transcend the story.It has escapism, fun, colors, it's the kind of film, you can't say they don't make them anymore well except maybe in Bollywood, the quintessential place for popular cinema. And it is an empowering sports drama about the triumph of human spirit."
"The best cricket movie ever made.Set in India in the late-1800s, the local British rulers are imposing excessively high taxes on the local population. One of the local villagers has a run-in with the senior British officer, resulting in a cricket match between the British and the villagers. If the villagers win, they don't have to pay taxes for three years. If they lose, they have to pay three times their usual taxes.Interesting, engaging movie with some of the most realistic cricket scenes you'll see in a movie. The April 2004 edition of The Wisden Cricketer, probably the foremost cricket magazine in the world, had their list of the top 10 cricket moments in movies, and Lagaan come in at number 1. I wholeheartedly agree with their assessment. Cricket in movies is normally very badly done, looking as if the director had no clue about the sport. Even Bodyline, the movie about the infamous 1932 Bodyline series, had some laughable moments (eg the England wicket-keeper, Les Ames, standing up to the wicket for the express pace of Harold Larwood!). Considering that it was a movie exclusively about an historic cricket series, thus is even more cricket-centric than Lagaan, which is as much a human drama as a cricket movie, Bodyline's cricket scenes were very badly done. (Bodyline's script was just as bad, very biased and propaganda-like: going out of it's way to be anti-English). I expected similar inaccuracies in Lagaan and was pleasantly surprised. While there are some minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this is truly the most accurate and best cricket movie ever made. It is also good as a drama, not just a cricket movie, so recommended for those less-into-cricket too. (Aside: Bodyline came in at Number 3 on Wisden's list)."
"First and foremost, to enjoy this film, and you can--very much--the viewer should leave behind the cynical contemporary moviegoer who expects irony and sarcasm and nasty humor and fart jokes. This is an old-fashioned film about old-fashioned values, and the fact that it was made in India makes little difference.Lagaan pits good against repression, the individual against the system, and although to a modern viewer the outcome may be obvious, its great fun getting there, with a lead actor who very much resembles the early Tony Curtis, full of impish sexuality and the power to use it, a man who challenges an unjust system--in this case the rule of the English Raj before 1900. He impulsively challenges a ruling officer, a really nasty type reminiscent of previous villainous prototypes...and then he must meet his challenge. Viewers not accustomed to the Bollywood product should be able to believe that hundreds of drought-stricken villagers could break out in unified and very colorful song when they see black clouds on the way--if so, and you like romance and being on the winning them, this film is great fun indeed!"
"in the history of Indian cinema it is top ten movie. India ruled by British so many years. after many years of the struggle India got freedom from them.and cricket is the every Indian favorite game introduced by British.this movie is mix of Indian freedom struggle and cricket.plot is a villagers in north India waived tax by winning cricket game against British officers.villagers don't know about cricket surprisingly their coach is Britisher.Indian freedom movement also raised with help of British people like Annibesent,A.O Hume etc..in this movie villagers have different mind set and from different communities.as a leader BHUVAN united them,like Gandhi in freedom movement.quarreling brothers united for a game.Harijan and other cast people united for victory.A.R.Rahaman music played vital role in the victory of movie.excellent background score.Ashutosh Gowariker history specialist only director in Indian cinema have the courage to canvass historical movies.i watched this movie 10 years ago when i was watching i surprised. is I am in movie theater or in a cricket stadium,because people shouting through out the movie for cricket scenes.i never saw like that before and after for any movie that much of response from audience in theater .people enjoyed cricket and love story of the movie Indian movie formula two heroines also work out."
"Analysis of A.R.Rahman's background score in Lagaan In Lagaan, every known ingredient of a typical Indian masala film is in near perfect proportions. A.R.Rahman had to follow and use almost every single film scoring rule and technique for writing the background score of Lagaan. Every principal character gets a musical theme. Every dramatic moment gets an uplifting music score. Every song's melody is used appropriately in the background score throughout the film. Every musical theme that is not based on any of the song's melody is deliberately tuned catchy, so that it could get a life even out of the film. There are big bangs and grand orchestral outbursts. There are moments with measured silence amidst ample music. Every tear-jerking moment is filled with an instrumental soliloquy. Every instrument in the score is carefully chosen, and every piece is carefully orchestrated to convincingly transport us, a century back in time. The beauty of Lagaan's background score lies in the way all of these techniques come up in the right proportion, in the right context, in the right moments of the film....... to read more go to the link given below www.backgroundscore.com/2011/06/10th-anniversary-of-lagaan.html"
"Everything I ever need to know about cricket I learned from this movie.""Lagaan,"" in typical Bollywood fashion, is ridiculous and ridiculously entertaining. It sounds like something conceived by Bialystock and Bloom -- a 3+ hour musical about British imperialism in India and the sport of cricket -- but much like ""Springtime for Hitler"" it ends up working like a dream.""Lagaan"" was nominated for the 2001 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it lost to ""No Man's Land,"" the first and only entry from Bosnia and Herzogovina in that category. This is also the year that produced ""Amelie"" as a nominee -- what a great year for foreign language films.Grade: A"
"Lagaan has to be my favorite Bollywood film to date.When a local British governor doubles the lagaan (tax) on a small village in the midst of a drought, the villagers make a deal that they'll be free of Lagaan for 3 years if they can beat the British in a game of cricket, or suffer triple the tax if they lose. Trouble is, they don't know the first thing about the game. It's a typical sports story with a rag tag team of underdogs squaring off against an experienced, arrogant veteran team vividly dramatizing the Indian fight against British oppression. The well executed story is buttressed with lavish Victorian era costumes, beautiful cinematography, and several musical numbers that are a cut above the average Bollywood song-and-dance numbers."
"This film happens to the very first Bollywood film that I have watched in its entirety. Not being a fan of musicals, I braced myself as I popped in the DVD. Well, 225 minutes past by rather quickly and although there were moments where I was wondering exactly why I was watching a musical, but most of the time I was fairly well entertained. I mean, granted, my critical side could pick at this film for a while, but that didn't lessen my entertainment.The story is a pretty simple one and rolls forward predictably. The setup is this: poor Indian farmers get taxed by local British cantonments through their raj. One day the British capriciously demand double tax (lagaan = tax) and the villagers, suffering from an extended drought ask for it to be lifted. The big bad Brit offers them a challenge: win a cricket game against the Brits and no taxes for three years. Lose and pay thrice over. I like the word thrice.Complications arise as you have a British woman who goes against her tyrannical brother and secretly aids the Indian team. Of course, since it's a classically styled musical, there's a romance, complicated by a triangle (or perhaps a quadrilateral). And since it's a sports film (a cricket film), you have your requisite training montages. Since it's a musical, you have plenty of musical/dance numbers. And it's a recruiting film, so you could call it Bhuvan's Eleven.All right, the good stuff first. The production values are high, the photography is gorgeous at times, the acting is simple but effective, the story is unapologetically escapist, the song and dance numbers aren't so silly that I wanted to skip them and at least one of them actually moved forward the underlying drama, rather than being just a number. And then there's the tension. The stakes are high from the beginning and the cricket game itself is presented in just a way that the tension never really lets up until all almost four hours is said and done.One of the problems is that the characters are all very simplistic. The villain character is played over the top, which makes sense in the simple world of simple characters that's described here. Perhaps if you let yourself get caught up in the simple world presented and can hit the switch in your brain that cares about what's real, this isn't a problem. But I think the character is so entirely bad (and the hero so entirely good) that it's hard to believe characters in this movie to be real, for the most part.Another problem I have with this film is a problem I have with most musicals: many of the song and dance numbers are long and some of them are unnecessary for the purposes of storytelling. I understand that it's all part of a show, but sometimes I feel like all these things are either just tacked on, or a story is tacked onto a series of somewhat related songs. Which was why I was relieved that not every number was pointless. The movie is also really long and some trimming could help it be a little easier to find time to watch.I'd say that its escapism is a negative trait, but I can't help but wonder if the primary audience is one that faces the harsh realities of the world every day and needs a little hope in their lives. All the same, I can't help but wonder if some of the little things the film does to ""say something"" about the problems of the caste system, etc., are done with little meaning, but to just appease the hopes of those watching. There is something to say about the critics of escapist films in that it helps keep the disenfranchised appeased in their situation and holding out hope rather than doing something themselves to change the situation.And when it comes to believability, the initial love triangle is fairly believable, but the second complication makes me uncomfortable, since it appears to be over-idealized and part of me thinks that it's also, in part, an unbelievable male fantasy, even if not acted on.Still, for as long a watch as it was, I was suitably entertained. The only real barrier to me watching more Bollywood films in the future is carving out the heroic amount of time necessary to take one in. I suspect that this film will be a joy to musical lovers. 7/10."
"I had seen spoofs of the Baliwood genre (The Guru comes to mind) but this is the first I have actually seen. I liked especially that they used subtitles instead of dubbing. It was an interesting look at the time and culture of Victorian India from the Indian as opposed to Euro-centric viewpoint. The musical numbers bring to mind Hollywood of the forties and Broadway.I was interested too to see the costumes and props of the period, again from the Indian point of view. It is not something kids growing up in white-bread suburbia get exposed to as a rule, at least not in the 60's and 70's when I was in school. So I found it educational as well as entertaining.There was certainly more of the older style Hollywood in the acting than the more ""method"" approach of modern actors. Characters were archetypal rather than deep or subtle."
"Lagaan is absolutely a stunning piece of work by the producer-director team of Aamir Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker. It is one of the best films i have seen in my lifetime if not the best. Thoroughly entertaining and without meaningless subplots. The screenplay is as good as it gets and the 3 hour+ film just flies by. The cricket match in the climax is an absolute highlight of the film and is as nail biting as a real sports match. The game is explained so wonderfully during the film that people with very little or no knowledge of cricket will understand what cricket is all about. Aamir Khan is delightful as the enthusiastic Bhuvan. He takes to the role as a fish takes to water. He is one of the best actors of India and people who see the film will see why he is reckoned a perfectionist in India. In short, he does magnificently well doubling as the producer and the protagonist. Newcomer Gracy Singh (Gauri) is a revelation. She is simply adorable as the jealous village belle. She dances her way into viewers' heart esp in the ""Radha kaise na jale"" number. Rest of the cast is on target as well. The music by A.R.Rehman is another positive aspect of the film. The songs heighten the impact of the film unlike many other Indian films where songs act as deterrents in the ongoings. Cinematography has to be seen to be believed. All in all a brilliant effort. That too without leaving the commercial parameters."
"Most Indian movie fans seem to think that if a movie doesn't have Govinda doing his pelvic gyrations, or if some big-busted vamp/heroine doesn't do a ""choli key peechay kya hai?"" number, then it is Oscar material!   How pathetic.This film, apart from being long and boring, is also totally unrealistic. How easy would it have been to get a low-caste person on the same team as the upper-castes, and that too, a hundred years ago?   For our ""hero"", Aamir Khan, it is a piece of cake!   A few sugar-coated words, and voila!, everybody falls in line!   Well, that effort alone (of convincing the team-mates about playing alongside a lower-caste person) could have been a movie in itself!The plot is ridiculous, the screenplay is ridiculous, the assumptions are ridiculous and the finale' is ridiculous.  Not to mention the numerous songs that the characters keep breaking into every now and then.
There have been some good movies from India that at least had a decent and well-deserved chance at the Oscars -- Manthan, Pushpak, Nayakan, Salaam Bombay... (the last one was indeed nominated and deservedly so), but this movie is so trite that I feel the Oscars committee should really have reduced the field to four films if they didn't find anything else deserving a nomination."
"What I like:
Great scenes, great pictures, nice landscape: the movie looks good. Even the actors all have a memorable face, and look good on the camera.
The story idea is nice, to play a sport game Indians never played against long time British players. This makes it funny also to see those unconventional players.What I don't like:
However, the action is slow and not much happens. The storyline is very much predictable, no surprises. If you don't know Cricket rules, you will still be confused how to play this game.Overall conclusion:
It's a nice movie to look at, and you may have some pleasant moments, but it's not the kind of movie you can be much excited about and tell your friends to watch."
"This is pretty darn far from being subtle, indeed everyone here is a type (both the lovable and ornery but we-can-change-our-minds-via-song/dance Indians and the uppercrust British who use the word 'Bloody' in every sentence), but I enjoyed the corniness of it, and it's about a convoluted game so it gives the audience time to learn what its about... As far as can be expected. It's handsomely made, has some good (if standard) storytelling turns, and oh, the dance sequences are lovely and a lot fun to watch, especially scored to Rahman.A particularly not very strong point: the love ""triangle"" which doesn't make much sense when one of them, the white lady Elizabeth, can't speak the other's language, and so can't Bhuvan. But, that's what is simply done in these movies do you roll with it, or try to. Luckily, this gets pretty much jettisoned once the cricket matches come up, and it's then all about the sports movie hystrionics - which I also enjoyed (often against my better judgment), in large part because, well, it looks like they'll lose the game (BUT WILL THEY!??!)And damn does Aamir Khan (the, uh. Jack Nicholson of India? By that I mean great at comedy, drama, charming, fine at singing, and uh, ok not sure how Jack dances and all) have to act his ass off to make this work as our hero - certainly when our antagonist, played by Paul Blackthorne, seems to be cast because the producers said, ""we want Billy Zane... Oh, not available? Get his... Less pricey counterpart!"""
"The answer: kind of. Occasionally. But Lagaan is a very flawed film. I think the Sports Movie is probably the worst cinematic genre, in that there are really only two possible outcomes in the end. The underdogs either win or they lose. Both options have been so utterly overdone that a sports movie just can't really be very interesting. Add to that the fact that I know so little of cricket  if you don't, you probably should read up on the rules before you see Lagaan (like the fact that you can bean a batter without any penalty whatsoever)  and that promises a very dull movie. Fortunately, the film manages to be pretty entertaining all the way through. And since I personally broke it up into three different sittings, the length wasn't a big deal (if I had seen this in the theater, I very well might have despised it). It helps that the film is partly a musical. There are, I think, only six musical numbers, all of them good, a couple just fantastic (they get less impressive as the film goes on). The musical score of the film is also very good. And the (Indian) actors are all pretty good, with Gracy Singh (as Gauri) being an absolutely stunning beauty.  I hated the way that the British were portrayed, though. Yeah, I know, they were pretty awful to their subjects at this point of history. But they're so evil, they might as well be twirling their ever-present mustaches. And the more flamboyant the facial hair, the meaner they are. There is a lot of semi-frightening `I hope our gods break the backs of the Whiteys!' sentiment flying around the film, and Lagaan sometimes seems like a very hateful movie. It does very little to actually separate the past with the present, it seems to me. And then there's the white woman. She seems like she might have been added to apologize for the rest of the British characters (she has no facial hair), but she's so poorly written that all of her actions and appearances are laughable. And the semi-romantic relationship between herself and Bhuvan, the main Indian character, is an incredibly anachronistic and unbelievable conceit. Not much is even made of it, really, except for a particularly hilarious scene where she joins in during one of the better musical numbers. I don't particularly recommend Lagaan (you might want to buy the soundtrack, though, or download a couple of the songs), but many may like it much more than I did. 6/10."
"""Lagaan"" was a darling of the press; too bad; it's overrated.If you want to see art films from India, ripe with the magic that this film utterly lacks, view films by the master, Satyajit Ray.If you want to see a fun, expansive Bollywood flick, pick one with Amitabh Bachchan, ""Coolie,"" for example.If you want to see a movie with a powerful social conscience and incredible amounts of courage, check out ""Bandit Queen."" ""Lagaan"" is cartoonish and strictly for the middle brow.There are extensive singing and dancing numbers, performed by people who can't sing or dance, directed by a director without an eye for the body and its movements.When the film's star, Aamir Khan, moves his shoulders in a typical Indian dance move, he looks so uncomfortable you wonder if he's got a coat hanger stuck in his shirt.He looks like he's never made that prototypically Indian dance move before; given the theme of the movie, his apparent inauthenticity is inadvertently comical. Maybe the stiff British officer would perform the move with more grace and ease.This is such a shame. There is great dancing in India, with a centuries-long pedigree. If a movie is going to be seen before international audiences, and represent Indian dance, it should not be this.Other Bollywood movies wear their buffoonery lightly. ""Lagaan"" takes itself oh-so seriously.It wants to be an expose of the suffering of helpless peasants and the cruelty of the British Raj.Thing is, you can see real suffering, helpless peasants in India today. They are not suffering under the heel of the British Raj, they are suffering under the heel of Indian policies and cultural norms, like, oh, say, the caste system and misogyny. VS Naipaul had a lot to say about that ...But, anyway. Real life Indian peasants look nothing like the plump, immaculate, perfectly coiffed, sparkly-toothed stars of this movie.And that's a problem. You can't really make a gritty expose while banishing from your set the very visible throngs -- visible even to the most casual of tourists -- in any Indian street -- who looks even vaguely like the people whose plight you are dramatizing and wringing your hands over.Well, musicals aren't realistic, you might be saying.Well, I'd reply, musicals do feature the truth of great singing and great dance. When a performer with the talent of Paul Robeson belts out a song as great as ""Old Man River,"" you get the point being made about the plight of African Americans in the South, even if Robeson is on a soundstage, not on the banks of the Mississippi.No one in ""Lagaan"" can sing or dance, and there are no great songs in the movie. And Hollywood bothered to costume Paul Robeson in simple, torn clothing.The excruciatingly bogus peasants of ""Lagaan"" look like some very rich and privileged person's fantasy of what peasants ought to look like. They look like collectible international dolls, like something you'd purchase in an airport before departure. It's all very Potemkin-village-esquire.The Sadistic British Officer is utterly unbelievable. The audience looks at him and sees nothing but the filmmakers' pathetic political agenda. A more realistic character, once less flamboyant, painted and dyed, but more believable, could have been much more horrible.The movie wants to be Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" and ends up being a Warner Brothers' Road Runner v. Wile E. Coyote cartoon.Because it is so bogus, it is lifeless. ""Lagaan"" doesn't have the exuberant goofiness of less ambitious Bollywood movies. Those movies have their truth; their truth is the most extravagant dreams of their poorest viewers.""Lagaan"" is a politically correct dream, and, as such, it becomes an artistic nightmare.Some will like ""Lagaan,"" though. As mentioned, there are costumes galore, with nary a tear from long use or spot from buffalo dung. There are vapid musical numbers, unencumbered by any connection to organic life.Aamir Khan, the lead, is gorgeous, and he wears very little clothing, so you get to enjoy his gorgeousness in all its gorgeousness.Khan greatly resembles Tyrone Power. Khan looks like Power, he is as beautiful as Power was, and he has Power's absence of any apparent quality -- intelligence, physicality, depth -- other than great beauty.Gracy Singh is beautiful *and* a good actress. Let's hope she goes far. Far away from ""Lagaan."" There's a lot up on the screen. A Big Plot Device, scenery, and, oh, did I mention the costumes? Ultimately, though, given its complete divorce from either artistic excellence or the courses of real life, it's all pretty boring."
"Yes, I am from India, but I have much better ways to show my patriotism than calling this usual movie just with different setting as a great movie. Unlike posing as a non-Indian and flooding all oscar/film related forum with shameless posts on lagaan. Dont try to make a web coup just like, it was done to make Amitabh the actor of the millenium by BBC!.One new thing as a Indian film is that for first time its a sports film. You have all the usual features, villain's sister falling for the hero, a unwanted love triangle, a black sheep, over melodrama and what not?!.Any sensible cricket fan will know, when limited overs cricket was introduced (by 1971). There we have it about 100 years ago!. So much for details!. There is a limit for cinematic liberties. Detail flaws can pile up like Sachins tons here.I think we have seen may better underdog movies in hollywood, I dont know whats so new about this?!. Tell me about, self-determination and human spirit, I have seen it enough right from seven samurai. I dont need a crowd pleasing, over simplified film for this. Why not call Ajay Devgan kicking bad-guys can also called human spirit.Its a shame calling this the india's best. Agreed its a good film with good songs and some decent production qualities, but please keep your cool guys. First please, go and see some European and Hollywood movies to see what world movie standards are like. I am first a movie fan, then i am a indian movie fan. I dont accept this film as any better bollywood fare.
6/10."
"OK so it has sub titles and you have to read as you go. Who cares??!! Just watch the film it totally speaks for it's self. The music in this film is AMAZING! Phenomenal dance sequences. I love the sound track. Wish I could buy it. I can't speak the language and I still catch myself humming a favorite song or two. And the male lead in this movie.... What a hunk!! The female lead in the movie has an amazing singing voice. The only negative thing I can say is that some of the cricket scenes are really really long, and you can feel the summer heat of that field they're playing on. To whom it may concern there are people in the US that really need more Indian film ASAP! God Bless L"
"What an amazing film! Although a loooong film (over 3½ hours), my wife and I were nevertheless captivated by the variety and suspense. If you have never seen a Hindi film before, or if you are not in tune with Indian culture, then my advice is to have patience while watching the first 30 minutes or so. This is certainly not Hollywood, but 100% Bollywood - at its best! Although I live in a country with cricket only second to rugby, I do not like cricket and never watch it - but I did in fact enjoy the cricket in this film - my wife included.   Towards the end, there is a spiritual aspect of this film that brought tears to my eyes and radiance to my heart. Marvelous! There is not much more that I can add here (considering the many wonderful comments below) except to say that the romance and symbolism is a joy to see. Yes, there are some simplistic soap opera segments, but this is in fact a Bollywood film, so I embrace this difference and see it as wholesome and refreshingly moralistic. You will feel energised and elevated by this film. See it and spread the word. A message to Bollywood: ""More films like this - please!"""
"I've never been a fan of Bollywood movies, but I found ""Lagaan"" to be an enjoyable film.Of course, it isn't ""Two Women,"" ""The Bicycle Thief,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Umberto D"" or even on par with ""The Apu Trilogy"" and ""Salaam Bombay!"" (which, by the way, should have won the Oscar for best foreign film, instead of ""Pelle the Conqueror."") But not every film can be on par with these classics and life would be awfully boring if that were the case. Sometimes, you ought to be able to sit through a corny film and enjoy it - and that's what happens with ""Lagaan.""There's something delightfully infectious about ""Lagaan."" And although the running time is close to four hours, the time whizzes by.I was not bored by this film. It was a fun experience, the music has a jovial quality to it and the entire film is truly a thoroughly satisfying experience. If you want to see a ""The Bicycle Thief"" or ""Two Women,"" and that's the only type of film you want to see, then by all means see those masterpieces. But if you're in the mood for some diverting fun, watch ""Lagaan."" It is worth it."
"This movie was very well made and it looked fantastic with authentic costumes, locations and nice songs but the story and characters were one dimensional and cartoonish.  A bunch of misfit peasants beat the arrogant Brits at their own game with a 3-way love triangle woven in pretty much sums this movie up.  The ending is obvious from the very beginning and hence there isn't any suspense.  There is some petty infighting amongst the peasants along with some modern day political correctness thrown in about the caste system but in the end everyone in the village lives happily ever after.  I much prefer ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""American Desi."""
"I do not quite get the enthusiasm.  True enough, the film has very high production values -- it looks terrific and sounds great.  But to me, Lagaan is essentially a four-hour musical version of Bad News Bears that erroneously thinks is also a profound a political drama.  Also, the characters are rather one-dimensional, particularly the bad white folks. Perhaps I would not have been so irked if not for the nearly four-hour run time.  I have not seen much Bollywood, and I did find the cut-to-music-video scenes, coupled with fact that the actors are not singing their own songs (i.e., there is just one singer for all the women characters and one for the men) distracting, but I do not think that was the source of my discontent. I recently saw A Peck On the Cheek, which is also Bollywood, and I thought that movie was far superior to this one."
"Contains Spoiler Just another Hindi movie where the overtly good prevails over the overtly evil , in the most absurd circumstances. Regular Hindi movies feature a hero bashing up 10 hoodlums ( maybe multiplied by another 10 ). This one features 11 non-cricketers ( including physically and mentally handicapped guys ) , who defeat 11 Eglishmen at their own game. Of course , to make things realistic , they DID get trained in the finer skills of the game by an English woman !The story starts off with the English guys being cruel enough to levy some unbelievable taxes on the poor villagers. The they turn sadistic enough to challenge the poor villagers to a game of cricket , and if the villagers win , they get to TRIPLE the taxes. This is the start of absurdities ...leading to more than an hour of badly photographed cricket , and Englishwoman falling in love with one of the villagers who happens to look like a Bollywood star ( Aamir Khan ). Of course , the chocolate-faced Bollywood boy shuns her for the local village girl . This village girl , played by Gracy Singh , is the only breath of fresh air in this gigantic mess of a movie , replete with over-acting , misfit music and a totally predictable cricket match."
"I am tired of hearing about how this movie is supposed to be the greatest indian movie of all time. Its a very bad American movie that happens to be in Hindi with some badly dubbed songs. It needs a severe case of editing, and a much better sense of pace.Only two groups of people seem to like this movie a lot. The first group is Non-Indians who have never seen an Indian movie before and think of themselves as chic and cultured for liking this one.The other group that loves this movie is the 'Jai Hind' crowd, who are amazed that an Indian movie was actually made with technical competence (Note comments like 'amazing production values' or 'high quality prints') AND seen by non-Indians. They are the same Indians that think that the Sixth Sense is the greatest movie ever made; not because its actually a pretty cool movie (which it definitely is) but because it was directed by an Indian and appreciated by non-Indians.If you want to watch a trully great indian movie watch Pakeezah. You won't find it at Blockbuster, and you might need to dig a little, but it'll be worth it."
"Pretty actresses and charming musical scenes cannot save this Bollywood vehicle. This is cliched, unprofessional and nearly four hours. A four hour film is OK for a solid epic, not for a film about cricket. Believe it or not, the ""climactic"" cricket match in the end lasts for 70 minutes. The sport is ridiculous enough as it is, no need for a four-hour commercial.Rating - 3/10"
"I had rather high hopes for this. A high IMDb rating (8.3 for Lagaan) should at the same time never be seen as a guarantee (V for Vendetta, Rush, Ip Man to name just a few surprising above-8-ratings) and could be as deceptive as Academy awards nominations/winners. Im sure ratings and accolades accounts for something, but in some cases, it is hard to understand how a movie has grown to be generally accepted as a masterpiece. For me, Lagaan is such a film. The title (Once upon a time in India) and the length (244 min!) implies an epic. At the same time, the length is a double-edged sword. If musicals with an underdog sport story is not your thing ca 4h may prove to be quite a feat. I sat through this but did not like it much. I found it cheesy, sentimental and thought most characters where irritating. I guess the idea is you should sheer for the team of mistreated locals. One of the problems is that you never really feel that their situation is severe, since the film is so family oriented and polished...I'm sure a lot of people like Lagaan, there is a lot of proof for it. For me, it stands as one of many examples of mysteriously high-rated mediocrity."
"I was amused at the hype the film created amongst well-meaning Indians when it got nominated for the best foreign film Oscar and found entry into the Competition Section of Cannes in 2002. It was no mean achievement for an Indian film, in the perspective of the political and other forces that come into play in the long selection process. Yet, the film was inherently too weak to represent the best in Indian cinema. The strengths of ""Lagaan"" were: 1. Great sound (I do not imply music) recording and the split of the sound into six channels--one of the best in Indian cinema since ""Sholay""; 2. Commendable casting of Indian actors who are alumni of the National School of Drama, Delhi and the Film Institute, Pune--and not because they are sons and daughters of famous Indian actors or they won international beauty contests; 3. Good costumes; 4. Some good lilting songs with music of A R Rahman; and 5. authentic pronunciation.The weaknesses were: 1. Unrealistic photography--passing dark clouds that have sharp boundaries i.e., with an umbra and no penumbra, resembling shadows of sci-fi films like ""Independence day""; 2. A screenplay that ignores the development of secondary characters like Gauri, the British characters, and Indians who work for the British while these characters are utilized unabashedly and lackadaisically to burnish the main plot -- a look at the character development of tertiary characters of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns or Japanese cinema will show the lack of depth of Lagaan's screenplay; 4. Lack of detailed research on cricket rules of that era which any serious director would have done; 5. Inadequate and poor subtitling, with key lines left out and additional lines that appear that were never spoken; 6. A director who fumbles with editing and camera perspectives on the deer and rabbit sequences and forgets to capture the ""no-balls"" of bowlers on camera, 7 Uninspired editing ... the list is endless.A modest production like Shyam Benegal's ""Ankur"" or any Adoor Gopalakrishnan's later films would have won an Oscar because these films take direction, screenplay, photography, editing and sound seriously to a level beyond the obvious importance the producers of ""Lagaan"" gave to the story and acting. Unfortunately, the films of Benegal and Gopalakrishnan were never sent to the Oscars by the Indian organizations that choose the representative Indian film to vie for an Oscar..Yet ""Lagaan"" is a good Indian film excelling in certain departments but is definitely not a patch on the best Indian cinema today. A film of Mrinal Sen (later period), Gopalakrishnan, Benegal, or Karnad offer better cinema than ""Lagaan""--though none of these filmmakers could afford the monetary and technological advantage in the hands of the producers of ""Lagaan.""I commend the performances of some players such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajesh Vivek and Sri Vallabh Vyas in their poorly developed roles. These are great actors on stage but cinema unfortunately has resorted to casting them as stereotypes. I wish these three are picked up by accomplished directors and given an opportunity to express their talent in complex roles. Then they would give the Amir Khans a run for their money and prove acting skills of trained Indian actors further. British actress Rachel Shelley was refreshing to watch and may develop into an accomplished actress."
"Lagaan. It's not everyday affair when something like Lagaan happens. When Bollywood entered the new millennium, it was still craving for a turning point which takes Bollywood to international stage. Ashutosh Gowariker came with an idea which defies Bollywood norms by leaps and bounds, Aamir Khan is hooked by the idea as an actor and takes the risky decision of producing the movie on its own so that idea gets the much deserved heart felt treatment and what happened later is a history now. Lagaan year after year is considered the Bollywood's bravest effort of the new millennium.In its unbelievable plot where our hero a villager played by Mr. perfectionist Aamir Khan accepts the challenge of egoist British Commander Officer to play a cricket match in which if village wins, they need not to pay taxes for next three years. Even with a run time of 3 hours and 40 minutes, movie never gets out of steam, in fact gets better with every passing moment. An array of colorful characters played by credible actors, the mesmerizing music and back ground score of maestro A.R.Rahman, soulful lyrics of Javed Akhtar, a water tight screenplay with not a single out of the place scene and the genuine feeling of honesty and simplicity, all these factors make Lagaan an outstanding movie of modern times. First half is a smooth journey of introducing characters, the challenge, the team making and the match preparation. Second half is a like watching a nail biting cricket match. The movie is a perfect example that with full commitment and hard work, Bollywood can create the international level cinema with ease.Lagaan turned out to be an inspiration for audience and its makes alike. After Lagaan, Aamir Khan appeared into Taare Zameen Par, Rang De Basanti and 3 Idiots. Ashutosh made Swades and Jodhaa Akbar. I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for Lagaan. It's a sin for any movies fan to miss Lagaan."
"Not that the Oscars themselves are always right or always pick the best films but this movie just isn't that good. Sure cricket may be an obsession in India but that does'nt mean that a bunch of villagers can become professional cricketers overnight. That is the biggest flaw in this movie. And how the hell can they get trained in cricket by an englishwoman? How is it that the hero can become such a great and consistent batsman in such a short period? It just isn't realistic and believable enough despite the great production values. It seems that none of the characters had a shred of self respect, the way they portrayed themselves. However, there are plenty of other plus points to make this movie highly watchable for a non Indian. The British cast are excellent in this movie.India has produced plenty of movies actually capable of winning the Oscars but this is just not one of them. Go see stuff like ""Black"" instead."
"There have been hundreds of good reviews and comments on this movie, and I must say that I agree with almost everything that has been said about it. So I'm not going to patronize it anymore, because everyone already knows how great it is. But I did find a couple of negative points in the movie. Things that were either silly or unnecessary. What were they? I felt that the whole romantic angle between Elizabeth and Bhuvan was completely useless and could have been avoided completely. Why couldn't Elizabeth have wanted to help them purely out of the goodness of her heart? In fact, after their first meeting when the villagers are observing the cricket match in hiding, Elizabeth asks their names, and after they've left, she actually whispers ""Bhuvan"" to herself... as if she's already falling for him.. ridiculous! In fact, i thought the whole Bhuvan/Elizabeth/Gauri triangle was useless and did nothing for the plot. yes, it gave a chance for our ""Gori Mem"" to sing a song, but come on!! The last few words in the movie claim that Elizabeth never married, and is referred to by Amitabh Bachchan (the narrator) as her remaining Bhuvan's Radha forever. A little laughable."
