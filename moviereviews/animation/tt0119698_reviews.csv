"This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again."
"I saw Mononoke Hime on its USA release back in late December 1999 under its U.S. title Princess Mononoke.  I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie.  The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well.  It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today.  Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.  This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.  Even my wife who holds a strong prejudice against Japanese animation enjoyed this movie.Go and see this movie.  You won't be disappointed."
"The first time I saw Princess Mononoke I was completely moved and surprised. Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn't a ""they all lived naively ever after"" film. There were no complete ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki's films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka's romance and Moro's views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.Like many Miyazaki movies, the animation (as always) is wonderful and nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine Disney films lack (thank goodness for Studio Ghibli). The music was beautiful and well suited to the movie.The only predicament to the movie is that it is a bit downbeat and does not contain much happy laughter (oh well, I can watch My Neighbor Totoro - also a good movie - for happy laughter.).10/10 - And my favourite movie of all time."
"Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke! America: SEE IT!"
"Fantastic film! It makes me speechlessly. Good dialogs, beautiful soundtrack,incredible animation effects (take a look at the rain, at the movement of the grass, hear the sounds of the steps) and interesting characters,who are everything but ordinary. Ashitaka is captivating (what a strength, what a heart, what a soul!); San (the Princess Mononoke herself) is intriguing; and Lady Eboshi is ambiguous -is she the villain? I don't think so. After all, who can blame her? Don't let the over exploration of themes related to ecology discourage you. Go ahead and watch Mononoke. It's a totally new way of treating the conflict between men and nature, which is far from its ending. Definitely, a jewel among the predictable animations of Disney and Pixar's also predictable jokes. There are no jokes here. TAKE A LOOK AT IT!"
"I saw this film in Japan, in Japanese with no sub-titles, I don't speak a word of the language and I was still enthralled!  It is Miyazaki most visually intense (surpassing, at long last, Nausicaa) and is alive with color and movement the like not yet seen in anime.The story is complex, and after talking with Japanese friends, it is clear that much of it went over my head (particularly that relating to specific Japanese myths), but the important elements came through. Miyazaki's long infatuation with technology verses nature and man's relation to God (or gods) weave throughout the film as does his trend for strong women characters. Even with the language barrier, the film is of such intense emotion that it caries you through to the end. The change in dynamic between the crashing fight scenes and the quiet scenes of healing by the lake is so broad and so well paced that I can't remember a film where my emotional state was so expertly varied.If you have a chance to see this film, in any language, I recommend you do."
"I have seen many many animated features, but none compare to the talent that is shown in this anime. After seeing this for the first time, I could see why so many animators (especially disney animators) consider Mr. Miazaki a GOD! His animation style has the best ""flowing motion"" I have ever seen.The American dubbing team, whoever they are did an excellent job picking voices, they got top notch actors to do the job right (unlike most animes today). They even took on the hair-pulling task of RE-ANIMATING the mouth movements to match!This is by far one of the best films I have ever seen."
"Im a Big fan of Miyazaki... This movie is Definitely in his top 3... Princess Mononoke's story is very in depth and it grabs your attention. Time after time. You may have to watch it a couple times to catch everything but you will fall in love with the characters and story every time you sit down to watch itAs for the art... Its Visually stunning yet again. Everything is depicted so well in Miyazaki's artwork from the humans to the Forest gods and everything in betweenthis definitely worth watching.And if you like it you should definitely check out some of his others like Castle In The Sky, Howls Moving Castle and Spirited Away"
"In its theatrical Japanese release of 1997, PRINCESS MONONOKE was the hugest box office grossing movie of all time in the land of the Rising Sun until it was overtaken by James Cameron's TITANIC, and, four years later, director Hayao Miyazaki's own SPIRITED AWAY. No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real ""hero"" or ""villain"") trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.This is not a movie for young children, as there are disturbing shots of decapitations, amputations, and occasional blood spurts. Sometimes these elements of violence turn squeamish viewers away from Anime (especially when they're done gratuitously), but Hayao Miyazaki presents it not to sicken people but to show it for the horror that it is (plus, in this film, the violence is not overdone). Take, for example, the scene where the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka of the Emishi Tribe, possessed by a curse he received from killing a Demon God (in trying to protect his village), tries to stop samurai attacking innocent people, and in doing so shoots the arms off of one man, and, later, takes off a man's head with two arrows. The sight is horrifying to see, but the deed also increases Ashitaka's demon mark on his arm, which is slowly preparing to take his life. This is a truly horrible depiction about the dangers of violence.Also worth noting is Princess Mononoke herself, a human girl named San raised by the Animal Gods, and her struggle against Lady Eboshi of Iron Town, who is destroying the forest merely for her people's own good (the folks are outcasts, including lepers and prostitutes). San distrusts and despises all humans, and is especially determined to destroy them all (particularly Eboshi)... or die trying. When she's rescued by Ashitaka, however, a conflict within her begins to surface: are *all* humans evil, or is there at least one who is trustworthy? If there is any character who could be considered a villain, it would be the monk, Jigo, who wants the head of the Spirit of the Forest to bring to the Emperor. Such a deed would destroy the entire forest (as we find out in the film's chilling climactic scenes) but even Jigo has his own motives, too. He is not so much evil as much as he is just ""trying to get by"". This pretty much sums up the conflicts between all our characters here.PRINCESS MONONOKE may not have enjoyed similar box office success here in America, but at least a lot of work and care went into the translation. As with Disney's other English language tracks for Miyazaki's films, this one is very, very well done. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman worked on the script, rewording it only to a) fit the mouth flaps, and b) make it understandable to a non-Japanese audience who would probably not comprehend a lot of the cultural nuances found in this film. Added to which, the voice cast includes a commendable list of stars; Billy Crudup is perfect as Ashitaka, eliciting just the right amount of warmth, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and courage, while Claire Danes delivers passionately angry, conflicted turmoil to San. (Folks said she was miscast, but I beg to differ; her character is *required* to be outraged and aggressive, and Danes does have a strong voice to carry such emotions.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (a grossly underrated performance; his Southern drawl adds to the character), Minnie Driver (elegant choice!) as Lady Eboshi, Gillian Anderson as the Wolf-Goddess Moro, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as the friendly (if no-nonsense style) worker Toki. The translation flows smoothly to those who are not familiar with Japanese folk tales, and the story succeeds in making its point, too.This movie may not be for everybody, as it is the kind of film that may disturb young children, but older audiences will find themselves absorbed in the artwork, which showcases gorgeous, unmatched imagination, from the finely detailed forests to the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will to the Forest Spirit itself -- a huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes. And at night he becomes a ghostly specter known as the Nightwalker, traveling higher than the trees. Such images warrant the purchase of this film. Better yet, its message is not too preachy, and rarely do animated movies (save those from Japan) showcase characters portrayed as, well, human beings."
"Studio Ghibli has been Japan's leading anime Production Company since the 1980's, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic ""Princess Mononoke"".The film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe's wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka's efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side's bid for allegiance.""Princess Mononoke"" is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki's best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, ""Mononoke"" has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters' nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli's other works, which were aimed mostly at children.Of course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film's wonder, because Miyazaki's true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of ""Princess Mononoke"" is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi's music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.Overwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg's ""E.T."", ""Princess Mononoke"" became Japan's No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere."
"A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection of movies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I have forced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at the entire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the world be like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?"
"When I first saw 'Princess Mononoke' on Christmas eve back in 2006 I was 10 years old and couldn't really follow the story since I was quite disturbed from the explicit graphic content. Especially the giant pig suffering of a demonic disease scared the hell out of me back than. But never less is knew that this movie is something special, something I have never seen before. Since then I became a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and watched nearly everything they have produced. But still 'Princess Mononoke' stands out to me as their best work and to me is Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece. The topic of this movie is just as simple as complex. It's the fight between human culture coming with the technologic industry versus the nature and its variety of animals living in it and to this day it's a pretty relevant topic. The way both sides are portraied in this movie is just beautiful. Miyazaki manages to show both sides with all their strength and weaknesses. There's no good side or bad side. Instead every side can be understood by the viewer and even if you don't agree with their opinions you still are able to see why each side acts like they do. The visual work is top notch like always with Studio Ghibli. I love how they create a feeling for nature as one whole organism. I really recommend everyone to go watch this movie. To me this is one of the best movies ever created."
"I'm so thrilled that I decided to watch Princess Mononoke for the first time ever on the big screen. Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today. (Verdict: A)"
"Up until a certain point i regarded spirited away as Miyazaki's masterwork and my favorite of his filmography; Spirited Away is still his best and Miyazaki at his peak, but Princess Mononoke has resonated with me like a film never has. From the opening narration provided by Keith David to the final shot of San and Ashitaka in the field together, the film is perfect in every sense of the word. The soundtrack alone, composed by the immensely talented Joe Hisaishi, is completely cinematic and transportive. What adds to the greatness of this movie is how un-miyazaki it is, considering how, for lack of a better term, family friendly the rest of his films are; this one is a sharp, but welcomed departure. With thematic elements of war and conflict between the preservation of nature and the advancement of human civilization, Miyazaki does not downplay the severity and importance of these elements and injects his genius into it as he does. The characters are nothing to laugh at either as they are layered as you'd expect a studio Ghibli character to be, you have an exiled prince looking to relieve himself of a curse cast onto him by a demon while trying to act as a peace keeper between man and nature, a girl who was abandoned at birth that was adopted by a forest deity and acts as a primary point of interaction between the humans and nature, and a well intentioned matriarch who saves women in this world from brothels and is a pioneer in the advancement of human civilization, and the list goes on. I would be remiss if i did not talk about how gorgeous this film is animated, there are stills in this that if i just took it out of the film, framed it, and placed it in the middle of a prestigious art museum it would not look out of place. I've lost count at the amount of times I've seen this film and i am still enamored by it."
"This magnificent cartoon movie concerns Japanese legends , it begins when Ashikata, a prince warrior is wounded by a cursed giant boar . He attempts to encounter some way to heal incurable curse inflicted . Ashikata saddled in his red deer goes to the east, where finds the Iron Town , ruled by Lady Ebosi confronting Sam , the princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves . Ashikata encounters in the middle of fighting among the forest animals : large wolves, giant boars and humans : emperor Mikado soldiers , Lady Ebosi soldiers and Shogun army . Furthermore, in the forest finds the deer god and spirits called Kodamas .This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, drama, spectacular combats and with ecological message . The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and quite entertaining, though isn't apt for small kids but contains graphic violence . It's a deep critical about nature exploiting and killing the forests for the encroaching civilization represented by an iron mining town that cause a damage environment . This stunning film, though a bit too long, converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world. The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki , he personally corrected or redrew more than 80,000 of the film's 144,000 animation cels . Being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician , Joe Hisaishi. Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Howl's moving castle¨ , ¨Chihiro¨ , ¨Porco Rosso¨ and ¨My neighbour Tororo¨ . Rating : Sensational and fantastic , it's a masterpiece cartoon movie."
"Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by animation, I watched way too many cartoons and would often drawn them myself. I never thought of animation as ""real art"" or anything fancy, just one of life's simple pleasures. Sure Disney had made some ground-breaking animated features, and technology was allowing for more and more detailed and intricate animation techniques, but no animated film had ever moved me as much as a Godfather or Unforgiven or Dr. Strangelove, that is until one fine day in 1999. I was in high school, and Princess Mononoke was premiering at the Coolidge Theater in Brookline, I was pumped as I really enjoyed Castle in the Sky and Totoro, so I went to the theater with a few friends and was absolutely clown away for this. This film is so spectacular in almost every way and every piece comes together perfectly. The animation is top-notch, not that shoddy 1980's anime style, but the mind-blowing animation techniques that made Miyazaki the maestro his is today. The score by Joe Hisaishi is tremendous, though at times it may seem a bit overly dramatic (I mean this is an animated feature, not Lawrence of Arabia), but this is the ultimate animated epic, so it fits in well. The plot is dense and the characters are well-developed, there are no true ""good"" or ""bad"" guys in this film...and Miyazaki includes his favorite underlying theme of Man vs. Nature throughout. Some may argue that Spirited Away was Miyazaki's crowning achievement, but I believe that Mononoke Hime is his true Masterpiece."
"I just thought its just the another kid stuff before I saw that movie. But I am really in shock and all my attention sink to the movie when I watch it . I drop my mouth down and I really can't speak while I was watching this Mononoke and Ashitaka nightmare adventures until the end.After enjoy watching the movie, I got many thoughts, philos and knowledge of what we are living for and what we believe in. In this movie, for my point of view, nobody is a bad guy and a good guy.Everyone live on what they believe in and express on they are living for. All the characters have different strength and different way of living but they all are same in just one thing, its called ""HOPE"".They live what they hope for and eager on what they believe. I would nearly cry as the climax is on way too high and after that this story of all meanings is about war and peace, love and hate, positive and negative. Its totally what its called ""master-piece of ART"" and many appreciate to everyone who create this."
"I have never been a big fan of anime, but two weeks ago i saw Spirited Away on television. I can admit that i was stunned. It was so much more beautiful then the Disney/Pixar movies. After i had seen Spirited Away i tried frantically to find Princess Mononoke on the internet.Princess Mononoke is a story about a prince named Ashitaka. He goes on a journey to find a cure for Tatarigami's curse. On the journey he finds himself in the middle of a war between a human Iron-town and the gods of the woods. He also meets Princess Mononoke, a girl who is raised by wolves and is filled with hate against humans.I think Princess Mononoke was even better than Spirited Away. It outclasses its Hollywood-synonym, Lord Of The Rings. The plot is very good. The soundtrack is amazing, it's a shame that the Academy Award didn't notice it. The animation is beautiful, especially the characters. The only thing i can complain about is the English dubbing. Billy Crudup does a splendid job as the voice of Ashitaka, but they could really have chosen a better alternative than Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo.Overall i give this movie 9 out of 10."
"This is one the best movies Hayao Miyazaki has ever made. Absolutely wonderful job. The plot was at first a bit confusing, this is a movie that you have to watch more than twice: Its hard to get at first.With beautiful backgrounds, carefully chosen seiyuus, Mononkoe Hime entertains both adults and kids.The first time I watched Princess Mononoke, I was a bit confused about the characters. I wasn't sure what was going on, and who was this movie about again, who is this ""Mononoke Hime"". But as I watched this movie over and over again, the plot started opening, and I began to understand and realize things I didn't notice before. I have always loved the way Miyazaki draws his characters expressions. Unlike some other anime movies I've seen, Miyazakis characters are more easier to read. And this is where the difference of reality and cartoons steps in. Its easy to overdo your characters expressions, and so spoil the movie, and make it look stupid, even childish. This isn't a mistake that Miyazaki would do. A big bonus for that!Mononkoe Hime surpasses even the famous ""Nausicaa, the valley of the wind"". Im totally impressed!"
"This animated Japanese-style film follows a young boy through the forest to rid himself of a curse. The film is about Nature and humans and the gods of all things. The young boy tracks down Princess Mononoke to help him. The film is beautifully animated and enjoyable. It also has some good insights about the culture and showing the important balance (or imbalance) between humans and Nature. It has some good lessons to learn here. This is a film that can be enjoyed and sets itself above many of the other animations coming out these days. It's serious, yet it is refined; it does have a refined sense of humour in a couple of places. I recommend it."
"If, like me, your heart sinks at the prospect of another pious, sanctimonious, tub-thumping eco-fable, give ""Mononoke Hime"" a chance all the same. It does have a distinct, and far from subtle, ecological message, of the ""can't we just live together?"" variety, but on the other hand it's far from clear that the answer the film suggests is ""yes"", and there are plenty of nuances and subtleties along the way. More to the point, there's a proper story, well-conceived and well told, there's a memorable, beautiful and violent world, credible characters and a good deal of charm.The animation is mostly very fluent and careful, though not flashy in the way we're getting used to in this CG age. (""Mononoke"" uses cgi, but subtly and with restraint, so that the feel remains that of a group of traditional craftsmen under one guiding hand). Quite often one finds that there are more static elements in a tableaux than you'd expect in a Disney animated feature, but I think this is an aesthetic choice rather than a mere economy: it stylizes and formalizes, while focussing attention on the important elements in the frame. But there is occasional jerkiness, though not enough to detract seriously, and perhaps it wouldn't trouble audiences whose frame of reference isn't so western as mine - I'm not sure.Talking of the western and eastern sensibilities, the Region 2 DVD which I'm reviewing gives you a choice of English and Japanese dialogue, and though I watched the American dub first, I'd generally prefer the Japanese version, for the key roles of Ashitaka and San. Billy Crudup is appealing but too low-key, and Clare Danes strikes me as badly miscast: she sounds a bit too old, and altogether too urban to bring out the core of wildness or the steely sense of loyalty to her world. Like other reviewers, I have trouble with the Texas drawl of Billy Bob Thornton, which is just too regionally specific to match the look of the character (please understand that I'm not suggesting the cast should all have done fake Japanese accents!). On the other hand, it's pretty much a toss-up between Yuko Tanaka and Minnie Driver (who's very closely attuned to the aesthetic of the original) as Eboshi, and Gillian Anderson and Jada Pinkett Smith are just right. Still, overall you get more vividness and conviction from the original voice cast.  Oddly, the lip-sync seems more approximate in the Japanese version, perhaps a fault in the synchronization on the R2 DVD.  The subtitles unfortunately but understandably come from Neil Gaiman's adaptation of the screenplay rather than re-translating the Japanese - one's aware, for example, that Gaiman has added bits of extra, explanatory dialogue.With all that out of the way, let's concentrate on what makes the film work: it delineates a world that's at once mythological and believable, and refuses to sentimentalize or simplify (even if it occasionally allows itself to preach).  There are feuds and failures of trust not just between the humans and the animals, but within each world - and the animals seem as ready as the humans to exclude the other from their world. Indeed the conceit of the film seems to be that language, rather than being a product of distinctly human evolution, was originally shared among mammals at least, and it's as the war with the humans goes on that the animal kingdom becomes more brutish and less coherent. For all the prince's idealism and the delicate rapprochement some of the characters inch towards, one gets the impression that the logic of conflict will be hard to resist.Perhaps the most appealing and intriguing element in this world is the kodoma: the little, voiceless tree-spirits seem to be a cross-between a mushroom, a toddler and a rattle, and I defy anyone not to be captivated by them."
"When he is touching by a demon while defending his village, Ashitaka is sent out to the West, from where the crazed demon originated, seeking a cure for the demon infection that will otherwise kill him.  However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Town's iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of it's trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that.  This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness.  The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai).  However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away.  The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it.  The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying.  I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters.  However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka.  Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her.  Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast.  Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast.  I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast.  Driver is OK but her character wasn't.  Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work.  Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added).  Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai.  Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki.  It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is!  It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids' animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of it's weaknesses.  The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices aren't that good.  The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story.  Despite this, it is still a wonderful film and easily one of the best animations I have seen."
"Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends."
"Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time, and is up there with Studio Ghibli's best along with Spirited Away. I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"I can watch this movie over and over. I love the art, the story and the characters."
"I have a long history with this movie. When I was about 7 I caught it on tv late at night and was interested but didn't know what was happening. I was traumatized by the violence and scary images. I legitimately had nightmares! So I avoided this movie for years. But, nearly 15 years later and I am a big Studio Ghibli fan. I knew I had to watch it. I was not disappointed.
The story of the movie has the feel of a Tolkien epic. A prince goes on a journey to lift a curse off of him. He meets spirits, gods, a town of outcasts and more. The plot is brilliantly put together and tight. There is no wasted moment. The characters are all well written and developed. There's a lot of ambiguity in the film. No character is a stock character and their motives could be easily commended or condemned. I think this leaves the viewer to interpret how they feel.
The animation is so beautiful. Over 100,000 drawings were used in the film. It's colorful, vibrant and feels alive. It screams animated masterpiece.
There's something about Ghibli films that give you a certain feeling. Kinda like what you get when you watch a great classic Disney film. I can't quite put my finger on what the feeling is. Not quite nostalgic, but it's a good feeling nonetheless.
There's so much to talk about. If you love Japanese animation, or just animation in general, then this is a must see! Be warned though! This can be a very violent movie. If you want your younger kids to see a Ghibli film then try My Neighbor Totoro or Ponyo. But once their older, show them this film. Believe me, it's worth every moment."
"I'm not a huge fan of anime, so I'm not the best person to review this film. Nonetheless I found myself watching it to find out what all the fuss was about.Initially, I found the film gripping. The old-fashioned animation felt fresh and I loved watching the colourful panoramas play out on screen. The early scenes involving the terrible forest monster chasing the film's hero were vivid and exciting; then Princess Mononoke is introduced.Gradually, I lost interest in the film. I found the story far too slim to support the lengthy running time. Myriad characters are introduced and underdeveloped, and the emphasis seems to be on repetitive action involving the different factions battling each other. Certain sequences are certainly captivating on the animation front - especially the huge, translucent forest god creature - but the story just didn't keep my attention."
"Disney animation has linear detail, economical drawing, and extremely sophisticated motion.  In a word, it's classical.  Japanese animation has vertical detail, heavily etched backdrops that verge on being overdesigned, but rudimentary motion.  Japanese animation is baroque.  (Disney cartoons tend to have better draftsmanship, but this is inessential to the difference in style.)  The styles could hardly be more fundamentally opposed, and you like either one or the other.  It's hard to have a strong taste for both. To lay my cards on the table, I like the Disney style: I consider it more subtle and versatile, and at its best it lives and breathes like no other kind of animated image.  Still, the Japanese style has its strengths.It's essentially a static art: silence and stillness are what it conveys best.  It's interesting to compare ""Mononoke"" with ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  The latter film is unusual for Disney in that silence and stillness are used with surprising frequency, but the effect is always unstable: stillness is a kind of dissonance, something requiring resolution. The moments of silence and stillness in ""Mononoke"" are consonant and complete in themselves.  There are some lovely static tableaux in which the dialogue - if there is any - has as much time as it needs to breathe.The Japanese style is also good at conveying a sense of place.  (Disney can do this also, but neither as quickly nor as economically.)  Usually it's an urban place.  Think of definitive anime, and most Westerners think of ""Akira"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"", which are very urban indeed.  (My personal favourite in the genre is ""The Crimson Pig"", which, if not quite so urban, is heavily technological.)  ""Mononoke"" is different.  Most of the action takes place in the untamed, and I mean untamed, wilderness; now and then we enter a village.  Surprisingly, even these settings are solidly realised.  A single drop of water falls from a pine tree and lands on someone's face, and at once we feel that we are in the middle of a dense, damp, green forest.The story is deeply weird, in the best Japanese tradition - in particular, in the tradition of this particular director - and intensely sad.  The hero's quest is fulfilled, in a sort of a way, but the film does not end in triumph.  Instead of thinking ""good, X happened"", we think, ""oh well, at least X happened"".  -I must admit I was surprisingly unmoved.  Something about ""Mononoke"" distanced me; it may have been the facelessness of the central hero, it may have been the overall style; if the latter, it may have been entirely my fault, which is why I'm unwilling to commit myself to any kind of criticism.  All I know is that, much as I admired parts of ""Mononoke"", I am unable to love it."
"Spoilers herein.The first thing I want is to be transported. The further the better, the more competently the better. This film transported me. It had quite a bit different take on the world -- heavihanded, confusing, illogical, juvenile mysticism, pop morality -- all different than what we are usually served up. Some of this strangeness (I am convinced) is because the director is a poor storyteller.Disney's ethic was that the simplicity in the art corresponded with a simplicity in the story, so much so that one could turn off the sound and get the story. Not just follow the story but follow the WHOLE story. Anime seems to want to turn that on its head, making the animation simpler than anything out of Disney, but blowing up the story complexity with so many threads that kids believe it is profound.No matter for me, the confusion and pseudodepth was part of the experience.But there is another element here, and that really did disappoint me. 'Akira' was genuinely artistic, not so much in the drawings themselves, but in the understanding of motion. I was impressed with how the edges on the screen corresponded to the edges between scenes. Akira had a similarly childish sense of the complexly profound, but the art showed mastery and self-awareness.The vision in this film is just plain unimaginative in how the motion is handled. I'm not talking about the quality of the animation (which is poor), but the depth of the art. And the images themselves lack imagination: a wormy boar as a demon; the nightwalker was straight out of scoobydoo; the wolfgods?; the smurfy sprites? None of this reaches deep.If you want an introduction to anime and are looking for art, go to 'Akira.' Don't even stop here."
"I would never say that I hate anime, but I am usually bored and confused by it. So much anime acts thoughtful and deep, but ends up being fairly shallow and simple (see: Neon Genesis and Death Note). Miyazaki has always been a person I could turn to for anime that is both fun AND thought-provoking. Please understand that I am as surprised as you are when I say that I really didn't like this movie.Now, I don't hate Mononoke. I enjoyed the spectacle, and I recognize that it is very well-made. The story is competently told and the setting is interesting.My problem is with the characters. No one in Mononoke acts like a human being. The prince is a perfect angel who isn't affected by human emotions like fear and greed. He is utterly flawless and boring. I mean sure, he's been cursed, but it doesn't really seem to do much to him. In fact, it only appears to make him stronger. What's he complaining about?The women of Irontown are the most hateful people I could possibly imagine. After the attack, one of them joked, ""If you hadn't been there, we'd all have to find ourselves new husbands."" That's really funny, except to all of the women whose husbands are actually DEAD. What sort of callous, spiteful monster would say something like that? And worse, who would laugh at such an inappropriate joke? That same lady's husband was pushed off a cliff, almost died, and struggled for days to return home to his wife. When he finally makes it back home, what does she do? He calls him a dumbass and berates him in front of everyone. ""I wish the wolves had eaten you! Then maybe I could've found a real husband."" What a heartless bitch! There is no sense of love or camaraderie from anyone. I don't believe that these two have ever actually loved each other.I could understand this if the animals were portrayed sympathetically. They are not. All of the animals are rather dickish about eating and destroying everything in their path. The people of Irontown are only trying to defend themselves and they are made out to be the villains. Sure, they're destroying the forest, but it doesn't appear like the rest of the world is all that bad; just this place.In fact, the only person in the movie who I actually liked was Lady Obashi, the evil gun-toting power-hungry psychopath. Sure, she wanted to rule the world, but she felt like a human being. She was kind to the lepers, took pity on the whores and gave them all new and rewarding jobs. She loved her people and wanted to protect them. But she's supposed to be the villain? I don't buy it.And what about the pig? I understand that the first pig turned into a demon because he was filled with rage, but what about the old pig? The last thing he felt was hope that all of his warriors were still alive. Why did he become a demon when he wasn't full of hate? For that matter, all of the other animals WERE full of hate. All of the wolves, the monkeys, and most of the pigs were hateful, vengeful bastards. Why didn't they turn into demons? It doesn't make any sense.Perhaps the depth of this movie has been lost on me. Perhaps Miyazaki is trying to say that war can make a monster out of anyone, no matter how noble his cause. I suppose that would make for an interesting film, but I don't feel like that's what Miyazaki was trying to say. As it currently stands, I think that this is Miyazaki's weakest film."
"Princess Mononoke is a story of adventure and yet love too. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did! My brother loves anime and showed me Spirited Away, Final Fantasy, and Princess Mononoke. From then on I loved anime. Anime always has good animation and is usually interesting. If you are a true fan you will like this movie. This, to me, is one of Miyazaki's best movies. I hope he continues to make these movies and animate and design. Although there is a rumoor going around saying he's retiring. Miyazaki is the best anime director for me. Someday I hope you appreciate anime as much as I do. Thank you and God speed."
"The *cinematography*: wind blown prairies and lakes, morning sunlight filtering through the forest, sudden, brief mountain showers: Hiroshigi as an animator! Too bad they didn't work in a snow scene too; the Emishi lived in the north of Japan which gets plenty of snow.Iridescent dragon flies.San pre-chewing food for Ashitaka: moving and erotic.The Great Forest Spirit/Deer God as the Night Walker: Liquid Godzilla.Vegetation springing up in footsteps of the Great Forest Spirit and butterflies feeding in the tracks afterward.The Great Forest Spirit's pool and the islets within: a graveyard littered with bones.Dead Kodamas falling from the trees like autumn leaves.One objection: The apes. They appear in three separate animation styles, the first two being well below the standards of the rest of the movie. Only in their last scene are they even convincingly apes, although even then they are not the right kind of ape. Japanese macaques are instantly recognizable with their bright pink faces and bushy gray-blond hair."
"There aren't words describing how much this movie means to me. The first time i watched this movie i was not myself, but it would change my view on life forever! Miyazaki's Masterpice Princess Mononoke is packed with incredible music, amazing anime, vise dialogs, and an extreeeeemly good story!: Humans against nature and its animals! It shows in beautiful characteristics haw much damage mankind does to nature simply by being humans, and way to many! This story takes place in a time long ago when there were few humans and gods roamed the earth. now there are even more of us, and gods have become humble beast for us to kill, stalk and eat. I eat beef and i love it! don't get me wrong! after you see this film and more of Miyazakis films like ""Nausicaä of the valley of the winds"" or Takeshi Kitanos ""Pom Poko"" i hope you will take another look at the world like i have and see like i see! thanks to this movie! ""....and a little help from my friends..."" ;)"
"... despite much has been made of Neil Gaiman's dubbed lines, you should absolutely watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The dubbing actors seem not to completely understand the intonations their characters' lines require, which, to me, made the first 20 minutes rather confusing. It was only when I switched to Japanese that it all seemed to make sense. Don't ask me why, like I said I guess it's intonation. Furthermore, it's always daft not to see a movie in its original language. And that goes for anime too, unless you still believe it's not real film.But this is! OK, we've seen the story about nature vs humans before (after all, is that not what the Arthur / Merlin / Morgana / Mob legends are all about?), but what makes this one stand apart is 2 things: 1. no one is all good or all evil; 2. the visuals are stunning and testify of an imagination unbound by logic. These 2 points are crucial, for it is there that most Disney films or plain Hollywood films go wrong - one could say that they're made by 5 year olds. But no, it's just the reverse! Most Disney animation and Hollywood stuff is made by 'soundly reasoning' adults with an emotional life not reaching beyond love and hate, motivational insight not going beyond revenge (or getting laid) and an imagination enslaved to logic. This film isn't, and as a consequence some call it 'difficult'. And not suitable for children. Let me tell you, 5 year olds have, with their boundless imagination, no difficulty getting into this.This film is just so good it's hard to believe someone just sat down at a table, wrote the thing and then drew it on a piece of paper.** Addition ** I've recently read the Nausicaa anime, and it becomes even clearer now that Mononoke is Miyazaki's re-take on his Nausicaa film (which was premature even in its full-length format), with Nausicaa split in two over Ashitaka & San. However, though this is obviously Miyazaki's second best (after Laputa), it remains difficult to pour all the complex musings about man's relationship to nature in 2 hours (the Nausicaa manga is over a 1000 pages long and took him 13 years; when it was finished he made Mononoke). Hence, some things (like Ashitaka helping out Eboshi even after she's done such evil deeds) have left some viewers bewildered. In all, I found the persona of Nausicaa (in the manga) more fit, in her responsible role as a princess, to convey The Message than the split version here. Still, the very idea about man & technology vs. nature and the question of ""is anything ever over"" (ewige wiederkehr, the cycle of life) is at its most nuanced here. In any case, image-wise, I doubt you'll ever see anything as beautiful as this."
"This has to be one of Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece's, one of the films that made Studio Ghibli legendary.Prince Ashitaka falls under a curse that is slowly killing him when he battles a demonic boar, Ashitaka is forced out of his village and forced to seek a cure, during his travels he stays in a mining town called Iron Town, during his stay it unravels that Iron Town is trying destroy the Forest God in order to kill the forest to make more room for Iron Town and its mining operations. Princess San Mononoke is a princess who has been raised by wolves in the forest, and she decides to go to war with the humans to save the forest. Ashitaka makes it his mission to try to make the forest and humans leave in peace, and during his mission he falls in love with San, the Princess.The films voice acting in the English edition is perfect, with the characters speaking with realism and emotion, the only thing better than the voice acting is the scripting, animation, and direction, this film is one you have to see!10/10.Review courtesy of the Anime Community, Anionline.net"
"Given all the hype surrounding Princess M., I expected to like this film a good deal more than I did.I tried to like it. Truly. Unfortunately, the producers make it extremely difficult to do so, since their primary conceit seems to have been: ""let's confuse our audience as much as we can."" The primary way they accomplish this is by having every character vacillate back and forth from protagonist to antagonist every other scene. The wolves are good guys. No, wait, they're threatening to kill the hero. Oh wait, they're trying to save the forest. Nope, they're just small-minded bigots. etc. etc.Worse than the mythic figures were the humans: ah, the people of IronTown are attacked by wolves, goodie! Oh wait, they're destroying the environment, I hate those guys! But wait, they're not as bad as these soldiers, so we sympathize again, only now they're shooting at the Princess of the forest, darn they're bad, but wait...And so on and so on. I recognize the desire to present complex characterizations and avoid the black-and-white mentality of so much fantasy work, but this quickly devolved into simple inconsistency. Eventually I just gave up and decided to hate everybody in the film, after which it became kind of bitter fun to watch them spill one another's blood across the screen (which they do in simply astonishing volumes).As for the environmental sub-text of the movie, it was not only severely undercut by all the heavy-handed side-switching mentioned above, but almost entirely buried in the morass of annoying mythological background which plagued the movie. In the last fifteen minutes, it turns out that this mythological stuff has actually been the whole crux of the movie (surprise), providing the excuse for a boatload of visual effects but leaving the central plot, as it has been heretofore presented, in the dust.Final words: confusing, inconsistent, turgid mythology punctuated by inadequately explained violence. Go read Harry Potter instead."
"I haven't seen this movie in a long time, but I still stand by my choice as this being the best film of the 1990s (that I saw anyway). This was simply the most stunning and beautiful animation I have ever seen. Disney wishes they can make a movie that looks this good. From the opening scene in Ashitaka's village to the forest of the gods, and even the factories of Iron Town, Miyazaki never lets up on creating a wonderful piece of cinematic beauty (He drew over half the frames himself). Also his attention to detail with how the rain falls and hits the ground, how characters move and talk, and flies buzzing in the background. Hell, live action movies wish they could do something this good.All that is worth two hours of your time, but now we add a complex story where there are no good guys and bad guys just people. There is a lot of action in this film which is unusual for a Miyazaki film, but the plot calls for it, and it doesn't detract from the character development. Each character is well defined and has real depth. The screenplay is powerful and emotional. Most live action films can't achieve the complexity of Princess Mononoke, and it would have to be even harder for animation to convey real life feelings, but as I watched it, the script and beauty kept drawing me in further and further.The voice acting was OK for the US version, and outstanding for the Japanese version. Billy Bob Thorton was completely wrong for any part of this movie (a southern accent in Japan?). The other American voices were all adequate. Interesting note, the voice for the wolf god that Gillian Anderson does was done by a male for the Japanese version. The music was as breathtaking as the animation, and was a perfect match, especially at the end during the restoration scene. This is one of the best musical scores I ever heard, and I'm surprised it didn't get the recognition it deserved. Anyways, the song (Japanese, not American) was also beautiful. 10/10 for both US and Japanese versions, but watch the Japanese version if you can."
"Princess Mononoke was on may radar for some time before I first saw it. Hearing that it was a 'Miyazaki master piece' but not really knowing what to expect. However as I started to watch the opening of the film I could tell from the amazing musical score and the breathtaking animation that I was watching a truly captivating film. As the story progresses you get a more three dimensional look at the characters in the film looking from all points of view seeing whats everyone wants. In particular you get a good look at the main character Ashitaka(voiced by Billy Crudup) as he tries to stop a conflict between San(voiced by Claire Danes) ,a girl raised by wolves, who is helping lead the wolves and other Forrest creatures up against Lady Eboshi(voiced by Minnie Driver) the Head of a village who are gradually destroying the Forrest for the resources the land has.Compared to other films Princess Mononoke should rank among the best animated films as it have a level of grandness that could only be matched by films like The Lord of the rings. Over the years this film has also been compared with other anime films however this film has a completely different tone to most of them as you don't get a shonin vibe or a high school romance. Overall I think that This one of Miyazaki's best films and probably one of the greatest animated films ever. That's why I'm giving it a 9/10"
"No matter what the New York Post said about it (as is recorded on many of the DVD editions of the film), this is definitely not the pinnacle of animated films, nor even of Miyazaki's own work. I really, really wanted to like this film more than I did. I am a big fan of Miyazaki and this is supposed to be his masterpiece, but I'm just not able to go that far in my own assessment of it. It was complex, and beautifully animated (as you expect from Miyazaki), but it left me a bit hollow. Part of it was the incredible violence in the film (NOT for children under 13, IMO), and part of it was hearing Billy Bob Thornton's drawl as the voice of Jigo, but a big part of my reluctance to rate this film more highly is that it felt a bit like Miyazaki was reaching for something that he had already grasped. I think he addressed almost identical themes in a much better way in Nausicaa. Princess Mononoke seemed uncharacteristically ""preachy"" and heavy-handed, in contrast with Miyazaki's generally subtle style. I know it's super popular and has a stellar reputation, but I just can't recommend it when there are so many other great works available from this true Artist of Anime."
"Fun info: This is Miyazaki's first forgo into computer animation, used in the dark ""snakes"" near the beginning and a few other scenes and is also one of his most violent films. It also has a solid English dub.It concentrates on a different type of character than most of his films, a young man, Ashitaka, rather than a young woman. His quest does not change him like in many other films but rather he changes many others. The film leans just enough on environmental issues to show a cause while allowing the graphics and story you desire from a Miyazaki film. Special note to the soundtrack which is one Ghibli's best. It concentrates on an iron-works and the battle between various factions of humans, the beasts, and others.I don't plan on spoiling much else as the films plot speaks for itself. My only complaint is that certain scenes drag a bit too long and if anything a bit too much blood spills at a certain part of the film. Otherwise, this film is excellent and one of his best.9.5/10"
"This is a sophisticated film with complex cultural, political and personal themes which just happens to be animated. As in real life, each character has parts that you love and parts that you hate. Ashitaka's impassivity in the face of his fate seems beautiful and noble at the beginning of the film but becomes frustrating, even enraging at the end. Eboshi destroys nature to rescue humans on the brink of destruction. Nobody apologizes for their bias, just like in life. Some critics have accused the plot of being driven by the stupidity of the characters, but this critique holds them to the standards of current US society. Nineteenth century Japan was a society strictly regulated by traditions, traditions that were being threatened by Western incursions into Japan. The characters act the only way that they can act - they do their best in an incomprehensible, unsolvable situation. Personally, I sided with Mononoke, but Ashitaka acts with honor in every situation that he faces. I hope that I would have his inner strength in the face of such problems. Things are not neatly wrapped up at the end. This is only one battle in the war between burgeoning Japanese industry and the ancient gods. The war still rages on in Japan as it does in the United States. Oh, the animation is superb. And, for goodness sake, watch it in Japanese with subtitles. If you watch the English version, you won't see the movie the way that it's intended."
"I'm a big fan of Miyazaki since childhood. I'm 34 years old. But I never come around watching Mononoke. The masterpiece that everyone likes! and his praised by critics and reviewers around the World to be ghibli's best film. Why?.. Maybe I was never drawn to the cover art.. I thought It looked like a bad version of Zelda. So all these years have passed And I have watched all his Movies countless times over. So finally My mind was set. I started watching Princess Mononoke. The Masterpiece of all masterpieces praised to the skies! ..Boy Was I in for a big surprise! It totally sucked!! My Eyes wasn't moved to tears, I started yawning to the action scenes several times.. I was wondering..Is this Studio Ghibli? I didn't like the soundtrack, The romance never took off, For one, they didn't know each other nearly long enough to fall in love. the movie just kinda made it up and expected you to believe it. There was zero evidence of actual romance Eboushi just magically changes her mind at the end? The ending was so anti-climactic. So this girl that he is ""in love with"" decides he isn't important enough for her to invite him to live with her in the Forrest. He also doesn't care enough about the girl that ""he loves"" to follow her in the end. He'd rather go help the townspeople he met last week?!? LOL OK. After all they went though they just decide to part ways & visit each other sometimes, WTF is up with the ending??? The ending... what was the Point of cutting the head of the deer god?? so the emperor girl could awake and understand she did wrong?? she had to kill thousands of boars, shopping every tree, kill Everything just to come to that conclusion that it was pointless? The worst part of this Movie is that I absolutely adored Mononoke. But they never took advantage of that, she is Always out of camera somehow you never get to know her, except she hates humans. It feels like they made this Movie for American audience. Is that why it has such high scores? cause of the generic plot, action, blood and all that usual Hollywood crap? sorry buts that the truth. I can't find Another reason why the big fans of Ghibli actually love this one. It's Not that great. It's the worst ghibli Movie i ever seen actually. The heroine is awesome, the few parts she has in the story, but thats about It. Spirited Away IS A MASTERFUL STROKE OF ART, this is not that good everyone made it up to be."
"I suppose I am a glutton for punishment. I've had a love/hate relationship with anime for quite some time now. Despite being disappointed more often than pleasantly surprised. I keep coming  back for more for some reason. I suppose it's because I hope that sometime someone will get it right and finally mix stunning  visuals (of which there are plenty in the anime world) with a coherent plot, and an interesting story (of which there are woefully few).Princess Mononoke fits into this category quite nicely. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking. I would rate it in the same  category along with other fantastic anime like Macross Plus, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, and Wings of Honneamise. The framerate was better than average for most anime. The only place I think they could have improved was on the behemoth night-walker spirit, which seemed a little choppy at times.The soundtrack is one of the best you'll hear. The musical score in particlar excels right through to the end of the movie. The sound effects were outstanding also. If a soundtrack CD is offered for this movie, I'll buy it in a heartbeat.Where the movie really disappoints is with the storyline. This is tragic too, because there are so many good characters on which to develop and plot devices (the tree spririts were fantastic) to use. After the first 30 minutes or so, the plot becomes incoherent, with no clear direction, and the characters sink into the not necessarily good/bad roles that has become the norm for anime.I feel that Princess Mononoke scores highly on technical merit, but really lacks when it comes to an involved, entertaining storyline. I hope that anime studios will learn from this, and in the future hire some talented writers to match their artists."
"This anime had great potential, and I can say that the first half was exciting, with a full story. However...***SPOILERS***It all gets worse as you grow to dislike the protagonist for helping to save the humans when he should have fully sided with the forest. Because of his desperation to help both sides, the humans manage to destroy the spirit of the forest.The ending is terrible, because even though the forest spirit is killed, Ashitaka says 'Never. He's life itself"" which is untrue, as it was a physical form before, so clearly not the same. And worse, he says he's going to help rebuild Iron Town which was the cause of the destruction in the first place. The ending leaves you feeling angry, that the 'Magic' has gone from the world (all the gods are killed), leaving a world not unlike our own.... and an uncertain future for San and Ashitaka, both going to separate places.Great potential, but an ultimately unsatisfying film."
"My daughter makes me watch these. Nine times out of ten I'm glad. This time I was ecstatic! Ashitaka's village is threatened by a demon boar. In killing the boar, Ashitaka's arm takes on the infection that has turned the boar into a demon. He must leave his village, knowing his fate, knowing that when he fully becomes a demon, he could kill them all.In his travels, he encounters a huge range of characters and situations, ending with what I can only call a great mythology. The movie is breathtaking.One thing I truly love about this show (I hope this isn't a spoiler) is that in the end there are no villains. There are antagonists and protagonists, but everyone is genuinely, sincerely doing what she or he thinks is the best thing. This is a great, artistic, true expression of how things usually are. A great lesson."
"I'm a kid of 14 years old and i watched this movie at 2004. i was really touched by the screen play the dialogue and every thing about it. i couldn't have been touched if the music wasn't so brilliant. i was so touched by the music i bought the soundtrack and kept listening till it made me cry (i don't why). The characters are great the prince and the princess. Shows me a lot what i can do when I'm older, movie is very touching and also very 'breathtaking'. If anything i recommend this movie. if you are my age you will love it go on and try this movie out. adults same thing goes to you P>S i think this the best animated movie made nothing can change that"
"This film would be inside the top 10 films of all time were people in the west only more aware of it. In England we grow up on an unappealing diet of Disney tripe, but we don't realise it is so shoddy because it's all we have. This is because we don't have a strong animation industry of our own really, with the possible exception of Aardman Animations, and we are gripped by America's commercial stranglehold. The lower classes in this country love America and anything it produces, because they are ignorant, pure and simple. The sad fact is that the average person in the street has not heard of Studio Ghibli or Miyazaki. Consequently they think that Disney films are the acme of animation, and show their children Disney films and take them on holidays to Disneyland. It was such a revelation for me to see my first Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away) and when I watched more of Miyazaki's masterpieces, most notably Mononoke-Hime, I realised what animation can and should be. There still persists in this country the idea that animation is somehow a lower art form than live-action films, but the more people see this film, the more things will change. Using animation allows a director to fly effortlessly into the realms of fantasy, and Miyazaki is masterful at it. It amazes me that although western animation has been commercially successful for so much longer, the greatest imaginative leap the directors seem to able to make is talking animals. Brilliant. The Studio Ghibli films, however, are not afraid to make films where almost all of the characters are people (Kiki's Delivery Service) because they are not afraid to take on live-action films on their own territory - they don't feel the need to retreat to the safety of talking animals, where live-action will not usually follow. But the thing about Studio Ghibli films is that they have people and fantastical creatures in the same film, and what's more, interacting with one another.But I'm speaking too generally. Mononoke is for me the best of the best - see as many Studio Ghibli films as possible, but I think this one is the most brilliant. Personally I prefer the Japanese versions of Studio Ghibli films with the subtitles which match the Japanese script, because the American cast are pretty poor. It is definitely the most beautiful film I have ever seen, fantastically well drawn, but it doesn't hide behind a pretty facade. The story is cracking, great action scenes mixed with truly poignant ones, and the overall environmentalist theme of the story gets more and more relevant with every 8-mile-to-the-gallon American SUV sold.In a word: stunning. In two words: see it."
"There have been many times where after watching an anime, I have found myself seriously questioning the value of the medium. Whether due to misogynism, gratuitous violence, or tentacles, I walk away wondering what is going on in Japanese culture. Princess Mononoke, like Miyazaki's other works, is not a vehicle for shameless fan-service, nor does it rely on the tired and implausible concept of mecha as its selling point, unlike so much anime I have seen. Instead, it deals with the age-old tension between human attempts to shape the environment for its own ends and the life-and-death power of nature.Despite its clear point, Princess Mononoke does not stray into obvious lines of good and evil or try to drop the message on the viewer like an anvil. Rather, it portrays both sides of the conflict in a balanced manner, showing the good and the bad and depicting the harm brought by hate on both sides. Perhaps the only major flaw I can see is that Miyazaki's romanticized monarchism, which leads him to again bring out the decidedly clichéd heroic warrior-prince/princess."
"'Princess Mononoke' is, quite frankly, one of the greatest animated films of all time. It's a classic, filled with terrific, eye-popping imagery, complex characters, and it is truly powerful in its dramatic impact. I came close to tears by the film's end.The first thing you will notice about 'Mononoke' is the animation. Animation god Hayao Miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors and bizarre fantasy creatures (personal favorite: Ashitaka's deer/horse steed Yakul). It's a far cry from the increasingly cheap animation we have in America. The movie is ambitious in its scale, and there are some truly magnificent set-pieces, like the near-apocalyptic ending.Also of particular note is the story. These characters and this plot are not black-and-white. Lady Eboshi may be cutting down the forests and angering the gods, but she truly believes it will help her people; she shows compassion to outsiders like lepers and prostitutes, and her regret at Ashitaka's cursed arm is sincere (she did, after all, cause the boar god's madness). San, the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title, has shades of gray, too: Yes, we sympathize with her desire to protect the forest, but she is not innocent of bloodshed. Even Jigo, a con man/priest who wants the Forest Spirit's head for the Emperor (which is obviously a bad idea), has his reasons for committing what may be considered ""evil"".The English voice cast has divided people, but I liked it. Billy Crudup brings gravity and stoicism to Ashitaka, and Claire Danes is appropriately fierce as San. The standouts, however, lie in the supporting cast. Minnie Driver is perfect as Eboshi, bringing wit and elegance to the role; Gillian Anderson breaks from her Scully persona to deliver a powerful performance as ancient wolf god Moro; Keith David, one of America's most underrated actors, rules as the boar god Okkoto, and Billy Bob Thornton is very funny as Jigo. Thornton's Southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans, but I think it adds to the character's charm.'Princess Mononoke' is a masterpiece. To find a flaw in this movie is impossible."
"This is a great anime and the first movie i ever saw from Hayao Miyazaki, i loved this movie and did not know he made it until later.After this movie i watched a lot of his movies like spirited away and castle in the sky, his films are some of the best anime movies out there and this one is one of his best.It is very original, but i love thus movie for it's great fight scenes and wonderful creatures and characters.The story is wonderful and the animation is just about perfect, with great voice overs that i just loved.This is a rare anime that i think any anime fan shouldn't miss out on, with many great things this anime is a classic."
"I have always loved animated film and cartons, but this film truly blew me away. To me this film is the animated film version equivalent of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'. The film creates a world in such detail than the viewer feels as if he/she has been there. The film is beautifully drawn from characters to backgrounds. The characters are not as simplistic as one-dimensional cartoon characters, i.e. the hero is all-good and the villain is pure evil. The two main combatants, Princess Mononoke and Lady Eboshi are shades of gray, thought personally I love the character of Lady Eboshi. The ending also is not cartoonish in that everything is not tried up into a neat little package at the end. See this picture with an open mind and hopefully you will find it as enjoyable as I did."
"This was just... Wow. I'm still mesmerized by the incredibly dense cinematic experience this anime provided from start to finish & I'm still collecting my thoughts on it. Because Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke isn't just one of the strongest feature films put out by the artistic filmmaker or Studio Ghibli as a whole but is a landmark in the world of animation whose quality story, thematic elements & breathtaking on-screen execution makes regular animated flicks look like the works of amateurs.A period drama infused with elements of fantasy & set in early centuries of Japan, Princess Mononoke tells the tale of Ashitaka; a young prince who after saving his village from a rampaging boar-god/demon is stricken by a deadly curse & journeys to the forest of the West looking for an answer, only to find himself involved in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of the forest & the humans who are consuming its resources.The title refers to a young girl who was raised by the wolf-goddess & has a strong hatred for mankind. Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is arguably the creative height of his illustrious film career & presents him in complete control of his craftsmanship. The 2D animation is absolutely dazzling, the supernatural creatures as well as forests are vividly imagined, the voice actors have done a fab job & music elegantly moves its story forward.The main theme this film deals with is the effects of industrialization on nature, deforestation & how it affects the species who've inhabited these places long before man's greed laid its eyes on their lands. On an overall scale, Princess Mononoke is an expertly crafted, deftly envisioned, gorgeously photographed, swiftly paced & masterfully composed work of art & entertainment which transcends the confines of animation with its complex story, strong characterization, adult themes & makes its statement heard rousingly clear.A standard of 2D animation, a treasure of world cinema, and arguably the pinnacle of Studio Ghibli's creativity, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) is strongly, extremely & one hundred percent recommended to each & every film lover around the world."
"I was sick at home when an anime film began on TV. I tried to change the channel but the remote controller was too far away from me so I decided to keep watching the film. It was Mononoke Hime.I leave in the bask country in Spain, where we have a terrorist problem (it looks like it is solved now), and I am tired of films in which when someone believes something, he/she must fight till death for that belief. This film says the opposite. When one believes something, one must GIVE in order to get the best solution to a conflict. This way of approaching a problem, cannot be better displayed than Ashitaka in the film. Wonderful. I've seen the film in Spanish so perhaps then sentence is different, but the one saying ""I've come to understand without being influenced by hate"" could be very profitable for human kind. After the film I watched all Miyazakies, and I must say that the only one that is almost as good as this one is Naussica. Regards"
"""Princess Mononoke"" tells the story of a young man's journey to seek a cure for a curse that will eventually transform him into a demon. When he finds what he's been looking for he also finds himself in the middle of a struggle between the forces of nature and industrialization.The story is highly interesting and artfully told in a mature manner. The mythology makes for a highly imaginative story that is nevertheless eminently accessible. I have no idea what kids would make of it but, as an adult, I found it much more satisfying than the usual animated fare from America.I originally watched the movie with the English dubbing done by Disney/Miramax. At the time, my only complaint was that Billy Bob Thornton was badly miscast. Now, having watched the film with the original Japanese dialogue, I can't see myself wanting to go back to the English version. I watched a few clips afterward and the English dialogue just seemed forced and, at the same time, too Americanized.Visually, the film is splendid. The scenery is often quite beautiful and the action is generally well animated. Musically, the film is decent but not especially remarkable.In the end, when you consider the whole package (animation, voice acting, storyline, etc...) I think that ""Princess Mononoke"" makes a strong case for being Miyazaki's best film, though I admit that I haven't seen all of them (yet). This is definitely a must-see and not just for fans of animation."
"Princess Mononoke is a grand, beautifully animated, heartfelt epic. It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.What I like the most about Princess Mononoke is beyond all of these wonderfully delivered elements of a great movie. It's a movie about compassion and understanding towards animals. Yes, these animals are represented by gargantuan, violent beasts, but the movie is about human headstrong influence vs. animal outlook, sense, and behaviorism. It's about how astonishingly much more acute and attuned an animal's understanding is of the world's natural order than that of a human's.I think Princess Mononoke, while being a beautifully made action-adventure, it's an important film, especially for Miyazaki's younger fans. It's important that they take the message of the film seriously."
"My favorite Miyazaki movie! Maybe not as good as Spirited Away, not as innocent as the Totoro movie and not as European as Howl's Moving Castle. Maybe that's why I like it! It's filled with excellent characters, beautiful music, outstanding animation, and so on. Sometimes less is enough. The other positives are maybe that it's cannot be fully understanded - that's what I love in Miyazaki. He never explains everything, never tells us what to think, but after one of his films, we always feel that we've learnt something very important. And the biggest positive thing in him: he still believes in hand-drawn animation, and all we should do is thank him every time he makes a movie."
"When I rented this movie I was not really into anime but this is my grand exception. I watched it (about) 6 times in a row and it never got boring or old. In my opinion, the worst part of the movie was when I had to return it. The message is there but mostly goes un-noticed due to the constant ""WOW"" factor. This movie is a MUST SEE for everyone. This movie has a great story line that will keep your attention. Some movies have 5-10 minute parts that drag on and bore you as you wait for something to happen. Even in the timid parts of this movie you do not loose your focus on the story. The movie is not overly complex-it's easy to follow and you don't get lost. I recently saw ""Crash"" and although it is a great movie, I mixed up a few characters and didn't always understand what was happening. Crash is the type of movie you need to see more than once to understand, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) is the type of movie you WANT to see more than once."
"I was a little startled by Princess Mononoke. Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle and heard their director Miyazaki referred to as Japan's answer to Walt Disney, I wasn't expecting the considerable violence of this movie. It was appropriate for the movie certainly, but it sure startled me.But if you're not looking for a Disney flick, this is one impressive and wildly imaginative movie. Many scenes are absolutely amazing, and the last half hour is truly stunning, even though I watched it all on TV.The attitude of the movie is very interesting. This is basically technology vs. nature, but even though the film's sympathies lie more with living with nature, the technology side is not portrayed as evil but instead for the most part as good people with a different world view. The absence of black and white thinking in films is rare and always appreciated."
"Having come to this film, knowing nothing about it, I was amazed and delighted to the feel/detail of the film. I just didn't want it to end, it was that good. Also the little white tree dudes were well cool :-) I can not remember this film enough. The time they took to draw, write, edit this is time well spent (it must of taken ages), see IT!"
"Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun."
"I don't understand what all the commotion is about with this film.. Yes, it is beautiful to look at and has great characters and artistry, but it's so hard to follow!  It suffers the same deadfall that many, perhaps MOST anime films do.. The plot is just too confusing.  It starts out ok, even the middle of the film is engaging, but by the end of it there is utter confusion:  Too many characters fighting for too many different reasons.  I am even a science major, an adult, and an animation connoisseur, and this film stumps me.  There are all of these different parties going after the forest spirit, but also fighting eachother.  The forest spirit is ambiguous itself, friendly one moment, and then dangerous when its head is cut off. Warriors want to keep the head as a trophy, so they're stirring up trouble for everyone. There are the metal workers who are doing their own thing but inadvertently creating demons when animals get shot.  Sometimes.  Depending on the species of animal which is infected with the bullet. I think.  Then you have the boar people who are fighting everybody and trying to protect the forest.. And the princess and the wolves, who are really aloof and not on anybody's side.  And then there's Ashitaka, who is mixed up with all of them and has the demon infection himself and wants to find a cure. And we have to hurry up and reunite the forest spirit with its severed head, or we're all doomed.Get all that?  Lovely artwork from the characters to the landscape to the action... Breathtaking scenery and mysticism, but a little too muddled to come off triumphant.  This film would be excellent if it were more explanatory, or just had its plot streamlined a bit.  Anime fans may get it, but I think the average American viewer will be up the creek without a paddle.  Or maybe on the shore WITH a paddle.  Anyway, I'm getting dizzy just trying to sort it out.  A for effort, though.."
"Medieval Japan. Ashitaka has been infected with a strange disease when he killed a mysterious demon boar covered with leaches that attacked his village. On his journey to find a cure he meets lady Eboshi, a female leader of a town exploiting the forest and fighting with creatures protecting the nature. The leader of those creatures is San, princess Mononoke...When I first went to see ""Princess Mononoke"" I expected a gentle, romantic, dreamy fairy tale. Was I surprised when I saw the raw and brutal story! This is in my opinion Miyazaki's most violent film, but non the less, it really is an impressive anime. I wouldn't necessary put it on the 102. place on the IMDb's top 250 films, but I admit it has something in it that fascinates me.------- The most clever aspects of the story are the ones about how lady Eboshi is tricking her people into helping her exploit the Forest, while at the same time dismissing the wolf's revenge attacks as something illogical. Also, just watch the sequence where San is being captured inside a sea of red leaches on a demon boar: the part where Ashitaka jumps into that bunch of leaches trying to save San from them, but is being catapulted into the water, is pure dark poetry and romance in one. Also, there's the spectacular image of the gigantic deer god's body walking through the hills.Still, Miyazaki made a lot of mistakes. The middle of the film is repetitive and too long making only the end exciting, the characters are somewhat wooden and the whole mood of the anxious world is way over the top. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 16. Also, I miss a lot of humor Miyzaki had in his previous films. I got the idea he made ""Mononoke"" just because he was in his depressive ""I hate the world"" phase. All in all, the epic ""Princess Mononoke"" deserved it's success( it's average critic's grade on rotten-tomatoes.com is 7.7/10 ), but in the long term there was still something missing in it's story. What? Just watch ""Being there"" or ""The Graduate"" and you'll see what.Grade: 6/10"
We felt privileged to be able to see this very artistic expression in our remote area.  The animation is beautifully creative but I felt the story line was disjointed; it felt written on the spot.  Maybe some of that roughness is because of translation or cultural differences.  It definitely worked hard at resolving a LOT of conflict.
"""Go and see this movie. You won't be disappointed""I was disappointed.  While certainly a well-animated and relatively unique picture, Mononoke Hime is far from a great picture.It suffers from too major problems: Corny dialogue and pointless elements. While the first might be do to poor translation, the second surely is not. Ideas are introduced but not developed several times.  Other apparent plot elements disappear without explanation, never to return again. 
Yes, there are much better animated pictures out there.  Antz, for example, has many significant advantages over Mononoke Hime."
"I rated this movie a 5 out of 10 purely because it is the only anime movie I've ever been able to stand watching all the way through.  It is so well animated that about half-way through, you even forget that it is anime. However, the story is boring and hard to follow.  I never figured out where this movie was headed, and in the end, I was disappointed and confused.This movie is too violent for kids, and too tedious for adults.  But if you want to prove that it is possible for anime to be done well, you might want to see this movie.  Otherwise, I'd advise not renting it."
"When I saw this for the first time, I actually said aloud, ""This is one of the best things I've ever seen."", no word of a lie. Out of all the movies to cover social issues, this is the best I've seen by far. This is in a league of it's own, and it's gorgeous.What immediately sets ""Princess Mononoke"" apart from films that cover the same material is that it doesn't hold your hand. This is a graphic movie, this is not an animated movie filled with lollipops and cotton candy and singing characters, this is a mature animated film. It respects it's audience enough to know that they need to be shown things they're not comfortable with seeing in animated films, like characters getting their heads and arms cut off. It does way more than taking the obvious route of ""nature good, people bad"", it shows both sides of a conflict, and both sides have genuine complaints and reasons to fight. How many animated films can you think of that can cover a topic like this and not be completely one-sided? My guess is little to none.While Okkoto and Moro are more set in their ways, and resent humans. While Lady Eboshi and Joki care more about money than nature. Ashitaka is truly neutral. He doesn't do things to help one side or the other, he does it because he feels it is right. There's a love story between him and San, but the movie doesn't focus purely on that, it has a bigger message to send. The message is about seeing both sides of a story, and making up your own mind on what to do. Is Lady Eboshi evil? No, she wants the iron, but she employees prostitutes and lepers, society's outcasts, and trusts them with her life. Joki is more money oriented, more willing to do what he has to in order to get what he wants. Even with him acting that way, he comes off as more ignorant than evil. Even Moro and Okkoto are not evil, they're just fighting to protect their way of life, protecting what's theirs. While both sides are corrupted with a darkness that makes them become more evil, you still feel that there is hope for harmony. When the Forest Spirit is killed, and what's left of his body becomes this demon, it kills the forest. But when his head is returned, he is able to rest in peace. The forest will return, but a new age has come, the Gods are no more. It is up to the humans to rebuild, and hopefully make a better life for both sides. I feel like that's where society is on many issues. There are many to one side, many to another, but some in the middle, and sometimes we need to hear both sides of the story. Even in the end, when San says she can't forgive the humans for what they've done, you understand why. You understand that while she may feel that way, there is still hope for a better future.A true masterpiece of not only animation, but also storytelling. There is literally not enough good I can say about this movie, other than to see it for yourself and witness greatness. A perfect way to show both sides of an issue, and well deserving of being in my Top 10."
"Warning to readers, this is not a feel-good movie, its hard-hitting. There is a general tendency among adult audience to not take animation seriously, but I would be shocked if this movie did not leave a huge impact on anyone. This is one of my first reviews on IMDb, this movie has to be watched and internalized by everyone who is concerned about her future. If anything can move humanity to not inflict further harm and damage against mother Nature, it is this movie. If mother Nature had a form,it would closely resemble what Miyazaki has created in this movie. Even the thought of this movie chokes me, the stark unending sadness truly captures what Nature's wildlife is going through because of human activities. If humans ruin the planet in the near future to the extent that it becomes unlivable for all, this movie has the exact elements which can guide us all."
"I have to admit - the idea of this movie was a little too bizarre for me. Characters like a giant boar and a wolf god was kind of what set me off. I did enjoy the animation, however, and the meaning of the movie was great. The idea of nature versus the human world does tie the whole movie together and makes it rather enjoyable. There's a good message to be taken away from the entire movie. I do think that if anyone is a fan of anime or overall a strong animal presence in a film they will enjoy this movie. The female characters have extreme strength as well which is a nice change of pace from several other films. If you enjoy a strong female presence as well this is the film for you."
"I began watching this film, not expecting it to be as great as everyone says, I was wrong. This film totally lived up to what people said it was. The emotions I got while watching this film made it definitely worth watching. I would recommend watching the Japanese version with English subtitles though, I tried watching the English version and it didn't really have good voice acting for certain characters, because of this I didn't get the same feelings I always got when watching the Japanese version. The soundtrack is the most perfect soundtrack I have ever heard, there was not one song I didn't like. The film is beautiful, the visuals have aged well too. Everything felt on point, as I said the film gave very good emotions as I said, but it was after the film that it completely hit me with emotions, and it changed my worldview, in a good way. Never has a film hit me with emotions as much as this one. The film sends off a very good message about hate and what it does to people. I swear if you watch this film you are going to have an extremely hard time finding a better one, it's just that good, the film is unique. I rate this film so high that it goes beyond the boundaries of this scale of 1/10 and reaches another scale of 1/10 in which it gets the rating 11/10. My most favorite film ever. Just watch it if you haven't already, you won't regret it."

In this movie, in Tataraba, women are keys as labor force. Ebishi is a woman. Hyao Miyazaki represents vitality of women."
"""Princess Mononoke"" is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.The original soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices. There is no other animation like it. This is truly an adult work. Children might like some of the visuals , but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about. Even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again."
"This animation movie is a masterpiece. The story is really great and the characters are appealing. The landscape are breathtaking and the anime is well draw. Created by studio Ghibli the best animation studio by far. The movie is about old animal god and demon, traditions , respect, adventure and a bit of romance. The main character is a silent hero, he has good values. Hes the last of the prince of his people. You should really watch that movie I give it a 10/10 it is my favorite. The story really get under my skin. It is hard to find a movie of this quality from now on. Spirit of the forest, Wolf God and, wolf girl princess."
"In Muromachi period Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills the demon before it reaches the village, but its corruption curses his arm in the battle. The curse gives him superhuman fighting abilities, but will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was once a boar god, Nago, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands Nago came from.Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jiko-bō, a wandering monk, who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a Kirin-like creature by day and a giant ""nightwalker"" by night. Nearby, men herd oxen to Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi, when they are attacked by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Later, Ashitaka discovers two injured Irontown men, and sees San and her wolf pack; he greets them, but they leave. He carries the injured men through the forest, where he encounters many kodama, and glimpses the Forest Spirit.In Irontown, Ashitaka learns Eboshi has built the town by clear-cutting forests to claim ironsand and produce iron, leading to conflict with the forest gods. The town is a refuge for social outcasts, including former brothel workers and lepers, whom Eboshi employs to manufacture firearms to defend against the gods; Nago was turned into a demon by one of Eboshi's guns. Eboshi also explains that San, whom she calls Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves as one of their own and resents humankind.San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, knocking them both unconscious. As he leaves the town, he is fatally shot by a villager, but as he is sustained by the power of the curse, continues to carry San far beyond the town before losing consciousness. San awakens and is about to kill the dying Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit saves his life."
"To mister taz1004,After reading your review called Highly-Overrated about the movie called Princess Monoke, I can't stop but say that how wrong you are about this movie. ""Princess Monoke"" has been one of the best animated movie created by Hayao Miyazaki with a strong message about the relationship between human and our earth. At first I too thought this movie would be like the other Miyazaki movies(Totoro and Ponyo) but these movies were base more on child-viewers unlike Princess Monoke which was base more on adult- viewers as this movie was intended to inform the grown-ups about the environmental issue of our earth through the director's creative way of showing it through the movie's incredible story. And if you check the rating's for this movie itself on IMDb, it has been rated PG-13; contains strong images of violence. So, obviously it seems like it was your own fault for showing this movie to your children without checking the content ratings for this movie and than you blame the movie by giving a bad review of being full with violence.If you really love Miyazaki as you said in the beginning, you must know that his animated movies are not like the Disney or Pixar animations. His movies are more mature and have more depth than a Pixar or Disney movies. I think you maybe confused between the Japanese way of animating and the more popular animations like Disney or Pixar, as they are solely different methods and different objectives. So I would recommend that next time before you show your kids any movies be sure to check the ratings and have more awareness about Hayao Miyazaki's work before stating bold statement against his movie."
"If I had to summarize this movie in a few words, I would say – Breathtaking, Magnificent, and Brilliant. It is one of my top ten favorite films. One of the many things that make this film great is the story. The film is set up in the Iron Age in ancient Japan when the humans used to live in harmony with nature. But the discovery of Iron and selfish nature of humans led to the mass production of weapons which altered this balance. Princess Mononoke is a movie about Nature versus Humans. It also takes elements from Japanese myths and folklore and shows us the great ancient Japanese culture.The opening scene of Princess Mononoke is jaw-dropping. In the beginning, we see a strange creature and thousands of snakes (or whatever it was) coming out of his whole body. This strange creature goes berserk and tries to wreak havoc upon a nearby village. A young lad named Ashitaka tries to stop him from going to the village and send him back to the forest but things go wrong and Ashitaka kills the Creature. The strange snakes grab Ashitaka's hand and leave a mark before vanishing into thin air. It turns out that the creature was a giant Boar who turned into a Demon God. He was cursed and the curse of the Demon God was now transferred to Ashitaka.They find a metal piece in the remains of the Boar and come to know that someone shot the boar with a gun and that is why his agony and hate for humans turned him into a Demon God. Ashitaka, knowing that he has only a few days to live, goes out on a journey to find the person who shot the Boar and was responsible for this heinous act. This journey leads him to the west. There he meets Lady Eboshi who rules a piece of land called Ironworks and was responsible for the Boar's death and Ashitaka's curse. She has thousands of workers working under her. She knows how to make gunpowder and weapons which were responsible for the Boar's death. She does not hesitate to kill anyone who tries to stop her. She wants to rule the forest but is she a bad person? You will have to decide for yourselves because Miyazaki does not let you judge the characters easily.Ashitaka also meets Princess Mononoke or Mononokehime – a wolf-girl, born human and raised by wolves. She despises humans because she thinks that humans are filthy, selfish and pathetic creatures. She has vowed to kill the humans and take back the land of Ironworks that once belonged to the forest. She is always looking for the ways to kill Lady Eboshi and her people. Now what happens, you will have to watch that for yourselves. I am not going to spoil the film for you.This is just the basic plot of the film and let me tell you that the storyline is much more complex than this. There are so many characters and subplots and all the characters are well developed. Ashitaka's character has the proper depth, warmth, kindness, wisdom and courage whereas San's character is developed as an angry soul who just wants revenge. Lady Eboshi's character is given different personalities so you won't be able to judge her. You will also get to see the Deer God AKA the Forest God, The Spirits of the Forest, Humans, Wolves, Villagers, Boars, Apes and other creatures. Princess Mononoke is a story about how messing up with nature can lead to devastating results and it delivers the message successfully. The story is epic and the scale is huge, but the storytelling is what makes it brilliant. Miyazaki takes you to this great journey where you can feel everything. Any other director would not be able to achieve such depth and beauty. Miyazaki had a great understanding of animated films and that is why the people at Pixar and Disney worship him and see him as their idol.The animation work in Princess Mononoke is hand drawn and the result is breathtaking. The scenes that take place in the forest are outstanding. Each and every frame is having great details and beautiful colors. They pop out of the screen and make you want to live in the world you are seeing. At the top of that, the 3D rendering adds more depth and beauty to the handmade drawings. You don't just see the world of Princess Mononoke, you experience it and live in it during the whole runtime.The score of Princess Mononoke is one of the best scores I have ever heard in a film (The Lord of The Rings and Princess Mononoke are my favorite). I have seen this film more than 5 times and I cry every time I listen to the Theme. Joe Hisaishi, you are a genius. Overall, Princess Mononoke is a once in a lifetime experience. I loved it the first time I watched it. Then I listened to the OST and watched it again and loved it even more. I love it more and more every time I watch it. So it is a kind of movie that grows on you after multiple viewings. I was not a lucky guy because I couldn't watch it on big screen but I seriously want to watch this in theaters even if it costs a hefty amount. You cannot go wrong with Miyazaki, can you? May his soul Rest in Peace."
