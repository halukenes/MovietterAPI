"From an anime nonetheless.Much has been said about this great animation and most of it is true.
It is beautiful, tender, modern (watch the film and you will understand) and makes human love interesting again.With that said, it is too bad that Hollywood has picked this up. Not that I will be watching that remake, but I cringe already at the thought of Hollywood hack and remake specialist giving this an American swirl. All the cliches of bad remaking and safe corporate changes will be applied. Aaaarrrggghh"
"In a world dominated by stupid sequels, prequels and remakes it is film/anime like this that restores hope in today's entertainment.Not only it is emotional and feels real, it delivers a relevant message. I love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that it aims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attention to.The only reason I don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is that I still feel a couple of Miyazaki movies (like Kiki, Chihiro and the racoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little more imagination.Whatever the case I live in fear of the Hollywood announced remake by Hollywood hack JJ Abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. As with others I will ignore and boycott that coming insult and always cherish kimi no na wa."
"Beauty, Mystery and Creativity, don't they?I am scared for the day Jar Jar Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy get hold of this and make the hero a Disney princess and bore all our pants off.before Disney gives Kimi No Na Wa the Ghost In The Shell treatment get hold of this original and beautiful film. I guarantee you the girl is not Melissa McCarthy and doesn't have body issues."
"This anime is just superb. It is one of those moments when a rare absorbing story, beautiful locale and art come together. It deserves all the praise it is receiving.With success comes cash hounds and mercenaries of course. Worst of them all is JJ Abrams from Hollywood. He has been given the task of remaking Kimi No Na Wa. OH NO! The feeling will disappear, the underlying sense of humanity will disappear, the story will be set in (I am guessing) Dallas Texas or some similar dump, the girl will be wearing long prairie skirt like a good Jewish girl and we will all ask why didn't Hollywood learn a lesson from the American remake of Ghost In The Shell which was a mess?Sigh. It makes me depressed that money is so important in this world."
"Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!"
"An orgasm for the mind and of course the eyes.This animation is an instant classic. I recommend watching it whether an adolescent or an adult...By the way, Hollywood has commissioned Mr. Rip Off Jar Jar Abrams to remake it. OH HELL NO!!! BOYCOTT THAT!!!!!!!!!!"
"But I really came here to ask fans of the story, the animation and the feeling to boycott Jar Jar Abrams' version. As we all know the Hollywood hack remaker was given a contract to make an 'American version' of Your Name.
Please boycott it. Do not watch it. Certainly do not pay to go to the theater to watch it. Send a message.Kimi No Na Wa was emotional and entertaining and the legacy should be preserved."
"A good anime that has a message, interesting characters, authenticity despite retelling a niche sub-genre story. The work that has gone into and the originality are appreciated. What was less impressive was the stoic reactions and matter-of-fact behaviours. With that said this is quite an accomplishment and I know that with the announced Hollywood remake we the fans need to boycott the coming movie. Hollywood has to learn that their predatory attack on anything popular for their infamous remake series will not be tolerated. Look how they mocked Ghost In The Shell (rolling my eyes as I write)."
"Buy two copies of this DVD but never ever even bother with the coming American remake.Do you think the Hollywood system will allow a woman to be pretty and love her body and keep any fan service?
Not a chance.Who needs remakes of perfection anyway?"
"May I ask you a favor?Please boycott the inevitable American remake. I know that Kimi No Na Wa made a lot of money so therefore I know automatically that the remake will come and it will be a Hollywood con job (think Ghost In The Shell SHUDDER).Kimi No Na Wa to me is an extremely well written and well thought story with amazing visuals. The bond between the characters, even in animation was something else. It was beautiful.The world does not need an American remake."
"The theme of love and no boundariesThe fan service and naturalness of the feelings: the upskirt shot, the pretty legs, the skirt scene and generally the femininityof the female charactersThe candid relationship between co-workersThe science fiction element
Thanks"
"Film is pretty. Girl is pretty. Her village is pretty, the co-worker waitress' legs are pretty. Disney sucks in comparison."
1- This is a fun animation and has many pretty elements. I think more people should watch it.2- Hollywood hacks are remaking it US style to make money. No one should watch that copy.
"The only reason I do not give it a higher rating is because the girl had short hair.
Your Name is a fun and really entertaining animation. Whats with Hollywood remaking it?? Go away Hollywood. Pretty girl, pretty legs, pretty co-worker and wow that animation."
"Kimi no Nawa is up there with the quality of work Studio Ghibli makes. It's a journey in a world breathing with atmosphere, mystery, and visual wonder. A journey about growth and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. A journey about human emotion that transcends space and time, as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate. A journey that might just be one of the most captivating anime movie experiences I've had in years. Director Makoto Shinkai's artistry is something people tend to love or hate, but this film is solid proof to all of his disdainful critics that his movies were never ""just eye candy"". They explore the nature of life and relationships in quiet ways rarely seen or discussed, which is why most of them are not fast-paced or action packed...and why they are so beautiful. But even if you're not a fan of this kind of style with its major use of metaphorical imagery and mixture of subtle and explosive emotions, definitely give Kimi no Nawa a chance. This is by far his most ambitious, original movie in many ways. For instance, there's an actual mystical element to the story apart from his previous films that are set purely on realism. The pacing is a lot faster and intense. There's a surprising amount of humor in the script, making the chemistry between the characters more light-hearted and comically entertaining than expected. All of this is done through a narrative vision so emotional, so brilliantly realized, that I'm pretty sure everyone at the Anime Expo world premiere screening was tearing up, including me. Without spoiling, what mainly drives this film's story is the dynamics of our main characters' relationship. The way these two interact is just so unique and lovable. The premise itself allows them to bond on a more personal level, far more intriguing than the usual teenage love story where boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy gets girl. Eventually, you become so invested in their strange relationship, that when all the action goes down, it's no longer just suspenseful - it's almost heartbreaking. Editing and sound design play a HUGE role in this immersion. There's rarely a single dull moment because of how gripping and emotionally driven the timing of every cut is. The sound design combined with a beautiful music score is outstanding - subtle and moving when creating atmosphere, powerful at times of dramatic conflict. In fact, the same can be said for pretty much all of the visual aesthetics - which if I haven't already mentioned, are amazing. This is a prime example of astonishingly jaw-dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling.Kimi no Nawa is not just any anime movie. It has the potential to be viewed and studied as art cinema. It's so beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed, I feel like I didn't even cover 80% of its greatness in this review. To do that, I would have to make a spoiler analysis review, and to do that, I would probably have to see the movie again, maybe a couple more times before I can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece. I know I sound like I'm fanboying, but as a film student and anime fan for many years, I'm being fully honest here - if Director Makoto Shinkai keeps this kind of quality up, he is going to be an even bigger name in the anime industry for years to come. Remember Your Name long enough until it's available in your country, if you're not seeing it in Japan theaters. Because trust me, you're not going to forget it. 10/10"
"I went in to see Kimi no Na ha without knowing anything about the movie. I had simply been intrigued by the movie poster with the comet as a background to two high school students living in wildly different environments - and the excellent reviews on its Friday release convinced me to see it just the day after.Not knowing anything about the movie made me relish every single moment of it. The two main characters would, it seems, never have the occasion to meet each other, but through a mysterious circumstance are led to share some of their waking hours with each other. At first, the movie struck a compelling, funny and nostalgic view at high school life in Japan, love, friendship, puberty, teenage angst and some elements of mysticism. It felt like a very fresh and charming sentimental love comedy with a dash of depth and teenage angst. And it already utterly captured me at that point.Yet midway, the movie veers resolutely into dramatic, and more mystical territory, while managing to keep the lighthearted tone it had reached during the first half at just the right moments. Together with one of the main characters, I was shocked and powerless upon learning of one aspect that had eluded both protagonists, as well as the audience. At the same time, a trope often used in science-fiction got thrown into the mix and the stakes suddenly get much higher, making me look back to the first half of the movie and thinking ""wwwooooowww I get it now"", while following the paths of the protagonists, which, just like the Kumi Himo (thread making?) that Miyamizu Shrine makes, represent time itself. Meeting, diverging, tangling, getting cut, doubling back. The second half of the film is a perfect adventure, full of suspense, humor, hope, and yes, tears. And at some points, it gets close to tragedy (one scene in a train left a huge lump in my throat). In some respect it reminded me of Spirited Away (my long time favorite animation movie), in which both main characters grow thanks to the other, and whose paths had crossed and would cross again, beyond memory or reality.Saying more would spoil the movie, so I have been very, very vague. Suffice it to say the movie made me laugh, cry, get the goosebumps, and got me to the edge of my seat at some points. It really had great storytelling, pacing, characters, and emotions throughout. I loved it.The visuals were also gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Tokyo is more real than the real Tokyo, and the director, animators, background artists, and computer artists seem to have devilish fun playing with lighting and getting some of the most beautiful scenes and moments I can recall in an animation movie.I should mention the music as well, which was very, very good. I know RADWIMPS (I went to see them live a couple of years back), but was surprised at the tone they achieved, and how well it fit with the movie - the music, along with the visuals, really help in getting a full immersion into the story.However, some of the most hilarious jokes in the movie seem to be untranslatable to English - in particular the ""dialects"" of the main characters, as well as a specific moment that makes use of several of the ways that Japanese people use to refer to themselves, depending on context and sex (watashi, watakushi, boku, ore). So I'm looking forward to seeing how those scenes will be handled in the translation!I have since seen the movie one more time, bought the OST, and bought and read the novelization (which is almost like the movie, but does give more insight into each character's thoughts and thought processes.). Highly recommended!"
"In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions from outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the most basic narrative of all, the love story.And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult to do right.This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSY GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN, another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the other. I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all, because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving, this powerful, in graphic form."

"The main character is pretty and slender. The colleague at work for the boy is also pretty and slender. They are interesting and attractive characters.
Watch this again and again."
"So the movie is named ""Your name?"" and its a perfect title, it doesn't reveal anything about the content and yet it caught my interest. I tend to watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at the same time it is a tougher competition.The story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it will be pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question about how and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible. Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of view of Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how they dress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voice actor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start till end. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me and everything living around me, where I come from and where I am going. Regarding the character development its spot on, no more information was needed then what was provided, we are limited but at the same time free to make our own thought.I wish to say thank you to everyone who have supported and/or worked with this piece of art, they should feel really proud of themselves, it is an honor that you shared it with us (the viewers). Thank you!"
"Loved the illustrations, the beautiful sky, the village, the fan service and the girl's and female co-workers slender and beautiful legs and of course will not even pirate stream the American remake. I am already vomiting thinking of that commercial trash."
"Absolutely fantastic! Recommended for everyone.Just watch it.Amazing characters, scenery, city life and town life, story. Everything is just wow. So fine! The suspension, the empathy, the scenes. The thoughts. It's playful and pleasant, but serious and funny at the same time. It makes you want to feel it and live it, while you just keep cheering for everything.This 1.5 hours was one of the most well spent time in my life. It was so good, that I actually sit down and wondered why we can't we live like that? Why can't we be in that village? In that anime Tokyo?Every minute is a time well-spent. It's a time SO well spent, that I was afraid when it's going to end. I literally just realized that this would be the end of an anime. Than this would be the end of an hour long movie.I was so afraid when it's going to end. It borough such a beautiful and marvelous utopia before my eyes, with all it's mistakes, conflicts. That I actually wanted to live there. I actually realized however, that I'm not good of a person to be worthy of such utopia.However it is very close to reality. Every time something out of order happens, you remember. This is a certain reality. People can die, be ashamed, punished. Everything can end in a tragedy. But when something wrong happens, nobody really cares.. and I was like: ""Why? Why aren't you moving? Are you not afraid for your lives?"" Than I remembered.. this is a certain utopia. Even for the people who live in it. Nothing bad happen to them, nothing really could. They are peaceful, good people, in a modern world. Nothing bad happened in the last 3 generation, why would anything happen now?This movie gave me a new set of feelings, viewpoints, happiness, thoughts and desires, I might have lacked or just not realized before. I'm really glad I watched it. It was a piece from my dreams."
"I have followed Makoto Shinkai's older works and most of them really have a bad ending, though still good, but this movie's sweet. He really know how to play with our emotion, especially for his work's fans who have followed his works, i'm hoping its not a bad ending during the entire movie.But man, this work is a true masterpiece. When i looked at Makoto's older works, I suddenly think, he had the potential to beat Miyazaki's spirited away, and there he goes. I'm not saying this is better than spirited away, they had a different genre and makoto had his own stunning style.How this piece of animation would turn my emotion really hard? Even Spirited Away, When Marnie was There, and 5cm per second can't do that. This is a movie that you must watch before you die, really."
"'Your Name' is not just one of the best animes in recent years (and there have been some very good ones), but one of the best animes ever from personal opinion.Will go even further, saying it's one of the best animated films in recent years, one of the best animated or otherwise films of the year and that it rivals the masterworks of Miyazaki. This is a huge compliment, for any anime, animated film or even any film, and a bold claim that still stands. Much of it is to do with how 'Your Name's' stayed with me and the impact it's had, a film once seen but never forgotten.The animation in 'Your Name' is stunning, so beautifully and intricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in the backgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but also atmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with no problem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own, serving superbly as music on its own.Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much to say and explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. The storytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and never lets go of the immersing and is enormously heartfelt, really investing in the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing is deliberate, but never drags due to the emotional impact and how well realised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the second half.Characters, and the film's themes, are brilliantly written and developed, and the voice acting is emotive and fit the characters with no qualms.In summary, a truly magnificent film all round that will be remembered for years to come. Deserves all the raves it's gotten, and deserving of even more. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word ""city"" described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow, they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied. There are some usage of stock characters and several clichés throughout, something that maybe will drive some of the audiences away or cloud their judgment. But beside all that, the story is still original and well executed.What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well."
"But I recommend you watch this animation if you want to watch just one.It has a good story, romance, science fiction and begins with some fine desirable legs and if you are patient you are rewarded with an upskirt shot.Rich and vivid world making."
"This was absolutely amazing... the trailer made it seem like a stereotypical ""boy meets girl, etc."" story... but from the beginning to the end, the movie rotated from a past and present time-line, only proving in the end that time itself was twisted the entire movie - giving us viewers an extremely well written and original plot. The chemistry between the characters, development, music, pacing, animation, everything was absolutely in chorus in the most beautiful way. I cannot even compare this to Studio Ghibli films, not because it's better or not as good, but because it is just a movie of its own caliber. Studio Ghibli films were a lot more fictional, fantasy, and imaginative - free formed and had its own flow. Kimi no Na Wa was cleverly planned out from the first minute to the last, logical, balanced, yet just as if not more breathtaking."
"It's been a while since I've seen something outside of Studio Ghibli, being the most recent When Marnie Was There. I'm not familiar with Makoto Shinkai's work but this certainly encourages me to watch the rest of his catalog. I knew nothing about the film until only the day before seeing it, instantly attracted to the poster and the mini synopsis of two high school teens from opposite sides of the country, who periodically switch in their dreams. Gladly I didn't read anymore into it and just went to watch it as there's so much more to the intriguing story at face value. It's a little confusing at times bouncing between the two characters, but that doesn't deter the enjoyment and wonderment of the film. We follow quiet country school girl Mitsuha voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi, going about her daily chores and traditions in a village shrouded by folklore and superstition with mayor-elect pushing for advancement. All this while we also follow rough-and-ready city boy, Taki, voiced by Ryûnosuke Kamiki, who is no stranger to voice acting, starring in Spirited Away at the age of eight and later in Howl's Moving Castle. The two become celestially bound to one another without fully understanding how, or even knowing who each other are, which leads them both on an adventure of discovery, comical annoyance and eventual romance. It's perfectly balanced between the two even with a number of interesting side characters, each adding something to the intricacies of the plot and supplying a lot of the light-hearted comedy. The scenery and animation is stunning, vibrant and beautifully breathtaking; with blinding lens flares and gorgeous landscapes that fill the entirely screen. It's superbly paced, perfectly edited so not to make a mess of the constant jumps. The score by the Japanese rock band, Radwimps is simply amazing, perfect for the film with a mixture of teeny pop/rock and pleasant instrumentals, with surprising tracks like ""Kataware Doki"" using soft pianos and strings. It's a score Final Fantasy composer, Nobuo Uematsu would be proud of. There are some films that are not meant to be for live action, showcasing the stunning craftsmanship and elegant talent of the skilled animators and artists, this being one of those films. The actual anime capturing the magical essence of the heartfelt story that I don't believe can be replicated as good live. Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful. Certainly the best anime I've seen this year.

"I started watching this movie with high expectations,but somehow this movie managed to be exceed them.Movie didn't just look amazing,which is expected from Makoto Shinkai,but story is amazing as well,it manages to keep attention of viewer from start to finish,and as movie progress it just gets better and better.I think that everyone that loves movies should watch this.Even if someone doesn't like animated movies they should give this movie a try.Also i love how some little things that at first seem meaningless at the end of movie get amazing meaning. Personally i think this is best work that Makoto Shinkai made by far,its above all of his previous works,and doesn't have flaws that some of his other works had."
"which movie includes time travel, destructive meteor shower,heart-wrenching tragedy,mesmerizing romance,wonderfully extravagant art and many more genres in 1.5 hours,none to my knowledge.'your name' is a beautiful blend of sci-fi, thriller ,romance.I watched the movie just after it's release and believe me i found no reason to blink my eye, it is yet another masterpiece by makoto shinkai.when watching Japanese anime movies, the westerners usually prefer studio ghibli's work , but after this many might reconsider this.if you want to know what I'am speaking about just watch it and you would cherish those 1.5hrs of emotions filed with love,agony,tragedy,joy.And please believe me this is no exaggeration.while watching the movie you will feel your heart racing craving for more drama,romance but still you want to know how it ends and amid-st this confusion you will be using your brains to understand what is going on.And when it ends you will be realizing that it is the one epic movie that will go on in your ""the best movies i've ever watched"" list. And the next moment you will be writing or telling about the movie to your friends.P.S Just consider watching it and you will never regret it."
"The feeling, the humanity, the sense of wonder and the sentimental neature of the story.
The animantion, the colors and the fluidity of the art but the length was slightly overlong. An edit should have been made."
"Your Name is a journey about growth and having the ability to bounce back when thrown against overpowering hardships. It's a journey that focuses on human emotion that are larger than time and space. It's a journey of where we watch our protagonists struggle again and again against destiny. And it's one of the greatest animated journeys you will ever experience.Watch the review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7v32c900F4 and / or read along hereYour Name follows a girl from the country and a boy from the city who have never met that switch bodies when they dream. This movie may seem like your romantic-comedy body-swap situation. But it will surprise you how in depth the gets. The storytelling here is top notch, because you understand everything, but when you think about it, the concept gets quite confusing, but because of the brilliant direction my Shinkai, he somehow makes it understandable. The two protagonists are the driving force of the film instead of Shinkai's normal eye candy visual sell outs. Within the great writing are actually some very funny and memorable conversations. The comedy works well to add another layer to the great chemistry between the protagonists. Props to the actors.It was just so fun watching the dynamic feelings of these two and I loved how the two genders figured each other out while inhabiting the others' body. I was a little confused when a lot of the first act is dedicated to the girl, without really seeing the movie from the boy she's swapping with, his view. But the movie surprised me when something happened to the girl and we see the boy for most of the rest of the movie. So actually the screen time for both protagonists were quite similar. That blew me away.If you delve deep into his work Shinkai tends to break the forth wall often in the way he portrays emotions. He, in a way, makes you reflect upon your own life, and all his movies are really, really relatable. He makes you look back on dark times, times you don't really want to think about again and he says a different messages every movie. A big part of the film was it's editing and sound design. This all helped with the immersion. Every scene is dripping with hidden details covered in immense beauty sugar coated with an outstanding soundtrack played by Radwimps.And although the end is predictable, it did what 5 Centimetres Per Second didn't do. It left me satisfied. What seemed like a stupid idea turned into Your Name. And it's not just another Japanese animation. There are so many scenes where it feels like the Shinkai just pulls the rug from underneath you, like the movie doesn't always follow the normal routine. I felt so many emotions in this movie.It grips you in that way and shows that every second in the movie and in life is important.This movie takes every awesome element that Shinkai has ever used in his films and are all constrained into this movie. This film has jaw dropping photo-realistic visuals with beautiful Japanese voice work, great cinematography, laugh out loud comedy, gripping story, insane twists, looming soundtrack, heart racing action, unforgettable quotes.But the best part about this movie is that it has very few mistakes. Everything is in the film for a reason. Still, I don't feel like I've covered most of the points of why this movie was so good without spoiling anything. But I can say that when I watched it, it was something special. Looking around at other reviews and forums, I have a feeling, that this will be regarded as one of the best animated movies ever made.A+10 / 10Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA"
"I think most of us can safely say that as far as pure direction and art go, Makoto Shinkai's popular new movie called ""Your Name"" has taken the world by storm. As of now, it has won several large prizes and it's praised by casual watchers and critics alike.There is no doubt that this is in fact one of Makoto Shinkai's most beautiful pieces of art as far as pure visual fidelity goes. That, in combination with its engrossing soundtrack just allows the movie to speak to the heart directly. This often means that people will refrain from criticising this movie, and i find myself being a lone bird flying in the opposite direction of all the others when it comes to this movie.The issue i have with this movie doesn't lie in its art, or in its direction. It more lies within the lack of depth in the story itself. Makoto Shinkai is known for using repetitive settings in his movies, as they do tend to sell well.I just wish Makoto Shinkai would have been a bit more creative in his writing, rather than making me think ""oh, it's this again. Not very original."" The story is confusing, but once i figured it out it didn't leave me lost in thought and i was honestly disappointed. That being said, Your Name is still a solid movie with stunning animation and I'd recommend you try watching it yourself. It's not very long and it's definitely worth a watch purely because it looks stunning."
"I don't have much to say because I'm completely stunned after watching this movie. This movie is unbelievable. It's one of the best films I've ever seen. I just finished watching it about an hour ago, and I'm still reeling. Reader: I don't know what you want from your films. But this movie is one of the most charming, transporting, amazing movies I've ever seen. I cannot recommend more."
"I have rated more than 1000 movie on IMDb. So, when I write that this is the best movie I have ever seen and the only movie that I wrote a review about, I mean it. I always had a deep fear that I will never meet my other half, and this movie perfect capture that feeling. There is a pain when you wake from a perfect dream and you realize that you will forget about this perfect world, that was your whole world for that few moments. I am afraid that I will cross the one without even saying hi to her. I will say this is a must watch movie for everyone. Good graphics, excellent story, and you are genuinely happy at the end of the movie."
"I have read quite a few reviews from both side before writing mine; I could understand why some people dislike this movie.For those who love this movie, they are those viewers who flow with the story with an open mind. There are always flaws in every story, if we keep nitpicking the plot hole, they will never come to appreciate what a movie could offer to them.People seems to forget the reason to watch a movie - to escape from our reality. This movie does deliver a moment for the audience to get along this amazing journey of Mitsuha and Taki. My wife and I try to solve the puzzle when the story continue to unfold, there were a few moment that we were able to put pieces together and see if the story goes as we thought. There were also moment we doubted whether the event will be different than it originally was. We hold our breath to see how the story will end, I was crossing my finger that the ending will be at least in some form of closure. I am glad that it was.Referring back to my review's title, by walking through this story, I could feel, once again, the energy by being youth. I am in my mid 40s and this movie touch my soul and brought my heart out as in my 20s.For those who can't stand any flaw in the story line, I believe this movie will not able to touch your heart or I should say, this is not your cup of tea."
"No spoilers.Just made an IMDb account just to give this movie a 10. I've never reviewed any movie online before. But this movie is a perfect 10, and if you haven't watched it then you're missing out on so much.The music, the characters, the voice acting, the plot - literally all 10/10. You'll feel all sorts of emotions watching this movie. Easily one of my top 5"
"Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot's complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie's eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film's two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki's body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It's no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha's body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki's experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha's familial duty to her small town's local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film's ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha's country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the ""opposites attract"" sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven't walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece."
"Your Name is one of my favorite movies of all time and will always have a special place in my heart. Its animation, soundtrack, story, everything about it is just amazing and something barely seen. The Idea that the two main characters switch bodies every once in a while is something almost never seen in anime and it pulls it off perfectly. It has one of the biggest twists and a very satisfying ending that will keep you on your toes for the whole of part 2 just to get to it. You can tell that there was an immense amount of effort and passion put into this film and I beg you to watch this masterpiece."
"As an avid follower of the works of Studio Ghibli, this film had much to live up to, especially considering its deeper themes and the exploration of a different, more subtle sort of romance between two individuals separated by time and space. Unfortunately, this film turned out exactly as I expected and feared, with an interesting storyline and basis, yet the characters, dialogue, and overall crafting of the story itself detracted from the overall quality. I will focus mainly on the negatives in this review, as there are a plethora of other reviews that seem to only focus on the highlights.The main issue that I had with Your Name was the script. Having seen it both in the original Japanese with English subtitles, and also dubbed (on my second viewing) with the English voice actors, I was really hoping for the proper brevity and gravity that Studio Ghibli so constantly delivers. However, I was met with the characters stuck in an endless loop of telling viewers what they were feeling, and especially in the more intimate moments of the film, where this could have been left more to the viewers deduction – if someone is crying for a particular reason, it is often best left for the viewers to decide why; the character does not always need to vocalise their feeling in order to convey them. For this reason, I felt that I had very little attachment to the characters in a setting where attachment to the characters was vital.Furthermore, I believe that very little of the humour in this movie worked for the better. As I stated before, in a movie as heartfelt and intimate as this, the dialogue and the humour should be handled with the utmost care, and most of the time throughout the movie, I felt as if it took you away from the story – by all means, there certainly would be moments of humour when a boy switches bodies with a girl and vice versa, but humour was not the purpose of this movie, and this should have been respected.One last, and slightly more subjective gripe, but I found the music choices to often be contradictory and 'annoying,' to say the least. I understand that the montage sequence, set to an upbeat pop/rock song is a common event in the world of anime, and having seen many anime outside of Studio Ghibli myself, I understand and respect this. However, with a movie such as your name, I found it only broke apart the emotional storyline, and in many ways, lost some of the viewers investment in the story. The piano sequence (the main theme, I believe?) was beautiful; why not exclusively keep the orchestral/piano score throughout the entire movie? Overall, Your Name was a very solid attempt at a very difficult premise, with beautiful visuals, a poorly handled storyline, and not much else. 7/10"
"Your name is a unique screenplay with a unique story twist the film is full of drama / romance even mystery
a great story with a great fiction the graphic that is perfect, Comfortable and attractive with a great soundtrack that get you in the mood
The most interesting thing about the film is the design of characters, their behavior and their causes
And the new fiction
the plot was interesting and it was flow very well"
"Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Just a city boy... No, wait. Hear me out. Granted, it's initially hard to sell Your Name - a meet cute anime twist on Freaky Friday - as a worthwhile recipient of its considerable, well-deserved hype, rather than a big screen, big budget rendition of Fruits Basket. But the hype is real. Inauspicious or not, writer/director Makoto Shinkai's film is somewhat of a genre-bending game changer - a film so special that the struggle to properly do justice to it leaves me resorting to inelegantly cherrypicking from a slew of contemporary allusions (the elegant loneliness of Murakami; the mischievous whimsy of Wong-Kar Wai; an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interwoven with The Breakfast Club with the most imperceptible pinch of your average buddy cop comedy comedy for spice), while it is still far more than the sum of their parts. In short, it's one of the most unexpected, simple but profound, entrancing, and poetically beautiful films to cross screens in years. It's as fun as it is melancholy, as unforgettable as it is sweetly unassuming. Even better - it's that rare anime where comparisons to Studio Ghibli aren't simply lip service, but actually warranted in terms of exquisite, painstaking heart and attention to detail. Yes, really. But such lofty praise is actually far from the spirit of a film that goes about its remarkable business with a cheeky subtlety. Shinkai wisely plays off the initial silliness of his concept, with the early body swap sequences staying rooted in lighter, bawdier humour, playfully portrayed with a springy, sassy wit keeping even the broadest moments no less human and adorable for their broadness. The conceit itself is kept indifferently vague, apart from the haziest of nods to traditional spirituality - it's not the 'how' that matters here anywhere near as much as the 'what.' Similarly, there's a clearly delineated dichotomy between the two protagonists' 'tradition vs. modernity' milieus (with larger, extrapolating themes of supplanting history and cultural longing spanning generations to be teased out by those keen enough), but Shinkai is content to let the contrast sit, rather than milking it for shoehorned theme, or garish social commentary. More than anything, the film captures that ethereal but omnipresent sense of vague dissatisfaction, longing, and persistent but directionless striving that is bound to feel almost achingly familiar to any given audience member, regardless of age, nationality, or standing in life. Shinkai takes a distressingly familiar sense of ennui, and infuses it with a melancholy grace, a feeling accentuated hugely by the film's simply gorgeous, sweeping artwork, infusing panoramas of mountain-dwarfed Japanese countrysides and bustling Tokyo skyscrapers with an unbelievable level of composition and care. When the film glissandos into a third-act twist that is as devastating as it is unpredictable for all but the most eagle-eyed of viewers, it transcends into a piece of larger-than-life folklore, conjuring an almost feverishly heightened viewership that redefines magnetic, before culminating with a quiet grace note that ties up the emotional knot in ways both elegiac and unforgettably uplifting. It may sound like a perennial squall of emotional peaks and valleys, but Shinkai surfs it with nonchalant poise, with his rock-steady pacing lending the film an almost uncanny gestalt. Upon the arrival of the closing credits, don't be surprised to hear a wet gasp, equal parts tearful and jubilant, erupting from your throat, unsolicited. You won't be alone in doing so. If there are any imperceptible faults to be found, it's that Shinkai's perhaps inevitable leaning on anime tropes do, at times, dip the film into conventions it would normally nimbly leap over. The occasional conflict-expanding plot device or bombastic musical interlude, particularly in gearing up for the film's climax, strain convention in ways that are only startling in their inconsistency with the film's customary elegance, while lead actors Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryûnosuke Kamiki, while both lending credibly commanding voices, are as hyperbolic as they come in their grunts, gasps, and other verbalizations reacting to their bizarre circumstances. Still, these are the faintest blemishes on the face of a truly beautiful, touching film, that truly demonstrates that the affective potential of traditional animation still has many wrinkles of uncanny power yet to unfurl. So do yourself a favour: believe the hype. Invest in Your Name. If you have any space amidst the ensuing deluge of feelings, you may just thank yourself you did. -9.5/10"
"This film will leave you speechless - it is quite simply one of the most beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. The animation is breathtaking and possibly the most beautiful animation ever put to screen. There really are no words to capture exactly how it makes you feel because this is simply a film that will move you in inexplicable ways. Sit down, enter the world that Makoto Shinkai has presented to us and soak in all of the magic. Un-be-lievable experience!"
"Let me say first that this piece of art is so impressive to me that I doubt that my words would be sufficient to describe how I feel and think about it. Therefore I will try to use an analogy, so bear with me. But beforehand let me quickly mention that the formal and technical sides of this movie are very good - nothing to complain. There should not be any doubt about that. The drawings are beautiful, the animation is fluid, the colors are well chosen, the music is composed and played gorgeous.Now regarding the content: To me personally it is nothing less than a masterpiece; no way around it. It is not merely a movie it is a piece of art like a poem, like a (metaphysical) parable. It is one of the movies that are enjoyable to think about because they are complete, because they are whole - like a an organism. If a regular narrative is a line this movie is a circle. (not circular)The experiential aspect I can only describe by means of an analogy: like the tongue distinguishes a handful of tastes the soul distinguishes a handful of emotions like joy, sadness, fear, surprise and so on. Something could feel sad like something can taste sweet but that does not say anything about the complex quality behind that sweetness. Just because chocolate and bananas are both sweet does not mean they taste the same. Are you following?Likewise not every sad movie is sad in the same way. It does not have always the sadness of the same kind, it can be of a well composed kind of sadness or of a cheap and poor kind. They taste different. So applied to the movie I can say, without exaggeration, that I have never tasted such rich and well-composed emotions, feelings and thoughts in one movie. Such an exotic taste. Partially this move has something of a myth, it gives you a glimpse of the indescribable. In this case, in ""your name"", time and first love plays a role but again: in an exotic way I have never encountered before. In conclusion: Any adjectives like ""beautiful"" or ""brilliant"" would only cause insufficient associations that wont do justice to that artwork. Just like you wouldn't ever be able to feel the taste of an exotic food or fruit by the mere description you got you cannot even conceptualize how this movies ""tastes"". My recommendation is - taste and see that your name is good!"
"I'll be honest with you, I'm not the biggest fan of anime. Not in the sense that I particularily dislike it but rather in the sense that I haven't seen that many anime shows or movies. Of course I've seen most of the Ghibli films but that's pretty standard even for a normie like me. In terms of Makoto Shinkai I hadn't seen a whiff before I saw Your Name (Kimi no na wa). However this one reached such an unsual amount of praise and attention compared to other anime films that even I got curious after some time. Could this movie be worth all the hype? Could it appeal even to someone relatively unversed in anime? And the answer was a thousand times yes! Your Name contains everything you could ask for out of any movie, not just animated ones. Romance, heart, passion, visual splendor, suspense, humour and much more. Many of these things have been lacking in most recent Hollywood movies as they seem to be getting more and more transparent in how safe they're playing it and how unpassionate their films are. I never thought to look to a whole other culture to find all these things that I've wanted more of for so long, but here we are! Your Name is beautiful in every sense of the word. Firstly from a visual standpoint. By now I've seen quite a few Shinkai movies and they all look really great, but man does he outdo himself here! Every movement looks fluent, every colour is expressive and vibrant, every expression on the faces of the characters looks natural. The whole movies is gorgeous because of all of these things, but the final act is where it really pops thanks to the grand epic scale of what is happening on screen. But perfect visuals are nothing without a good story, and thankfully Your Name has it. You've probably heard that the premise is that a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha start switching bodies inexplicably. I think you should watch this movies with a clear mind, so I won't say anymore, just know that there's more to it than that, and the film takes many unexpected twists and turns. Also I need to touch on the fantastic soundtrack by RADWIMPS. I wasn't sure if their music would work well together with this rather dramatic and lofty premise, but the music is such a perfect fit for the visuals and it always seems to exactly match the emotion that is being created by the scene. I have all the songs on my playlists now and I listen to them practically every day during my spare time, it's that good!By the end of the film I felt like I had had such a complete experience. I had been laughing, I had been moved deeply by the dramatic scenes and I had been gasping at the visual spectacle. I really do not know how anybody could watch this film and end up finding nothing to like, it really does feel like there is something here for everyone. What I ask most of all out of any movie, is to entertain me and to move me, and Your Name did that better than most movies I have ever seen. It really did give me everything I could possibly want!"
Probably the best animaton ever & one of the greatest love story.
"I didn't expect expect to like this movie as much as I did. The animation is stunning, the story is engaging and the movie complements everything perfectly.Watch it, you'll find yourself captivated."
"This anime makes me speechless, I watch this movie with very high expectation from all the reviews I have read and it was worth all of the good reviews out there. The scenes were so beautiful, it makes me want to drawn into it, from the view of the Itomi village to the scenes of the comet falling down, everything was outstanding. I was not expect much about the story, just thought it was some boy & girl love story but then I was wrong, the story is much more than that. It makes me think about people we have met, have forgotten, about how people react to the disasters.That's movie is worth 1.5 hour of your life and I truly hope that it can won an Oscar."
"I overall enjoyed this movie, but after hearing great things it fell flat. Even if I hadn't had any previous knowledge of this movie I still would find it underwhelming.PROS: A decent anime film for people that don't have anything better to compare it too. It's inoffensive/family friendly and enjoyable enough. The natural backgrounds and cityscapes in the film were gorgeous. Once you watch it you won't have to wonder what all the hype is about.CONS: Some of the ideas in the movie presented themselves as if they'd be really complex and interesting, but everything played out in an uninspired way. The two main characters were supposed to be in love, yet there was barely any development there. We never really saw them get to know each other or understood why they even felt anything for one another. There are ways this movie could've done the soulmate trope without making the relationship feel under developed. Also I found the character design to be unappealing, and the random breaks within the narrative to deliver mini music videos seemed like a weird editing choice.If you're looking for a fresh emotional movie with complex characters and an interesting love story this is not it. Watch ""A Silent Voice"" instead. Or any Hayao Miyazaki film.TL;DR: just okay, kinda nice but lacks real heart."
"#Spoiler Free This film could very well be Makoto Shinkai's best film to date. The films excels in creating heartfelt smiles that can turn to tears at the drop of a hat and back again. Similarly to many of his previous works his stories may seem a bit generic and lacking, however this allows the viewer to really focus on the characters and the emotions between them, rather than being caught up in a twisting plot. We are also gifted with Shinkai's train metaphor, however this time unlike 5 cm per second, they show the protagonist journey diverging down separate routes and coming back together all while moving in the same direction to the eventual end of the line.The two protagonists are Taki, a boy from urban Tokyo, and Mitsuha, a girl from a rural Japanese village. Shinkai takes to dull husks and embellishes them into a pair of protagonists with personalities and traits that make them relate able and lovable. The characters chemistry is extremely entertaining and really grows throughout the filmThe beginning of the film succeeds in quickly establishing the characters and there morals, all while creating an attachment between characters and the audience. The films also succeeds in changing pace and direction as soon as things start to get repetitive, allowing the viewers attention to always be grasped and leaving them wanting more. The films fantasy spin keeps things fresh and prevents the film falling into generic slice of life clichés.The art like all of Shinkai's other works it breathtaking, making the film stick in the minds of the audience for long after the films over. Thanks to the detailed artwork the locations and backgrounds are well fleshed out and eye catching making it seem like real life location and not a poor imitation. The soundtrack is done by Radwimps, a Japanese alt rock band, that breathes life and emotion into scenes due to their wide range of styles and atmosphere.Overall i enjoyed the film thoroughly. The fantasy spin really clicked with my tastes and caused me to be engaged and entertain throughout. I also quickly fell in love with the characters and their chemistry together and due to being a similar age related to them both. Thanks to it being one of Shinkai's more happier works i'm now left with a strong desire to watch it again."
"""Your Name"" took a while to get an American release but so anticipation for this film has been rising. Especially since so many say its great!The story centers on two main characters living in Japan whose lives are closely connected. Taki and Mitsuha are both teenage students who wake up in each other's bodies and begin to grow as characters and in their appreciation for each other by living their lives. By far the most astounding aspect of this film is its story and beautifully constructed narrative. The story structure manages to keep its audience on the tip of their toes to focus while never losing itself in convolution. Makoto Shinkai has managed to craft a beautiful story that both touches the heart and makes you laugh out loud (considerably hard at some parts). This blend of drama and comedy make this piece both deeply and emotionally resonating, as well as undeniably enjoyable. The animation itself is a thing of beauty. If anyone has seen the trailer, they know this movie offers beautiful and captivating animation from the very first shot. Hopefully, this film will gain traction in the U.S. considering it truly is one of the most breathtaking film experiences I've ever been a part of. It's become a personal favorite and is definitely the kind of movie that should be praised and seen by as many have the opportunity. Definitely give this a good watch and bring kids to see it too (maybe a bit older kids)!"
I created an IMDB account to comment on this movie. It's amazing.
"So I just had the pleasure of enjoying ""Your Name"" in the cinema and though I could share some thoughts.(May contain very minor spoilers)I've seen many movies trying to pull off the ""two people mysteriously change body with one another"", but I've never seen a movie doing a good job with it. Until now, that is. Makoto Shinkai's ""Your Name (Kimi no na wa)"" has finally succeeded at the task. With a very well deserved rating of 8.6 and 113th placing on the list of 250 top rated movies of all time, ""Your Name"" delivers us anything we could ask from it:A terrific artwork, the movie's animation is extremely well made, with beautiful landscape scenes accompanied with an excellent soundtrack; the sky, sun, water and comets are completely astonishing and mesmerizing to watch. There is even a psychedelic like animation scene halfway through the movie during a critical moment that is deeply touching. Just like in every of Mokoto's movies, the characters are extremely well constructed and it makes you fall in love with them after 10 minutes into the movie, developing a huge emotional bound to the story. The movie had a perfect balance of everything: comedy (which isn't always present on Makoto Shinkai movies, so it was quite pleasant to see it in this one) drama, romance, some mystery, all with a touch of non-linear movie structure. It's the type of movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh while crying The movie's perspective constantly changes between the two main characters, what gave it a very touch and it's not something you see very often.For every anime fan this movie is definitely a must watch, and even for non anime fans I'do recommend to give it a try!"
"I might have found it.I can only describe You Name as masterpiece a term that have only used for a small handful of films that I have watched throughout my life.I've seen Shinkai's previous films which I really enjoyed but this is his greatest work so far. Forget the comparisons to Miyazaki because although Your Name is beautifully animated, has a wonderful score and weaves a engrossing tale it has little in common with Miyazaki's work other than the media - that's not to say it's any lesser piece of work.If you have seen the trailer you'll probably think that this won't will be much different to other body swap films or anime that you might have seen, however Your Name is much more than that and deftly mixes various genres to make a very satisfying whole and everything about this film is pitch perfect.The first act sets up the body swap scenario and this section is sweet, funny and charming. It really helps the audience to get to know and care about the characters while it also mostly sidesteps many of the clichés as the body swap is less about gender and more about city vs countryside, modern vs tradition, dreams vs reality and of course distance.However as the first act comes to a close - just when you think you know where the film is going Miyazaki pulls the rug from under your feet with a twist that you won't see coming (despite some hints). Unlike most films where the 'big twist' seems tacked on or used in an attempt to make something seem clever, the twist in Your Name feels completely organic and deserved.It's here where the tone changes and that kind of shift is really hard to pull off however Miyazaki handles it brilliantly, as the tone shift never jars against the first act it actually compliments it!. The rest of Your Name has an utterly beautiful sense of melancholy and longing which most films would find hard to equal.I don't want to reveal any more about the film as you really need to experience for yourself. Needless to say that the films visuals are gorgeous but special mentions for the editing which I thought was amazing and the score and songs by Radwimps which really helped the film find it's heart.I don't often cry at films especially if it feels they are attempting to force an emotion from me. Beauty or genus tend to make me cry and for the last 15-20 minutes of Your Name tears streamed down my face.Highly recommended, a must see! You don't have to be an Anime fan to enjoy this!"
"For two whole weeks my students have been telling me about this anime, Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name), begging me to check it out. Over the grapevine I also learned that it is the first non-Ghibli non-series based anime movie to earn over 10 billion yen. So last night we did and I have to say it is truly one amazing entertainer with intelligence to boot. It was so good we felt so lost what to see next and so we didn't. We wanted nothing to ruin the unique experience. I will spare everyone the synopsis and plot details because the experience of going into this totally blind is roller-coaster-fantastic. What I will just say is writer-director Makoto Shinkai took some great risks with the narrative and it pays huge dividends in terms of storytelling. This is not something you can sit back and let the story do all the work; you will need to constantly think about what you are seeing, as well as where and when it is all taking place. I love it when a director respects the viewers and brings the game to me. After the electric pace gender bending opening act I have no doubt that like me your mind will throw up the direction of what the narrative will take. You and I would be so wrong. I was gobsmacked at every twist and turn the narrative takes which subverts all my expectations. Shinkai also does a monster mishmash of so many genres that I didn't see when the romantic euphoria ended and when the detective procedural began. He even embeds an element of horror and melancholia. All through this widely imaginative ride he knows where the beating heart is - the relationship between the two star-crossed lovers separated by time and space. Above everything else, the anime captures something so elusive so beautifully. By elusive I mean the temporal seconds you were waking up from a sweet dream, your entire being is still consumed by last night's dream and the memory of it immediately dissipates as you step into the waking world. However, the essence of the dream continues to envelope you throughout the entire day like a cocoon; you will try to hold on to the remnants unsuccessfully. Name one film that got that magical quality spot-on. Shinkai's Kimi No Na Wa got this right many times over. Everyone needs to grab your loved ones and watch this like all your lives depended on it."
"Had Already watched the Japanese version and now watched the English dub version (which had average voice acting/. Still can't get over how amazing this movie is. I was under a lot of depression when I went to watch it , knowing very little about what was at offer. And boy was I entertained! Since then, I've bought the soundtrack album in Japanese, read the novel on which the movie is made and amongst all this , my depression has cured. It's unbelievable! There's nothing wrong with the movie at all! The rating ⁉ 11/10 for me! :P PS those who still don't trust all the positive user reviews should just realize that the metascore is 78! It's not easy at all to get that high number. The bottom line being that it's a roller coaster ride of emotions that is bound to make a long lasting impact upon you. Highly recommend watching it in Japanese as that's how the director wants us to see it."
"'kimi no na wa' is the recent addition to Shinkai collection which is a phenomenal success overnight but box office collection doesn't decide the quality of the film, the film like twilight earned in tons. Is it overrated?Yes,highly. Is it masterpiece?HAHAHHA,only if twilight is your favorite love story,on serious note just average.STORY-First of all the plot isn't original, to begin with,I could relate a lot of work that gives close resemblance. Let's start with ""Ditto"" a Korean film where two people living twenty-one years apart in time able to contact each other through radio or ""Lake House"" an American film with the same concept but the time difference is two years and mean of communication is through letters. Bringing another work to notice, 'It's a Boy Girl Thing"" Where two individuals swapped bodies,adapted to their surroundings and over time fall in love. How does it sound? Finally mixed it up with Japanese settings and some unexplainable science fiction stuff,here comes the idea of masterminded plot for ""Kimi no na wa""SUMMING UP ALL THE POINTS IN SHORT-SUMMING UP ALL THE POINTS- (*) Promising start,entertaining to watch but nothing explain why they were swapping,they didn't even check the dates nor contacted each other for real,you didn't even care to look for the place where the girl is in neither the girl care to look for the boy. Plot convenience. (*)A strange girl gave you braided cord in train and you don't even know her,why care to keep it for three years?Plot convenience. (*)The relationship between the main characters were so vague,I know this is Shinkai's usual style but for a change I thought he'll give us something more but it turn out another cliché romance,I wonder if the use of word ""romance"" is right or not. Neither of them knows each other for real,just share the empty shell and experience each other lifestyle,suddenly feeling started to burst out from where? WOW. (*)The way he time travel back to save her,the way he convinced the friends in her bodies,the final execution to evacuate the village all feel so foolish and out of the line. (*)confusion of different timeline- It's the most complicated part,Mitsuha's timeline was parallel to Taki's timeline of three years ago,she eventually died over there. But the taki that had the body swapping and all the interaction with her is the one in the future three years ahead,so when he realized that he fall in despair and tried one last time to change the past and he succeeds in the most unrealistic way ever,anyway the thing is that what happen to two different timelines,did they merge or separated?we never got an explanation of that,it's like thing happens so let move on and observe the emotion not the logic behind it. If we bring the first couple of minutes in the film,we get a clear image what trigger the emptiness inside them,the feeling of missing something important in their life,it was since the day meteor pass by. -Taki in the current timeline never had the feeling before he interacted with her and even he had no knowledge of the meteor and stuff,he wakes up with vague memories in the mountain after the effort to save her whereas taki's of the different timeline was shown to have all the knowledge of the incident and even had the empty feeling ever since that day. For mitsuha,she might have more reference to what happen as in the ending,when taki asked her ""if they ever met"",the way mitsuha reacted to give a good idea of that. The emotions aspect can never overshadow such part. MUSIC AND ANIMATION-Stunning visual with shivering music by ""RADWIMPS"",literally the combination of this two somewhat make the the film enjoyable overshadowing the weak plot.ENJOYMENT-I got a mixed feeling about this,I thought it'll make me laugh,cry and would be a whole different experience for me,I did enjoy in the in the first half but as soon it progresses,It felt like the plot was trying too hard and with all those illogical stuff going on,nothing much to say.OVERALL-A decent film with pretty colors, the execution was good too but no near perfect, just above average.STOP LETTING YOUR EMOTION GET THE BEST OF YOU AND JUDGE LOGICALLY."
"THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE STORY. EVERYTHING ELSE (ART, SECONDARY CHARACTERS, ATMOSPHERE) IS GREAT.A boy and a girl discover that some days, their lives are swapped, which they only remember as dreams afterwards.You see the love story coming between those two ? Color me naive, but I didn't.First, it's one of the most contrived premises you could have for a love story. Second, there's like a million stories you could tell with such a premise, why take the less original ? Of all the funny, awkward, insightful etc. things that could happen to two people who exchange lives, why go for the most clichéd ?But OK, let's accept that they fall in love with each other. After all, a lot of the emotional impact of the second half of the movie hinges on their being infatuated with each other. But we're never shown that happen ! The most we're shown for Mitsuha (the girl) is that she takes an interest in Taki's (the boy) life. I guess it could count as both reason and show of her growing fondness for him. As limited as it is, at least it's a small hint that something's happening.We're not so lucky with Taki.After his date with his female coworker, she guesses that he's recently fallen for another woman. At that point I thought she guessed wrong, because nothing we see supports that idea. But I'm more and more convinced that she's conveying the message of the authors : at that moment, they're flatly informing us that Taki is falling for Mitsuha.What do they say again in storytelling school ? ""Show, don't tell."" Well, it's a typical example of telling, not showing.It's like the movie is trolling us : ""Oh, btw, Taki's totally into Mitsuha now ! A lot of stuff happened, but we didn't think it was worth showing, even though ALL we're showing you are those 2 very characters. U mad ?""Just to be clear, I'm not saying that he has no reason for falling in love. He has plenty ! If you've seen the movie, here's a quick quiz. Taki falls in love with Mitsuha because :a) he's attracted by her looksb) he's impressed by her skillsc) he's thankful for her helpd) he remembers their first encounter in the subwaye) they're soulmatesf) any of the other bazillion possible reasons ?You don't know ? Nobody does ! Because we don't see their love bloom.As it is, this love story misses its core, its pivotal moment. It's a love story without romance.Little annoyances :Memories and messages appear and disappear so as to fit the plot's needs so perfectly that we have left the lands of Plot Convenience to enter the realm of Plot Laziness.The second part is so clichéd that at any point you can safely guess what happens in the next 15 minutes.Mitsuha convinces her father at the end in a deeply moving and insightful argument. Well, I guess, because we're TOLD, NOT SHOWN (uuuuugh)"
"I feel like this film was divinely inspired. It is beautiful, yet otherworldly. Without even trying, it hits hidden chords within the human psyche that bring out a torrent of feelings that we never knew we had, or had long forgotten about. When I watched it with my friends, who are normally chatty and sarcastic during movies - they were completely silent, awestruck immersed wholeheartedly. They were quiet, save for a few ""wows!"" at the beauty and detail of the art in this film. When the credits came, they were still so enthralled they just watched the credit roll, without moving or wanting desperately to rush back to their busy lives and schedules. This movie nourished our souls and gave us something we didn't know we needed. We didn't know movies could be this profound, this touching, this meaningful. Think of the most touching and beautiful movie/scene you've ever seen, and loved, and it still doesn't come close to what this film has. Calling it a masterpiece isn't enough. It was more than a masterpiece. 10 as a rating isn't enough, either. There is no number great enough to pay back what this film has given me."
"Oh, and gorgeously animated.I think that's a fair way to sum up this movie. It starts out as a fantasy and, as it reveals more puzzle pieces, you realize it's more science fiction. There are tightly plotted reasons for everything that's going on, all of which are revealed in good time.Like like all good puzzle movies, there's a thrill every time something is revealed that ties things together. It's complex enough that you want to see it again immediately, but no so complex that you have any doubt as to what basically happened.Like Donnie Darko, while it's busy scrambling your head and keeping you guessing, it is somehow managing to be deep, both emotionally and thematically (the latter drawing on Japanese culture and religion). Unlike Donnie Darko, it's never dark and disturbing in a creepy way, although there is plenty of danger and peril. Instead, it radiates sweetness and love, without ever becoming saccharine.Donnie Darko is one of my two or three favorite films of all time, so this is high praise. Of all the films I've seen since, nothing has come closer to matching its combination of thrilling revelations, emotional resonance, and thematic depth than Your Name."
"The best way I can describe the quality of this anime is that, halfway into the view, I had to watch the end to make sure it wasn't a 5mm/sec thing. First: we find a perfect integration with the previous works, in a very gentle way. I jumped up when I saw the name of the Italian restaurant, for example, or the teacher... a zen garden of references. Second: it covers all emotions within the human spectrum of feelings. From funny to desperate to hatred. Amazing how the characters, and the plot, move so naturally from one state of mind to another. Nothing dramatic has to happen: it's all so natural. Third: the plot is original and unpredictable. ""You never know what you are gonna get next"". Fourth: sometimes it's not the devil, hiding into details, but perfection. This is it, I could go on for hours. This anime shocked me in a very positive way. Work of genius."

"A late contender but strong contender for one of the best films I've seen in 2016 and maybe even thus far. (I've never starred a film before but by God this one deserves it!) ""Your Name"" is a feature film Japanese anime so it's for those who can tolerate foreign films and animation. And by animation I mean painstakingly breath-taking animation that goes from encapsulating almost photo-realistically vibrant sunsets to the slightest twitch in expression giving soul to the characters before us.I'm not one to judge anime but I'll say this: of the little I've watched, never have I seen such detailed artwork, animation so real and voice acting so fitting that the characters are so alive that you genuinely wish that they were. The consistent top-notch animation, artwork, soundtrack, directing and even the voice acting was clearly done with love and care to the point that the finished film looks and feels like a passion project without a deadline striving for perfection.Oh and it's not just looks too it's got brains as well. I was hooked on the plot from the beginning and although I can't comment on the amazing plot without ruining it, you should expect a drama/romance/fantasy. I guess you're just going to have to take a leap of faith here... Even if the plot sounds a little 90s.It was a spectacle to watch unfold, it made me laugh, it made me cry, it had me fully invested from start to finish and most importantly, it made me feel. I don't think one can ask for more in a film."
"I had high expectations for Your Name. Not only because I have thoroughly enjoyed Makoto Shinkai's previous films, but also because it has been doing incredibly well at the Japanese box office the past few months.While I think Shinkai's previous films are great, none of them quite reached masterpiece levels for me, but I'm very happy to say that Your Name did that, because not only is this without a doubt Shinkai's best work to date, this is easily one of the best Anime films I have ever seen.I don't want to go give away too much detail about the plot, but all I will say is that this is an incredibly written and very original story, with fantastic animation (as you would expect from Shinkai), along with lovable characters, funny humour, a great music score and a final act that will surely have you waiting to see what transpires with deep emotional investment.What starts off as a funny body-switch comedy turns into something much more deeper and emotional in the 2nd half, but I won't give anything away!It's now one of my top 5 favourite Anime films and I encourage everyone, regardless of whether you're an Anime fan or not, to check out this masterpiece."
Best Anime Movie ever. Fantasy connects love and shakes your heart.
"My heart stopped at least 20 times watching this movie. It was so emotional, so interesting, so odd, so beautiful I don't even know if I can find enough words to express how good it really was. The story was absolutely fantastic and the soundtrack fits it perfectly. I'm not the kind that cries during movies but this one had me in tears for like 20 minutes. It's a must!"
"I didn't find this as elegant or refined as Miyazaki's best work, but I thought it was much more emotionally powerful. Seeing it with a good audience helps: I was moved when someone in the theater audibly gasped and involuntarily wailed ""No!"" at one point in the movie. She spoke for all of us, because we were all bound up as one in that moment. That's a great movie."
"Your Name, also known as Kimi no na wa, is an anime film is directed by Makoto Shinkai and it is based on the book written by Shinkai. It tells the story of a boy named Taki, a high school boy who lives in Tokyo who out of some bizarre miracle, begins switching bodies repeatedly with a high school girl named Mitsuha who lives out in the country. The two learn about one another through various hi- jinks and need to find a way to pair up and stop something from happening.The movie was English dubbed by Funimation and came to select theaters in North America for a week and I have been dying to see this after hearing about all the buzz regarding it, and I'm not going to lie, this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. So, how did I feel about the movie after seeing it? If you couldn't guess by the rating, I loved it!The movie was incredibly engaging and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The story is simply immersive, with many surprising twists and turns along the way that can really bring you into the experience. The mystery of the movie is an element that really drew me in, and it lead to me thinking of some questions that eventually got answered as the movie pressed on. The movie is very emotional with many scenes that will send you The interaction between our two leads Taki and Mitsuha is definitely strange to say the least, but in a good way, even if their interactions are awkward. I'm just going to leave the explanation regarding the story and characters off right here because it's hard for me not to review this particular film without talking about the film in-depth.The animation is fantastic to look at as well. The designs for the back grounds in particular really gave me a feel for what the city in the country looks like as well as what Tokyo looks like. The CGI does a surprisingly good job at blending in with the traditional animation. Even the movements of the characters look natural, as well as the environments. Even though the art style is no new anime art style, it still is a very well polished one. During one scene, the art style goes through a major change that would last for a few minutes and personally I loved the change. I loved the vocal songs that were featured in the movie. As someone who isn't a fan of modern music, I found them quite refreshing, even if they are just English dubbed.Your Name is simply a fantastic movie experience regardless of whether you're an anime fan or not. It's really easy to see why it gained critical acclaim in Japan and multiple awards. The story is incredibly gripping and our two lead characters are both very interesting and very likable. The animation is beautiful from start to finish and the vocal songs felt refreshing. I'll be honest, it was very hard to find a legitimate flaw with the movie. However, if I do have one legitimate criticism towards the film, it's that the film starts off pretty slowly and is not as engaging as it is later on. However, I can afford to forget about that since it didn't bother me that much. While it's in theaters for a limited amount of time, go see it. This film has to be seen to be believed.If I could make a recommendation however, I do think the movie is more suitable to older audiences in spite of the PG rating. I wouldn't recommend the movie to those under the age of 10 due to some suggestive themes that might not be appropriate for audiences under that age. If you do plan to bring kids under the age limit, make sure to keep an eye out for them."
"The animation in this movie was absolutely amazing ! Even though people may discount the movie since it's animated but I really recommended everyone to watch. Some parts were humorous, other parts mysterious but the connection that forms is so beautiful and unreal. You really end up embarking on the journey with the characters to discover these beautiful scenery and unravelling truths, it's astounding!"
"When the movie started, I was a bit disoriented, as the first few scenes had fast cuts, and I hadn't been grounded yet. There is a lot of time travel and this does get confusing throughout the film, but I wasn't very bothered by it. I'd say that the constant time shifts actually add to the mystery of the story, as you're always trying to figure out where in the timeline you've jumped to. The animation is great, with vivid colors and great lighting effects. I can't imagine how difficult and time consuming it is to make graphics look realistic. I just enjoy the finished product. Very detailed work. I think there is more of a 3D depth to anime than there is with cartoons. Just something about their technique gives it so much more aesthetics. Or perhaps it is also the vast range of colors that are used. The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, and that's what makes it so magical. Anything can happen next, and you don't see it coming. I was thoroughly invested with the story and found the script to be both comedic and culturally aware. The two main characters are quite different from each other, but both are headstrong and their stubbornness is fun to watch. Overall, this is a great fantastical film to watch, for both the old and the young."
"Your Name. follows a boy and girl who randomly begin to switch bodies, and how their relationship develops through that. There's a lot more to this movie than I can say, because around the halfway point everything changes and it becomes much more than a simple feel good movie. And that's what it is for the first third. It's quirky, fun, cute, all that. It's not great, but it's really enjoyable.The second that aspect of the movie ends the movie begins its quick ascent to one of the best movies I've ever seen. It builds the characters and their relationship well and by this time we're already attached to them well enough, but then something happens. There's a huge plot twist in this movie that, put simply, blew my mind. And moreover, made me tear up a little. From there on it just gets better and better, writing-wise. The movie doesn't just have a great story though. For starters, the animation is beautiful. And it isn't just pretty paintings and scenery (though there are), the imagery is also unique in some scenes, where what is being shown isn't completely natural but it looks cool anyway. At the same time, it isn't just mindless artsy- fartsy crap, it actually has relevance and symbolism and stuff. The movie's soundtrack proves to be quite good too. A song plays every once in a while, and all of them are well-suited to the movie and just sound nice. I don't think I'd listen to them outside of the movie, but I like them nonetheless.Something that really stood out to me was how realistic it could be. Sure, it feeds off of plenty of things that would only happen in an anime world, but it doesn't rely on those. The characters act in realistic ways and say things you'd expect them to say, all without removing the anime charm entirely. I always think it's cool to see a movie with a few confusing scenes, then see everything come together at the end, making all those scenes make sense. Your Name. has plenty of those. There are scenes that you kind of just forget about but then they come up again later and you realize that this was all thought out well before the movie was made, and it really shows just how much effort was put into the movie in the first place. It's clear that it's trying to be something more. It's trying to be complex, and it actually is. The movie isn't too terribly hard to understand, but it does require you to think at least a little to fully get it. Overall Your Name. is an anime that excels in every aspect of it. The writing is fantastic, the characters are fun and lovable yet realistic, the soundtrack is well-suited, it's beautiful to look at, and it makes you think just enough that it isn't overly confusing, but enough to still make it complex. In the end this isn't just one of the best anime films, this is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to just about anyone."
"I don't normally review a movie, in fact this will be my first time. The reason that I needed to make one because I was astonished with something that I just watched, and I feel that people need to watch it too.Great story line with twists here and there, great characters and development, supported by excellent animation and music.I came to the cinema with the expectation of this movie would be as good as 5 cm per second, in fact it surpassed my expectation. I could not even remember when was the last time I watch a movie without checking my watch, which means that every single minutes, from beginning till the end, the scenes were very enjoyable and well fit in to the whole flow of the story.This movie also reminded that how great Japanese movies in Asia were before Korean movies started coming to scene. Honestly speaking Japanese animate will still be my number one pick when it comes to animation.In conclusion, this is a must watch for everybody, whether you like anime or not. Highly recommended!"
Not often I feel the sensation of the unknown. That's what i like to call it at least. Whenever i think or see something supernatural to the extent it scares me. I felt this feeling through a lot of this film. Beautiful. Magical. Mesmerising. The greatest animation of all time.
This movie will intrigue you from start to finish. i can not say it any simpler that that.cause i may get started on a rant of how good it is
"Makoto Shinkai's Your Name is my third favourite animated movie of all time, only being surpassed by Kaufman's Anomalisa and Miyazaki's Spirited Away. It is a masterfully crafted film that tells a simple story that manages to be fresh, intriguing, and beautiful throughout the entirety of its hour and fifty-two minute runtime. Shinkai somehow takes an idea that has been done a million times and gives it a fresh, new take that hasn't been done before. Some people will call his films melodramatic or petty, but what some people see as pretentious, I see as a stroke of pure genius. I am not only going to discuss why I believe that Your Name is masterclass filmmaking, but why Makoto Shinkai is a legend in the works. Firstly, I am going to go over my history with the film, and my initial reaction to seeing it. The first time I heard of Your Name was back in late 2016. I watched a movie review on the flick from one of my personal favourite film critics, Chris Stuckmann. I've always respected him and trusted his opinion, as we share the same fondness for movies and have a similar taste in film. I was quite surprised when he gave Your Name his highest score, an A+, and recommended it highly. I was very intrigued by his synopsis of the film and immediately sought it out. To my dismay however, I could not find the screening for the movie anywhere. Since I couldn't go see it in a theatre, I decided to wait for the DVD release of the movie, which was in April. I put it on my IMDB watchlist and patiently waited until I got my hands on the film and got to finally watch it. I didn't know much about the film going into it, although I was excited to see it, I deliberately kept myself as far from marketing and discussions on the film as I prefer to go into a movie as blind as possible. When I did get to see it, not only did Your Name meet my expectations and live up to the praise, but it did something more. Something else I didn't expect it to do. It wasn't only a good film, it was a phenomenal one. My hopes for the movie were quite high, and it still managed to be even better than I originally thought.Your Name starts with a fantastic scene that hooks the audience immediately after the movie starts. It's a scene that on first watch doesn't really make any sense, but upon revisiting, the movie, it is foreshadowing for the twist and end of the movie; the end is in the beginning. The next scene follows a girl going through her daily life, but everything seems off. Even though you've never seen this character, you still understand that there is something strange happening from hints from other characters and the girl's reaction to them. Shinkai puts the viewer inside of the shoes of this girl, in which we are in the same confused state as this girl. This makes the first scene feel like a dream which I am pretty sure is what he intended. The same scene is repeated, but instead it is a boy. We eventually learn that the boy (Taki) and the girl (Mitsuha) are actually swapping bodies, and they try to live their lives as the other person would want them to but there are conflicts. This makes for some really inventive and unique humour that gives the film levity. Later in the flick, the plot twist is revealed and it really works since it is not only creative and unexpected, but as handled really well. You feel the impact of those events on the characters, as well as the audience itself. On paper, this film has been done before, but execution-wise, this movie really nails it. Your Name is an idea that we have seen time and time again, but thanks to Shinkai, it has been done fantastically. Everything about this movie is great, from the animation to the cinematography. I'm going to go over why these things and are as great as they are. Firstly, the animation. This one is pretty self-explanatory once you see the movie. Every single shot is drawn gorgeously, especially the scenery. Shinkai is proven time and time again that he knows how to make some great looking backgrounds, and this film is no exception. This movie uses both hand-drawn and CG animation, and they are both used expertly. There isn't a single frame where I thought they were being lazy or not trying, the animation is on par with something like Studio Ghibli. Everything from the character designs to the scenery, looks phenomenal. Secondly, the story. I've already gone through it, so I won't say much other than it could have been a terrible movie, but thanks to Shinkai, it doesn't suck total balls. Next, the cinematography. The cinematography was pretty good in this movie. Even if it didn't blow me away, it was still really good looking. There were a lot of interesting shots in the film that weren't just for show, but actually had some meaning behind them. I really enjoy when directors add those few extra layers for film fans to dissect. That brings me to my next topic--the hidden meanings in the movie. As a big movie fan I love having more to chew on after the movie is over, and having to rewatch it to get everything. Some of my favourite movies are The Holy Mountain and Synecdoche New York, films that have tons of symbolism and need multiple watches to get everything. However, you can still enjoy these movies even if you don't understand everything, which is why I love them so much. Your Name may not be as deep as these movies and have as many layers as those movies, but it still has enough that analysing the movie is still a fun task. Finally, the score and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking in this movie. This is one of my favourite japanese musical compositions in a movie since Hausu. I adore the music used in this movie and listen to it constantly. The music was done by a group called Radwimps, and although I haven't listened to their other music, I definitely want to check them out at some point. Those are the best parts of the movie. I didn't cover everything like the voice acting or characters, but that's because, though they were also good, they weren't as great as the other aspects of the movie. Nevertheless, there is still one more thing I would like to cover, that being the man behind the camera, Makoto Shinkai.Makoto Shinkai is an absolute madman. He went from making short films by himself to directing feature-length movies in the span of just two years. For comparison's sake, Hayao Miyazaki worked in the business for almost 20 years before his first feature. Shinkai isn't just really lucky, but also very talented and creative. All of his work that I have seen of his been pretty outstanding, even though I haven't seen all of his work. I really enjoyed Voices of a Distant Star, but I especially really liked both 5 Centimeters per Second and The Garden of Words. I still have yet to check out The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices, but they are really high up on my IMDB watchlist and I am really looking forward to watching them. People say that Shinkai could be the next Miyazaki, and to that I say, ""Yeah, maybe."" Even though he's not currently working on a new project, I seriously can't wait to see what Shinkai cooks up next.In conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece in terms of film making and if anyone other than the man himself crowned the director's chair, it probably wouldn't be nearly as good as it was. In short, Makoto Shinkai is a goddamn legend."
