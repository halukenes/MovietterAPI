"I decided to watch Grave of the Fireflies yesterday. My friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. I hesitated at first, but then I said ""Oh well, I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I've ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.I am kind of upset, that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.Quite Simply 10/10"
"I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago.  It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions.  At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up.  It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to ""decompress"" after watching it.  To see it too often would lessen the impact, and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie."
"When I watched this movie, I steeled myself for a traumatic experience, based on every review I'd ever read of it, which usually include phrases like ""don't watch this if you're suicidal."" Instead, if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw, it would probably be 'beautiful'.Certainly it was sad, and arguably depressing, but I've read this movie compared with 'Saving Private Ryan'. That's ridiculous. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is gentle and poetic more often than it's violent, and it's remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. It simply tells a story : there's very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics. Why would a story like this need such heavy-handed tactics?I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead. I have a quite different view of that device.Firstly. the beginning of 'Fireflies' is, for all intents and purposes, a 'happy ending'. This is such a non-linear plot development that you could fail to notice it, and thereby only see the movie's gloom. The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie, this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena. The crucial thing here is that 'Fireflies' isn't _about_ tension. It tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know (a legitimate narrative approach), and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending. You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power. You know the characters are going to die, but you hope things won't be so bad in the meantime. It doesn't take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives, which makes us all fireflies.Perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that it's so damn honest. I mean that: it's one of the most honest, artifice-free movies I've ever seen. It doesn't even really try to ram an anti-war message down your throat there is very little overt violence, and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering, it's never gratuitous, and it's over quickly. Compare this with 'Private Ryan', where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts, only to reach a conclusion which, after much blood and thunder, signifies very little.'Fireflies', OTOH, has far more beauty than gore. This is what really surprised me about it. Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn, tranquil rural or urban settings, with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal, almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.Perhaps best of all, Setsuko is one of the very, very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-old I've ever seen who actually _behaves_ like a four year old. I'm so sick of seeing preternaturally smart, sassy, sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko's emotion and behaviors are _exactly_ right for a completely normal four year-old, and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy. Similarly, Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride, compassion and hubris which you'd expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer's advice, swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead, was a very bad one, but - hello, people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he's actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation, who doesn't miraculously save the day, because his best judgment just isn't good enough.Of course, his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway. Who knows?Don't go into the film expecting tension, drama or even a tirade against war. It's a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth. If you think Japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls, this could be the film which changes your mind. It's slow, poetic, beautiful and sad, and extraordinarily honest.I must be the only person who didn't cry during this film (and I mean, I get choked up during some Disney movies). Yes, it is sad, but its beauty and honesty is what I'll remember.NB: this review refers to the subtitled version of the film."
"I was warned this movie would be emotional, but I had no idea just how understated that was.  By the end, my friend and I were huddled together, pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before.  It was a mix of horror, empathy, sadness, and so many more emotions I can't even begin to list.Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching. Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it's strong emotions again (The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover).I strongly urge all to watch this, as it rises well about any films I've seen, anime or not."
"Occasionally there's a film that literally changes one's perceptions of the world.   `Grave of the Fireflies' is one of those films.    No movie ever made generates such an intense and powerful emotional response as this one. 
It's an animated film set in Japan during the closing days of World War II. Two children; a boy named Seita and his much younger sister Setsuko; must quickly learn to cope with life after their mother is killed during a fire-bombing raid by American B-29's.    The film starts with the children and their mother preparing for the attack, then follows the children as they attempt to survive the death of their mother, and the possible death of their father, a naval officer serving aboard the Japanese heavy cruiser `Maya.'  (A US submarine torpedoed the `Maya' in late October of 1944 during the battle of Leyte Gulf.)The story of two orphans trying to survive in war-ravaged Japan is not the subject of your typical light-hearted animated film.   In fact it may be much too serious for anyone under the age of 14.  The first five minutes of the film hits one like a sledgehammer  by far the most emotional opening scene I've ever come across.  I found myself already reaching for the tissues, and trying to choke back the tears.Yet there's more than just tragedy in `Grave of the Fireflies.' It is the most awesome love story one is ever likely to see.  But it's far from the typical Hollywood idea of a love story.   Instead of the usual highly attractive Hollywood actors of the opposite sex pining for one another in front of the camera, we have an animated Japanese brother and his much younger little sister.   It's not a tale of romantic love, but one of `brotherly' love.  Seita loves his little sister, and once he discovers that his mother has been killed in the bombing, he does everything he can to keep his sister from finding out about her horrible death.   Then, with typical Japanese seriousness, he begins to immediately provide for and comfort Setsuko; she being the only member of his immediate family he has left.   Though not stated in the film, it seems obvious that part of Seita's motivation for looking so carefully after his sister has to do with avoiding his own pain and despair having been left with NOTHING after the bombing attack.   No mother, no father, no home.   The war Japan is waging against the rest of the world takes its toll on these two little ones, without regard for their feelings or emotions.That which truly broke my heart into ten thousand tiny pieces was the selfless way Seita looked after his younger sister, and shielded her from the horrors all around, especially the lack of food.  Films show us many things, some good, some evil, but rarely has any film shown how one person so unselfishly puts another ahead of them self.   Seita does makes some mistakes in the way he goes about taking care of his sister, but I can't fault him for his love and his devotion.   Who of us have always chosen the best path, the most perfect way of doing things?   Surely not I!   Seita's obvious love and devotion to Setsuko is the most moving and convicting thing I've ever come across on film. I use the word `convicting' because this movie convicted me of my own very selfish nature.   `Grave of the Fireflies' caused me sadness not just because of Seita's brave attempts to take care of his little sister; but because he gave of himself so totally and completely, even though his sister was a liability to his own survival.   I could not help to be convicted concerning all the many times there have been family and friends who have needed my help or understanding, but I ignored them in favor of `doing my own thing.'   How sad I am for all those times I've ignored the suffering of others and their cries for help.   This film showed the evil in my own heart  something that I would not have noticed on my own.  But now that the blinders have been removed, I can repent of my selfishness, and look for ways to help others, instead of avoiding them. Some Japanese anime I've seen are very much anti-American.  But even though it's the Americans dropping the bombs in this film, there is no overt anti-American message.   In many ways, the Japanese civilians are shown in as bad a light as is the American air and naval forces!   Their hard hearts and stubborn ways are displayed on the screen without apology; and one can see how the plight of the two children is made even worst by the selfishness of the adults that they have come to rely upon. It would be easy for someone from `the West' (i.e. the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, etc.) to think that the two children depicted in this animated marvel were the exception, rather than the rule.  They lived in very trying times, and surely children in this day and age do not have to go through experiences similar to Seita's and Setsuko's.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.   There are still major problems with orphans and unwanted children in the former communist block countries of Eastern Europe and Russia itself.  There are also large numbers of unwanted children roaming the streets of China, India, Mongolia, and various other Asian nations.   We may not here about it on the news, or hear our friends talk about it; but I assure you that there are literally millions of children around the world whose situation is no better, if not much worst than that of Seita and Setsuko.      I am very thankful I had the honor of watching this film.   I'm also very thankful for the people who put it together.   But most of all, I'm very thankful for the positive impact it has had on my life."
"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira,"" or ""Princess Mononoke,"" or ""Spirited Away"" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is ""Grave of the Fireflies.""What we have with ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the ""Schindler's List"" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone."
"This film is utterly emotionally draining whilst being rewarding at the same time.The animation is both realistic and stylized but that's not the point, the main focus of this film is the character development of the brother and sister protagonists. Their relationship is nothing short of beautiful and touching.And without spoiling anything I have to say that this film touched me in a way no other film has ever touched me in my adult life. One or two films have upset me and reduced me to watery eyes but Grave of the Fireflies had me in fits of sobbing despair. I was a mess! I'm talking total emotional breakdown. Couldn't talk without sobbing! One of the best films I have EVER seen, animated or not."
"Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli. Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.Set in the aftermath of World War II, Graveyard is focused on the lives of a caring brother and his young sister (Setsuko and Seita) and how they struggle against both the elements of wartime and a depreciating Japanese empire. The most striking thing about Graveyard is probably how real everything seems. The animation is very unconventional to the likes of say Spirited Away or Laputa but in a good way. The horror of war is beautifully realised through the animation, whether it be the American destruction being shown or the bleak outlook on peoples lives, namely the two main characters. Thankfully it earns every shred of emotion it conveys through these two sympathetic characters that only the coldest of hearts wouldn't warm up to.
Avoiding any Hollywood sentimentality, it is often a bleak and depressing perspective depicted but all the more brutally powerful in the process. With my eyes welling up through the duration of the film, it occured to me just how well the Director understands what raw heartfelt emotion is and how to play the audiences heart strings. Nevertheless nothing is shown in a heavy handed approach, no empthasis is put on the Americans nor is there any special attention taken to the war details. If anything the citizens of Japan are shown in the coldest light often giving little help to the plight of others, but demonstrating furthermore what desperate situation everyone is in.Takahata instead decides to focus on the plight of it's title characters against the background of war. With the empire of Japan in crisis and food shortages everywhere it is heart breaking to see a brother struggle to meet ends meet for his sister. Due to the approach taken it borders on being horrifying but fortunately the tone is changed with the spirit put into Setsuko's character. Much like 'The Pianist' the issue is not the war but the struggle and will to survive in it. This is clearly displayed in a plot that revolves around the downward spiral Setsuko trying to feed himself and more importantly the younger and more vulnerable sister Seita. The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly. It's the perfect mixture of such animation, realistic and highly likeable characters that makes the whole film one tearful experience. Dealing with such difficult issues it's very hard to imagine this being a film and if it was I don't think it would of been done as well.Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction. The child, Seita, is nothing short of perfection in child like behaviour happily oblivious to the desperate situation, amusing herself with simplicity and the quirks of nature and the outdoors. The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least. To struggle is one thing but to have shock, shattered dreams and be depended on is something anyone can empthasise with.
There may be some people who will shy away from Anime, disregarding it as a mere cartoon. To those people and everyone else I recommend Graveyard as the tonic, which can be appreciated by anyone with a heart and soul. Among the finest pieces of Anime created and one of the most touching war films ever made."
"""September 21, 1945...That was the night I died.""-- SeitaReading war statistics and even seeing bloody images on television does not fully communicate the horror of war as well as the heartbreaking Grave of the Fireflies, an anime feature directed by Isao Takahata, a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki. The film tells the story of two children, Seita, a 14-year old boy and Setsuko, his 4-year old sister and their uphill struggle to survive the effects of American firebombing in Kobe near the end of World War II. Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave is a powerful experience that powerfully communicates the strength of the human spirit to carry on against overwhelming odds.
Though despairing, the film does not resort to cheap melodrama to achieve its effect but delineates simple and direct images that are not watered-down to appeal to the children's market. It would indeed be too sad for most children under 13. In an interview with Cedric Littardi, AnimeLand magazine from 1992, Takahata said that he did not set out to depress the audience but to show a natural death, as opposed to a ""scientific"" death, the way most of us view it -- behind closed curtains in a sanitized hospital.
Takahata in some ways softens the impact of the tragedy at the outset by showing Seita dying outside a subway station and his spirit reunited with his little sister Setsuko. The story is told by flashback as the two children are left alone to fend for themselves when their mother is killed in the bombing campaign. When their father is also killed in the Navy, they must struggle against starvation, the cruelty of an aunt they trusted, people's general indifference, and their own pride. Though both children eventually succumb to malnutrition (or radiation poisoning), the animation is so lyrical that it creates a magical, dream-like effect. This does not mask the tragedy but makes it all the more poignant. Nothing sums up the message of this film better than the beautiful poem, ""I Come and Stand at Every Door"" by Nazim Hikmat, one of the most important and influential figures in 20th-century Turkish literature.
I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent tread. I knock and yet remain unseen. For I am dead, for I am dead.I'm only seven although I died. In Hiroshima long ago. I'm seven now as I was then. When children die they do not grow.My hair was scorched by swirling flame. My eyes grew dim, my eyes grew blind. Death came and turned my bones to dust. And that was scattered by the wind.I need no fruit, I need no rice. I need no sweet, nor even bread. I ask for nothing for myself. For I am dead, for I am dead.All that I ask is that for peace. You fight today, you fight today. So that the children of this world. May live and grow and laugh and play.	-- Nazim HikmetIn our day where our leaders are busily preparing for another war, it is important to remember the human cost of these plans and the untold suffering they will inevitably bring. Grave of the Fireflies should be required viewing in the Oval office."
"This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.The story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun or even Schindler's List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we're not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.This is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren't moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10"
"During my searches on Anime on the net one day I came across this title. This was 2 years ago.Then last week I went to an Anime convention and at the DVD stand I saw it. I bought it immediately.When I got home 3 days later I popped it in. I was warned about it being tragic but nothing could have prepared me for the wave of emotion that hit me while watching it. I was depressed for a whole day. Even thinking about it made me cry..This is the power of Grave Of The Fireflies..This is not your typical Dragonball Z/Sailormoon/Pokemon style anime. While I love Sailormoon and some Dragonball Z, Grave Of The Fireflies surpasses it by lightyears. I bought it expecting an epic movie like Ghost In The Shell or Akira but even those paled compared to this.We have here a story of a 14 year old boy(Seita) who loses his mother in a firebombing during World War 2. He then has to take care of his 4 year old sister(Setsuko). While at first they're taken in by his aunt the relationship between him and his aunt takes a turn for the worst. He then ends up on the street and the struggle begins... It doesn't take a genious to figure out that things get really depressing, yet I won't spoil the ending..All I have left to say is that you have to see this movie.. It's the most powerful movie I've ever seen... It's painful to watch but still you have to see it..."
"**SPOILERS**I saw ""Hotaro no haka"" on german TV the other day and it has changed my life! Never have I been so moved by a film in my whole life. I cried and cried and cried. Since then I can´t get this heartbreaking story out of my head.After the movie I went upstairs to the bedroom, where my 3-year-old daughter was sleeping. I woke her up and took her in my arms. In the way she talks and acts she is just like Setsuko, one of the main characters in the film. And I can´t help feeling like Seita, her brother - because my daughter and I are alone since my wife left us a few months ago.I found one of the most touching scenes was the one where the dying Setsuko starts sucking the buttons she collected, because she ran out of her special sweets. I will also never forget how her brother cremates her after having tried everything to save his little sister. The most depressing thing with this movie is: you feel so helpless. You think: Man, I wish I could have helped those kids.This movie has changed my whole attitude to life. All the problems you may have - they become so small. Watch it and you´ll be a different person.Michael Saunders"
"Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation, but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant, and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes, including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful, and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters, the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one, but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched, let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant, with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see."
"One of the great animated films of all time Grave of Fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time Japan. What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.Like its companion piece, Barefoot Gen, which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right, this film proves that war is hell for everyone, especially the children.Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.9 out of 10"
"This is one of those reviews where I will say at the outset that, if you haven't yet seen the film, you should go see it. As soon as (or even before, if you're the impatient type) you read this review, I urge you to run out and buy or rent it.Because my words simply cannot convey what Isao Takahata's animated masterpiece Hotaru no haka conveys.Known in the English-speaking world as Grave of the Fireflies or, in some countries, Tombstone for Fireflies, Hotaru no haka is the single most powerful anti-war film I have ever seen. As a work of art, it ranks among Picasso's Guernica and Elgar's cello concerto. It succeeds where many American filmslike Fahrenheit 9/11, Apocalypse Now, and even Schindler's Listsimply don't. Hotaru no haka is a grim depiction of innocence lost, not just of its two young protagonists, but of the entire Japanese nation.The story centers around two children: Seita, who is about thirteen; and his younger sister Setsuko, who is four. Their mother dies of wounds when their town is attacked during the firebombing of Japan in World War II, and they go to live with an aunt. While kind at first, she grows to resent the two siblings she must now feed and shelterwhy can't Seita ""work for the war effort,"" as his cousin and uncle are doing? Seita and Setsuko eventually set out on their own to live in an abandoned shelter. But food is hard to come by, and they gradually succumb to malnutrition.Yes, they die. That is obvious from the film's exposition, which shows Seita sitting ragged and obviously malnourished in a train station, a mysterious tin on his person. A janitor throws the tin into the night, where fireflies encircle it and the spirit of Setsuko emerges. She joins her brother's ghost, they board a train to the next world, and the story is told in flashback. ""September 21, 1945... that was the night I died"" is the opening line.The interesting thing about this film is that, although it is Japanese, it neither victimizes the Japanese nor demonizes the Americans. In fact, its deepest disdain is reserved perhaps for the Japanese people themselves, who turn a cold shoulder to the suffering of their children and fellow citizens. Takahata shows us that the true casualty of war is not life, but innocence.The animation, while in the stylized animé tradition, is rooted in realism and rich detail; and, while it strikingly depicts the tragic demise of the characters, it also has many moments of beauty. There is much to be admired visually in this filmhardly surprising, since it comes from Japan's legendary Studio Ghibli, which has produced the most breathtaking traditional animation that I have ever had the privilege to see.All these elementsstory, symbolism, animationcombine to make one big emotional punch in the gut that is hard to recover from and impossible to forget. It's an animated film, sure; but it is one of the most bitingly real films you'll ever see, and the simple fact that it is not live-action doesn't diminish its power. If you have a night to ruin, watch Hotaru no haka. It's a film that you don't want to see, but one that you will never regret having seen.My inevitable ""dub vs. sub"" commentary: The DVD contains two versions of the film: one is a dubbed English version, and the other is the original Japanese with English subtitles. I urge you to do yourself a favor, and watch the Japanese version. I see no point in watching the dub, since you won't be showing Hotaru no haka to younger children anyways....right?"
"Truly one of Studio Ghibli's greatest crowning achievements, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is a brilliant masterpiece fully deserving of a place in any of the best movies ever made. Not just an astonishingly great (and, at the risk of coming off as cliché, perfect) work of art, this is a moving, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.Based on an autobiography by Akiyuki Nosaka, the film, set during the bombing of Japan in --of all times-- World War II, centers on Seita, a loving, headstrong Navy soldier's son and his innocent little sister, Setsuko. Their fatal struggle for survival begins right at the start, when both are bombed out of house and home by American B-29s. Mom is seriously wounded and found wrapped in bandages at a hospital, where she dies shortly after. The children move to Nishinomiya to stay with their aunt. Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out. After butting heads with Auntie long enough, the children decide to run away, setting up home in an abandoned cave by the lake. Both try by all means to live off of vegetables or whatever food they can afford to trade and/or steal, to no avail....The outcome of the story is actually showcased at the opening of the movie, where we see a ghostly specter of Seita watching a more malnourished version of himself die a painful, lonely death at a train station. Indeed, as we see how these events came to pass, we find ourselves rooting for Seita and Setsuko to find a way to stay alive, but alas, it is not to be, given Seita's stubborn pride. The overall tone of the movie is of a very tragic nature--even such lighthearted moments as the aforementioned sequences involving Seita and Setsuko playing around the house or gathering fireflies as lights for their cave are all tainted with a touch of sadness, for we know that these brief scenes of happiness will not last.Who is to blame for the plight of these children? The movie never addresses this question to the audience, nor does it really care to. It would be easy for director Isao Takahata to make this an anti-American movie, but he does better than that. Instead, he aptly conveys that war can spell serious--and deadly--consequences for victims. He also eschews casting any character as a hero or villain, and instead makes this a very human story, with no clear-cut ""good"" or ""bad"" characters. The aunt, for example, is not evil; she is merely an angry, desperate woman who is only struggling to survive just as much as Seita and Setsuko are. Atrocious as her treatment of the children is, we somehow never see her as a true baddie, but a very flawed, multi-faceted human being.Normally one would think of this kind of story as suitable for live-action, but GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES proves that it can be told through the art of animation as well. This is no mindless showcase of gorgeous visuals--although the artistic merits of the movie are, as with Ghibli productions, sumptuous and at times breathtaking--but a display of real characters struggling with very tangible emotions. And the most amazing accomplishment about this movie is how much we grow to care for Seita and Setsuko--their inseparable bond of love and companionship is the heart and soul behind the movie.There are long stretches of silence on the soundtrack, with music used very sparingly, yet the movie is all the more powerful for it. The most effective moment is where we hear a scratchy rendition of ""Home, Sweet Home"" over a montage of Setsuko playing by the shelter. It's a simplistic, sweet, yet very saddening moment that not only works in the context of the movie, but on its own as well.I don't normally say this in my reviews, but I would definitely recommend watching this movie in its native language of Japanese for a truly powerful and memorable experience. That's not to imply, however, that the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media, is inferior; on the contrary. It is, in fact, surprisingly good, with an effective lead in J. Robert Spencer and noteworthy cameo appearances by Anime voice-over actors Veronica Taylor, Crispin Freeman, and Dan Green. Rhoda Chrosite's Setsuko is the one voice that doesn't fare so well; she sounds more like an adult pretending to be a young girl, and comes across as strained during most scenes (save for when she is sick from diarrhea). Still, for those who can't read subtitles, the dub is more than adequate (although not as high-profile as others that I've heard).Even in a genre as multi-faceted as Japanese Anime, there are few films that literally everyone really MUST see. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is one such movie."
"""English is not my native language so apologies for any mistakes""As the title say, this is the saddest movie I have ever seen. I was crying for days after I watch this, by just seeing a picture of setsuko on my phone. This movie was a life changer for me, it made me see things much different in the world...The movie is a masterpiece. The characters, Seita and Setsuko are so well made that at the end you feel like are your own children! This movie should be taught as a lesson to schools, to create an anti-war character to children.I read many reviews and youtube videos and all people feel the same... they all cried a lot. Our cries are for the millions of Seita and setsuko in the world :(. Lets all do what we can, so there will be less and less children suffering from stupid wars!"
"Let me put it this way. When I was five, I would wake up early every morning to watch my favorite cartoons. One night, I woke up way early than usual. It must have been around three o' clock. Anyway, I did what I usually did. I watched television. Nothing was on, so I switched it to channel 8 and laid down. There would always be weird interesting stuff on that channel that I used to love watching. A few minutes had passed with me watching whatever was on this channel ans eventually, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES came on. At that time, I had never seen a serious animated film. The film started and there were two ghosts. I remember seeing how peaceful the whole thing seemed and feeling that it was strange that it wasn't a scary type of film. However, I probably shouldn't have assumed that it wasn't a scary film at that point. Soon after, there were terrifying scenes of destruction and chaos with people getting shot and butchered. A boy and his baby sister were caught up in it all and were desperately trying to get away. I saw these two siblings and the love and care that he had for his younger sister and immediately broke into tears. At that time, I had never seen a film where people cared about each other in such an honest and unflinching way. It was shocking to me in a way that I had seen a film that displayed so much love and desperation. The film continued and their trials became more and more horrific. By the end of the film, I could barely breathe. The film had hit me so hard in my heart that I felt wounded. I have never feared and loved a film both at the same time as much as I had for GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES. When the film was over, I fell asleep crying. When I awoke, I wondered if what I had watched was a dream. Could such a film ever even exist? I had been afraid to find out, but inside I yearned to learn more about it. Fast forward thirteen years later and I know more about it than I had when I was younger. I haven't seen it since, but I remember it as clearly as possible. I remember the music, the images, the emotion, the love, etc... I can never forget this film. Will I ever decide to pick it up and view it a second time? Absolutely. I just need to make sure that I know what I will get into if I watch it again. It's a touching piece of work and one that will go down in history as one of the most emotional and beautiful films ever made."
"I first saw this film when I first really got into anime in High School. I'd grow up with Naussica and cartoons, and had just seen Akira, then my brother and I rented this.We sat through the whole thing without saying a word, then when the movie was over we didn't even talk.Not a simple film. Instead of just making the Americans out to be bad guys, the Japanese people in the children's village either through greed (their aunt) or through indifference (Gardener, Doctor), also play their part in the children's starvation and death. So it's not just about war, or anti-war, though I can't think a better movie to watch about war.The animation is perfect also. Absolutely beautiful colors.As another testament to the power of this movie, I decided to sponser a child through Compassion after watching it for the second time, 8 years later.Everyone should see this one, but be warned, it's not Akira or even a Miyazaki movie. Watch it with an open mind and heart."
"Now I'm usually your typical Die-Hard, Guns Blazing, Sword Swinging, Magic Wielding Anime fan! So there shouldn't really be any surprises when I say that ""Grave of the Fire Flies"" is not ranked among my list of all time favourites. And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed) That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison. I don't think I've ever been more moved by any other films, period!!! I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing. In any case I don't think I need to re-watch it as it's been burned into my memory forever.This is a film that I hate and love at the same time. The beautiful story and the capturing of facial expressions which only a hand drawn animation could fully realise. On the other hand the film reduced me to sobbing wreck, a bitter sweet ending which left me so depressed it took me another two days to get over...Its a must see, but be sure to have lots of tissue paper on hand. I'm temped to say it's a life changing experience, certainly has been for me. The rest I leave to you to decide."
"this movie really gives you another view of a war. I'm no fan of manga or older movies, but this one really got me.Seita really does everything to let his little sister live. but in hard times it isn't that easy. Seita and his little sisters village gets nuked during WW2 and they escape to their aunt. but their mom is badly hurt and will not survive. thats the first spot where you really feel the movie.their aunt don't take that well care of them as they want so they move out and lives in a cage, but they cant find enough food so Setsuko gets sick so Seita takes her to the doctor, but he wont help her, so now it's just a question about time. in the end of the movie Setsuko dies, and if you haven't cried once in the movie, you will now.when the flashbacks on Setsuko comes, you will be crushed. you don't want to see this movie anymore.This is a lovely movie you NEVER want to see again!"
"This is my first review on IMDb.Japanese animation is something that has always been seen as a different expanse from the animation that we get here in America. Not to say that those films are bad, but the things that we see from oversees in this area are getting to be quite impressive. One studio in particular, the Japanese Disney, if you will, Studio Ghibli. Best known as the creative force behind Spirited Away and other Miyazaki films, we forget to see some of the other films that have come from the minds that reside there in. I am talking of Isao Takahata, always by Miyazaki's side, but never really given the credit he deserves. Without this man, there wouldn't be a Studio Ghibli. He is a key character in the development of any and all films to come from the studio, and most likely created the best feature to come forth.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is, quite possibly, the best animated feature of our time. When a film is done without a camera, when acting is without seeing your actors, and when cinematography is but a pencil line, you have to think about how to rate such a movie. Well, this is the standard on which all animation should be based. The movie is subtle in everything it conveys, but subtle in a way where it can't be ignored. You feel for these characters represented on that screen, and it makes you forget that you aren't watching something ""animated"". The truly beautiful thing about this movie is that as you watch the film, you want to see good things happen to these kids...Yet, as the movie opens, you see the main character, a boy named Seita, die right before your eyes. Immediate and profound. The film opens, and then you have a narration heard over head, that goes like this...""In 1945, on the night of September 21, I died."" You hear this almost omniscient voice as the visual shows a boy, tattered and bone thin, propped against a pillar in a train station. Then, as the narrative comes to a close, the boy slouches over, and says in a final breath, ""Setsuko"". Not in anyway is this ""cartoony"" either, his eyes remain open, his mouth agape, and you can just sense that this is the main character of our story. Our ""hero"" is destined to die, and you have to watch the movie show it as it enfolds. A young child will die, and there is no stopping that from coming, no matter how attached you get to that boy. He will die. How harrowing is that? It gets worse when you see the corpse being riddled of its possessions by a security guard. Welcome to the movie. Like many films, though this has a ""G"" rating, you have to see where I stand on that. Already this movie is too much for a child to handle or grasp, and that rating will be misinterpreted as something of a children's movie. Though, being animated, it already has that covered. It's sad, in my opinion, that such a good film as this will remain lost to so many because of simple thinking like that.The movie has you know that all hope you will gain for these characters is futile, that life is never that easy. To keep you realizing this, they have the spirits, or Rei, of Seita and Setsuko (his younger sister) watching on as the events unfold. They appear at times throughout the film where the emotions are high, to keep you in this mold of reality. That means the whole movie is one big flashback, in a sense, but that really doesn't matter. It's the story of two children, lost in the slew of war. People are harsh, and war is unfair. Yoou can't choose who is effected by war, because everyone is, and these are the things that this movie causes you to realize. Other movies involving war have shown this, but it is from the eyes of a child that this gains it's impact. They never lose their innocence, and that is what makes this story so compelling. They are just kids. I'm not going to ruin the events of the story for you all, I wouldn't want to tarnish the way you view this film in the least. I will, however, like to sincerely recommend that you find this film, and that you watch it, with no stereotypes of animation. You haven't seen something like this, trust me. It belongs on the list of great war movies, but also on one of the greatest stories ever told. Compelling through and through, I have bought three versions of the movie. Subtitled is best, as it shows not only the original intent, but the true nature of the films culture. This movie remains one of the focal points in the argument of ""anime"" being much more than animated movies from Japan. They can be like any other film, and at times they can beat out most other films,and this is the example to prove it. A beautiful movie, and one that should be seen by anyone who respects movies."
"I was a geeky teenager in the 90's who loved anime. The thing I liked about anime was that even though I was getting too old to watch cartoons, I could make the claim that in Japan cartoons were made for grown-ups and justify my love for them. I would go to Tower Records and rent every single anime as they came out and then copy them with two VCR's (90's version of torrenting) and this was released by Central Park Media (one of the three American companies releasing anime back then) so like all the others I rented and copied it. But oh my God this blew all the other stuff I was watching out of the water. IT made me cry, it made me feel. I HAD to show my parents this film to justify my love of anime.And I did, and my parents who really don't like cartoons both cried. Bawled. My dad says he still remembers it and that it haunted him. Anyways, fast forward to the present day, I am now an adult approaching my 40's, i have a family of my own, I've outgrown anime (let's be honest the majority of it is garbage) but my dad reminded me about this film, so I decided to watch it again all these years later to see if it would still hold up.I cried even more. Once you become a parent, as many other reviewers have said here, you put your loved ones faces on the animated characters and it makes it even more powerful. I don't know if this could have been even more powerful or more heart-wrenching if it was live action. You can watch it and because it's animated you can project onto the animated characters and setting even easier than if it was live-action. You can see war torn Kobe as your hometown, you can see it as Iraq, you can see it as Afghanistan, it makes the film all the more powerful. Being a dad now I watch a lot of cartoons, and all the Disney ones, and Pixar etc with my own little Setsuko...this film blows them all out of the water. This is indeed, the greatest animated film of all time if for nothing else than the fact that it is able to transcend the genre and shows the full unfiltered power of what the media is capable of showing. If you are a parent, or have little ones in your life this film will hit you harder, but even as a teenager it hit me hard. I think it shaped my views on war, and had a very profound affect on me. I don't understand the people who say they wouldn't watch this again because there is something strangely cathartic and beautiful about being able to bawl your eyes out. I guess people are afraid of their own vulnerability but I have to say, I enjoyed getting back in touch with that empathetic part of myself. It's strangely relaxing. Highly recommended."
"I'll start out by saying that I've seen over one thousand movies and only a few of them brought me close to tears, but I've never cried before. This is the first movie that made me cry and I've cried during the movie and I've cried well after the movie was over. I finally stopped crying and decided to write this review (my first movie review) and typing these words thinking about the movie brought tears into my eyes again. I'm a pretty tough guy and I rarely get emotional, but boy did this movie hit me hard.I think everybody should see this movie, even though it's such a heart wrenching emotional experience. It will definitely touch you and you'll have a different outlook on life after seeing this movie."
"I was not so much surprised as I was elated at having an Anime movie move me so much. The attention to detail was exceptional. The expressions and readability of the characters' faces was impressive. This is a movie that helps you find truth and life. It is not a religious movie directly; however, there is great spiritual stirring in it. I was not moved to tears, rather, more like people experiencing this type of horrifying event, I was stunned. I cried later. This is one of the best of hundreds of movies I have seen in my 42 years. I will never forget it."
"Tears swell up in my eyes just thinking about this movie. To simply give it a rating or praise would not do it justice. Keeping that in mind, this is still the best movie I have ever seen. It has changed my life. After watching this movie, I keep asking myself why do we kill each other? What drives this putrid hatred in us that pushes us to war? Can't we see that no one wins in war...no one wins anything. We only lose loved ones and cause unbearable pain and suffering on each other and for what? Our country? This mass of inanimate land? Or perhaps some perverse idea of honor and pride? What honor is there in killing Seita and Setsuko?I can't say anymore about this movie... You simply must watch it to feel its awesome power."
"i just finished the movie and if not for my 2 dogs I would have to drive to someones house at 2am because I could not be alone right now. I dare not give anything away but I will say that the movie really got to me. I consider myself very educated and informed about the most troubling issues facing the planet I live on, but this movie really shook me up. I had to hold back tears with all my might because I was scared to let go, I was afraid because the movie, a cartoon, became so real I forgot I was watching a movie, I was completely lost in the story and it was scary. A cartoon should not be able to do that. Please watch the movie and remember it is a true story."
"Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving, sincere, haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic, but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer, but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy, and because you know the outcome at the beginning, this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone, the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.Staying simple and focused, kept it rather flawless in its in-depth story telling of emotional pride and lasting effects. Slow it might be, but there's too much subtle richness within its characters, premise and visuals to really bother about the loose pacing and lack of action. Isao Takahata adapts the novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, and gets us deeply involved with the civilians, and the mere war stays in the background. A contrast between two different worlds, one being the war itself and secondly the one the two children find themselves in to forget it. Namely those scenes where they're experiencing the beauty and freeness of nature (at if they might never get that chance again) and those sequences with the fireflies admirably paint the feelings of what's to come. The budding relationship between Seita and Setsuko is tremendously done, innocent and full of colour. Even capturing the Japanese citizens and families in this cold plight is believability achieved, as it throws questions, issues and metaphorical messages. These people (including our two central characters) are doing it hard, but their wills won't collapse after what they've been through, but things do take their toll when everything you ever care for can suddenly vanish and the heartache turns to utter numbness. Because what kept you living, is no longer there to hold you.Breathing heavily on the mood is the soft, lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone. The vivid animation is gorgeously crisp and enchanting, and the background scenery is profoundly vivid and convincing. Many beautiful, striking illustrations are framed with a sincere touch, where darkness treads neatly together with the lighter moments. What a delightfully effective and soulful meditation piece of sublime art by director/writer Isao Takahata. This one has plenty to say on the topic at hand, and it gets even more relevant everyday.Magnificently heart-wrenching and sensitive war-time story on the people who find themselves dealing with the unbearable consequences of war."
"I cried watching this film, something I haven't done in years.  It's been two days since I saw it and I still can't get it out of my head.  My wife and I have talked much more about this film than most others and I have spent some time researching the film online.  Never has a film hit me on such a personal level.  I am the father of two small children and after seeing this film I went into their rooms while they slept and kissed them and whispered that I love them.Having done some research on the author and the truth behind the story I realize it has lots of symbolism and literary and cultural references which I as a Westerner cannot understand, so I'll keep my comments on the personal level.  The film gets its message across that in war, it is the most vulnerable of society who suffer the most. It troubled me because as an American I don't see the daily struggle for existence in regions torn by war and hunger(Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Balkans, and possibly Iraq to name a few of many conflicts).  It also troubled me that my country really doesn't care either.  As a father of a 5 year old son and a 2 year old daughter, I want the suffering of Seita and Setsuko to stop and someone to acknowledge and help their emotional pain as well as their hunger.  As a parent, I dread the thought of my children being without anyone or being in their situation. As a kid I read lots of WWII books and knew that we had firebombed several Japanese cities and that Navy fighters were strafing small towns.  This film made all that history seem very real and present. As an evangelical Christian, it also reinforces for me how cruel and how kind people can be and how lost we truly are.I read Roger Ebert's review of this film and I agree with him that it is one of the best I have ever seen, because it troubled me deeply on a personal and external level.  I can't look at my daughter now and not think of Setsuko and her beauty, sadness, and innocence.  See it, but don't see it alone.  Remember it's not for children since it's more than a cartoon."
"God .... the movie is great but damn why did I watch this ? Its way too sad for me.
It's a great piece of art but , be warned, bring tissues if you are going to watch it, cuz there is a 99% of probability that you'll cry, and a lot."
"For the first time, I have decided to write a comment. You have seen enough reviews and ratings (and rantings). I prefer to address the commmon ways in which this movie has been misinterpreted.Many reviewers, both American and others, seem to have mistaken this movie for either a tear jerker or a political statement. In essence, it is neither. The novel it is based on is simply an expression of the guilt and pain felt by the author.To those who feel that it is a politically motivated story, or it only portrays suffering on part of the Japanese: Quite simply...it is not. The war scenes are not there for drama, they are there to place the situation into context. It is my opinion that your personal prejudices are coming into play. Being a patriotic American, I can state (not without shame) that there are plenty of mindless American movies which portray Americans as either heroes or victims (usually both) and their purpose (as with all flicks) is $. It is my sincere opinion that Akiyuki Nosaka's motives were far purer when he wrote this. He was looking for closure and writing a tribute to his sister at the same time.To those who feel revulsion towards Seita and feel that the war scenes were pointless: As mentioned earlier, all the the war scenes do is place the story in context. They are not there to excuse Seita's actions in any way. The story clearly shows that there is no absolution for Seita (Akiyuki Nosaka's alter-ego). He bares his shortcomings and imperfections (as seen from his own eyes) for the world to see and feel repulsed by in the hope to find some solace for his own guilty heart. I've dragged this on far too long and I have a test tomorrow morning.Cheers!"
"This is my first review for any movie and the feeling is paradoxical...on one hand I feel impelled to write this review and on the other I also feel that my review will be inconsequential considering the greatness of the work..To start, this is not merely another movie...it's much more than what we know as Cinema. It shows you the mirror...not just any ordinary mirror..one in which you see your soul. This work truly penetrates the material being and reaches your soul where the epiphany of being a human occurs. Being a human means the one who feels, the one who has emotions...In today's stressful life we often feel that we are emotionally invulnerable..In fact to succeed in your life today..you need to forget that you feel and act like a machine. This movie wakes you up. I can say that because there is no one person who would not cry watching it. It's not a shame. It's not a weakness. It makes even adults cry because it hits your soul of whose existence even you might be unaware of before.To consider it a movie will be doing injustice to the effect it generates. It's a soul-stirring work which we usually tend to associate with archaic literature. As a piece of Art, it is one of the best tragedies ever written...not only on the silver screen but in the entire human history. If you think I am exaggerating, you have to see this movie and it will have the same effect on you as Romeo-Juliet or Hamlet or Macbeth will have or maybe more since it's presented through the modern and hence, more understandable modes of communication.In my opinion the top rated movies and so the greatest movies are about gangsters, murders, bad guys. No disrespect to them, I am a movie buff and those are my favorites (The shawshank redemption#1, godfathers#2,3,and others like pulp fiction, goodfellas,the good,bad, ugly), but honestly, ask yourself..how many gangsters you know...or superheroes for that matter. Those are great works but they are fiction in the truest sense. you cannot relate to them. Those are fantasies. While 'Grave of the Fireflies' lets you relate yourself to the protagonist through the HUMAN connection.I have seen most of the top rated movies and without being a braggart,can safely claim to have developed a taste and an eye for great works and to me this is the greatest work of cinema. Astonishingly simple but powerful like an A-bomb(ironically) which devastates all your beliefs and ideals about War, Human Relations and Life in general."
"I am crying right now while writing this comment. It's my birthday, and I wanted to seen a movie that was a definite masterpiece, and I found this one. Never wanted to cry on my birthday, but couldn't help it. A tale of a brother and his kid sister in WW2 Japan, which actually tells you the suffering of a common man had a family, a life, a smile and a future, but lost everything for no fault of his own. It's so touching that you cannot help breaking down to tears. I won't reveal the plot here, but I'll suggest you watch the Japanese version with English subs. This is surely the one which will move you to the core, it felt like I lost something too, when the movie ended, and 'she never woke up'. Great stuff - 10/10 (or even 11/10 - as an anime moved me more than a human film)"
Some movies are always made to make you shed a tear or two but BEWARE this might just bring about a tsunami in your house.It is a Japanese movie made in 1988 so I caught the English dubbed version.There is an anti-war social message and can be easily compared to great war films like 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.The dubbing artists have lent their voices perfectly to the lead pairs in the English dubbed version and retain the same emotions as in the Japanese version.It is definitely going to emotionally stir you and undoubtedly can be called as one of the greatest movies ever made.It's a crime to miss this outstanding piece of cinema.
"Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no Haka) is one of the most powerful and beautifully made movies based on WWII.It is not about the leaders or military, but about the people themselves. Two orphans Seita and Setsuko lost their home to the air bombs, where thrown out of the house of their angry Aunt and forced to live on their own in the bomb shelters.Some people have complained that this movie is pro-Tojo and anti-American, but it's not. It is just simply a point of view from the common folk of that country, and everyone of every country, whether in War or Peace, have a story to tell.Did you know that this movie is based off of the semi-true story of Akiyuki Nosaka, who also lost his sister to starvation. Feeling guilty of all this, he writes this story, with Seita's death symbolizing the slow mental dying in the poor man's mind.It is a powerful movie, I recommend this movie for everyone to see. It has a well meaning message of the hardships of WWII."
War brings only ruin and misery both for the heroes and the villains.Its easily overlooked in western media how Japam was devastated during the final days of the war.A whole country became the sacrificial lamb the Usa needed to showcase their dominance through the globe.And children are always the first victims
"This is quite possibly the saddest movie ever made. It is, however, worth seeing once, particularly if you were not involved in your sister's death. I will never watch it again, but I'll set it up for you to run if you stop by some time. It is about a young brother and sister who are made homeless by allied bombing of Japan in WWII. They are taken in by a relative but with times being hard they leave there to strike out for themselves and for a while they get along all right until things get really bad and they get really hungry. At that time, when there is nothing left to do but steal things turn worse and worse.The film pulls no punches about the trials of the children. It's rough."
"Seriously. I just...I can't even with you. Oh sure, you're absolutely perfect in every possible way, but still...I can't. I honestly wish I'd never watched you and your beautiful, difficult sadness. Ugh. Where's my daughter? I need to hold her. Forever....sigh. Seriously...eff you."
"Grave of the fireflies is truly one of the most touching films that i have ever seen and it is such a beautiful movie that shows the relationship between a brother and his younger sister trying to survive in a war-torn Japan during WW2. The story revolves around Seita and his younger sister Setsuko, as we see them trying to survive.
If this film proves anything it is that animation is no just suited to tell kids tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy. Japanse animation or ""anime"" is a style and sometimes you have to look past the style of a movie to appreciate a beautiful and heartbreaking story. 
But what this movie really excels at is showing the results of war and also the victims of war as we see our two main characters Seita and Setsuko dealing with the situation there in.
Grave of the fireflies is one of my favourite films of all time and it brings me to tears every time i watch it."
"I will start by saying that at the time of writing this review, I am 18 years old. I had never cried whilst watching a movie. I was borderline teary watching the Australian film ""Red Dog"", and absolutely crying on the inside during ""Magnolia"" and ""Requiem for a Dream""; but never had a film completely moved me to emotionally produce tears. Until I watched Isao Takahata's ""Grave of the Fireflies"". Never has a film conveyed so much sorrow, tragedy and depression using the form of animation. It's deeply emotional on one hand, but undoubtedly beautiful on the other. Call it flawed, call it manipulative, call it whatever you want; but I do feel that if you express a great deal of negativity towards this film, then you have completely missed the rewarding experience.The film is set during the World War II period and centres on the story of a boy named Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi) and his much younger sister Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi). Setsuko is naïve and fragile, and Seita's primary focus is on keeping the two of them alive during this time of tragedy. They want to be happy, but during a time like this, it's near on impossible to do so. He is 14, she is 4. The sense of hopelessness is drawn up early on. The opening sequence shows our young hero dying of starvation in a train station. The rest of the world moves along as he and others lay against poles waiting for the death to reach them. It's a devastating sight. No this is not the teary part. Watch the film as it cuts back to the beginning of their story. to see the power that will come over you and have you reaching for the tissues.Michio Mamiya's score is enough to convey the harrowing atmosphere. It elevates at times, matched with light-scaled animation, but will drop faster than a bomb into the deep pits of despair as we follow these two children on their quest to stay alive. Prepare to be shaken. The children are moved around, never wholly welcome anywhere, Seita is caught stealing to survive, hope is seemingly out-of-reach. But do not be put off by what I've said. No one who is interested in the power of cinema should dare miss it. It's a Masterpiece. One of the greatest war films and animated films ever made. Period."
"Most of the famous war films ever made, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Cross of Iron"", usually try to show the film and the war from the point of view of soldiers, those who fought in there. It is rare to see a film from the point of view of the innocent victims of the war. Probably the most famous film of victims is Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Even rarer is an animated film of victims of war. Animations in western countries are usually labeled as children's stuff, so it is no wonder Disney has refused to distribute this film, one of the Studio Ghibli's greatest works.""September 21, 1945 that was the night I died""With those words starts director Isao Takahata's most famous film, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" (Hotaru no haka, 1988). Unlike his long time friend and colleague Hayao Miyazaki, Takahata prefers to leave fantasy elements in his films to minimum. This is the way how Takahata amazes viewers. If Miyazaki's fantastic visions make our jaws drop to floor with amazement, Takahata's close to reality stories touch us deeply by hitting our emotions. And ""Grave of the Fireflies"" certainly does that masterly, being the only film that has ever managed to move me to the point of tears (and I am *not* a teary guy).The film, based on a novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, tells the story of a young boy named Seita, who with his little sister Setsuko, lives in the 1940's Japan, during the World War II. After loosing their mother during a bombing, Seita does everything in his power to create an illusion for Setsuko that things are fine and there is nothing to worry about. The film has been often blamed of being too depressing and having a sad end, but I think it's the opposite. Of course this certainly is not the kind of film to make you smile, but it is already revealed in the beginning that both brother and sister will die. So when we reach the end of the movie, with an image of them as spirits, sitting on a bench looking happy and healthy, with a modern day city around them, this is actually a happy ending after all the suffering they went through.It's very hard to say exactly why this film should deserve full stars from me. It just does. It's full of little beautiful scenes that instantly have an effect on you, accompanied by Michio Mamiya's peaceful music. Maybe the fact that it can make me wonder why it is so good is the proof enough to make it a masterpiece. And that is what ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is; a masterpiece. One of the most amazing films from Studio Ghibli and Isao Takahata's most famous film. And definitely the ultimate proof that animations can be used for other than children's stories."
"The way that this movie involves you is completely unbelievable.What impressed me the most was the way that the movie started. Not at first. As i saw the beginning i was really absent of any emotion, just another bum. I guess i'm a product of society and really don't see the story behind that person. As i saw the movie it moved me, i loved the characters and the way the story was told. A sad story, but told in a positive way.I didn't cried during the movie, i loved how the author didn't exaggerated on the little girl's death.The problem was when after finishing seeing the movie i went back and saw the first minutes, and then... oh boy did i cried. Not just another bum now..I guess the humanity that the movie transmits and the way that it does so, is incredible."
"In a time when Disney and Pixar milk false sentiment for all its worth, here is a film which delivers not sentimentality, but truth. The characterisation of the little girl is charming: cute but intensely realistic. The film grips with its depiction of the aftermath of a fire bombing and has a political sub-theme but it is the little girl who is our real concern. We laugh with her, fear for her - and ultimately despair with her. The ending is gut-wrenching - one of the most moving endings my family has ever seen ..... my 20 year old son had to leave the room! If you watch only one film about war, watch this.Whilst the art work is deceptively simple it easily surpasses modern animation and clearly paved the way for films like 'Spirited Away'. Unlike most Japanese films the narrative is easy to follow and (rare in Japanese animation) never strays into fantasy or surrealism. The countryside is beautiful and is clearly intended to be seen in juxtaposition to the depiction of the damage war does. Part of that damage is also human: we see people degenerate and become selfish, desperate and de-sensitised but the little girl remains somehow spiritually untarnished ..... but not physically so."
"One only has to look at the rest of these comments to see that this movie really affected people. It affected me as well. I've never cried so much during and after a movie so much in my life.Roger Ebert and another famous critic (I forget his name) compared this movie to Schindler's List. That's an apt comparison. This movie is so human. So very human. It will make you want to hug all of your loved ones just to make sure they are safe and happy.That this movie is animated doesn't hurt it a bit. In fact, it makes it better. Instead of connecting the characters that are so well-developed in the movie with an actor, you only connect them with the idea of a person you've created in your head. It's like reading a book. Without explicit visual cues to go by, one has to create the images in one's head. It makes the characters that much more powerful and moving because instead of being on a screen, they are in your head. That said, I could not get them out of my head for days. Especially the little girl. I love her!"
"There is no denying that Studio Ghibli is the finest animation company ever and have made some of the most stunning pieces of cinema ever. The fact that they never fail to craft some of the most beautiful and compelling masterpieces proves the brilliance. Ghibli animators make films that are intelligent, fulfilling, complex and burst with joy. The animation is one that can appeal to people of all walks of life and perfectly sums up what cinema is all about. I've never once been disappointed by a Studio Ghibli work.Grave Of The Fireflies is certainly far from easy viewing and is one of the most harrowing war films ever made. When released in America Grave Of The Fireflies caused controversy because some people felt it was anti-American and the fact is that it's not. The film doesn't take sides to anyone and understands that everybody did awful and horrific things during WW2. One thing that is obvious when watching the film is the fact it's anti-war and shows how the innocent are the people who become the most effected.It's not easy to make films about subjects like this one because they become very emotional and hard to make realistic. Yet Grave Of The Fireflies succeeds in every way other war films don't. The story is a magnificent tale of love and friendship between an older brother and his young sister. The loss of innocence and the real-life brutality that these children see are something that nobody would ever want or be prepared for.The cinematography is beautiful and every frame of animation holds so much substance and inner beauty. There are very few films that manage to play with my emotions as easily as Grave Of The Fireflies because it remains a haunting study of a brother and sister's friendship. I found it hard not to cry and I'll be honest I did cry towards the end of the film. The fact that you fall in love with the characters and become attached to their personality, surroundings and situations is why it remains so provocative. The film's style is excellent and helps set a perfect mood. I love the use of operatic music at the end of the film as it was profoundly effecting.A genuine masterpiece of cinema, one of the greatest animations (anime), one of the greatest war films and one of the greatest films ever made. Recommended for anyone of any age, a film with mass appeal and wide range. Holds a wonderful message and a genuinely inspiring story. Sheer brilliance for what is such a daring piece of film-making."
"extremely heartbreaking story of a boy about 14 years old who has to take care of his sister during world war 2. It is possibly one of the saddest movies you will ever watch and at the same time its heartwarming in a way. It really puts the life at the in japan at the time into perspective considering it is in the most part a true story. You really must see this movie, if you think things are bad for you it really makes you think twice about it. Its a studio Ghibli production so you know its going to be an amazing movie, nothing else needs to be said to make you watch this movie, but you really should. Girls show it to you're boyfriends and see if they have a heart or not, ha ha. Not really, i watched it alone, I'm a guy and I hate tearing up in front of others. But this wouldn't be a bad one to see with a girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife..... but i wouldn't consider it all that great for friends to watch together."
"This movie is the most beautiful movie I had ever seen. No other movie touched me like this one did. For all you people who think all animation is kids stuff, you're wrong. Grave of the Fireflies is NOT for kids. I don't even know why the cover states it is rated 3 and up. It should be rated pg13 because it is much to sad for little kids. I watched Grave of the Fireflies about a year ago. My brother saw it on the internet, and after I did. I thought it was going to be violent, but that wasn't the case. It was beautiful and tear jerking. Before I saw Grave of the Fireflies I always thought A Walk to Remember or Titanic was the saddest movie. These movies are NOTHING compared to Grave of the Fireflies. Setsuko was so real. I have never seen any four year old in movies act like a real four year old like her. It brought me to tears to see her die. But then again, Grave of the Fireflies is also sort of happy. At the beginning and the end you see that both Seita and Setsuko are together again, and there is no more suffering. Grave of the Fireflies shows what a war could do to people. Do we really think about what happens to the children and their families during a war?Thank you Isao Takahata for producing such a masterpiece! Grave of the Fireflies is a must see."
"It's better not to learn too much about this film before watching it, for fear of spoiling it. I'd heard it described as the saddest film of all time, but even that didn't prepare me for what I saw.Speaking from the point of view of somebody who avoids animation as much as possible, I found this to be a piece of exceptional film-making. Use as many superlatives as you like: amazing, engrossing, compelling, outstanding, it all boils down to one important thing - this film tells a story that grips us with its exploration of the human condition. I imagine virtually everybody who watches it will be able to identify with it in some way or other.So forget this one's a cartoon and just go into it expecting a tale packed with emotion and feeling. And if you have to go back and watch the beginning again after you've seen it all the way through, that's fine too."
"What an amazing film! Very rarely have I been moved this much by an animated film. Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and ""depressing"" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Graveyard for fireflies is a heart rendering animated tale from japan that is based on the events of world war II invasion of japan by America. The movie highlights the evils of war and shows in detail the way lives of normal people get affected by political motives of power hungry leaders. The story revolves around a boy and his young sister. Following the invasion by America, their happy lives are overturned and are left to face the hardships they had never expected. The beautiful thing to see, however, is their will to fight to adjust to deteriorating situations around them. As the story goes on, their resilience is finally overtaken by acute shortage of basic supplies. The hardest part of the movie to watch is how it leaves the brother helpless. The boy shows exceptional courage for his age, and does his best, even goes out of the way at times, just to help keep his little sister happy and comfortable. Being a navy officer's son, he is filled with dignity and tries to keep it till the end. However, some viewers may find his dignity throwing few shades of ego in certain crucial moments of the film that they might feel, could have changed their situation, had he compromised. Although the brother has a strong presence in the story, i t is the sister that wins hearts by her cuteness. The simple words, and child behaviour, is excellently depicted in her character. There are things she says during the movie that will leave you filled with emotions - warmth, joy, sadness.. you get attached to her the minute she appears in the movie. You go along with her sharing her joys and pains.The characterisation is so powerful that the viewers end up saying prayers for her in their hearts.This is one story that will remain close to your heart for a long, long time. Words will not do justice to the movie, you will have to watch it. A word of warning though - you will feel depressed for a day to a month depending upon how emotional you are. An excellent movie, 10/10."
