"I attended a special screening for Toy Story 3. I went in with HIGH expectations. I LOVED the first two Toy Stories movies. Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.This movie has a real chance to become the First Animated Film to win Best Picture. I surely would not be surprised.10/10 An Amazing End to a Fantastic Series Go Watch It"
"Lee Unkrinch directed ""Toy Story 3,"" the third and presumably final installment in the ""Toy Story"" movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's ""Toy Story 2"" remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto ""Toy Story 2"" for deep personal reasons, but ""Toy Story 3"" does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.As foreshadowed in ""Toy Story 2,"" Andy (John Morris) has finally grown up; he's 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. His mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic (a sort of gone-but-not-forgotten-and-within-reach-type of deal).Woody (Tom Hanks), brave leader of the toys and Andy's favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at Sunnyside Daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. This introduces us to Lotso (Ned Beatty), the strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metro-sexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and others. As it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and Lotso runs this place with an iron fist; of course, Lotso has a very tragic back-story that explains his evil ways, much like with Jessie (Joan Cusack), who first appeared in ""Toy Story 2."" So Woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college.""Toy Story 3"" is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first ""Toy Story,"" which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented Disney-owned animation studio Pixar. They have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. The animation here is at its most life-like and real and it's damn-near flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far Pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with ""Toy Story."" And every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories.While ""Toy Story 2"" had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, ""Toy Story 3"" is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. In addition, ""Toy Story 3"" can also be an incredibly dark film at times - a bold move considering that this is a family film - but there's no need to worry because the fact is that it's all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very light-hearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes.""Toy Story 3"" is a triumph of animation and imagination, and I say that as a die-hard ""Toy Story 2"" fan. What we get here, is a fitting closer (?) to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. It's just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone bye-bye.10/10"
"The best magic tricks in the world are ones that cannot be unraveled, reverse engineered or dissected to figure out exactly how they are pulled off. This philosophy is doubly applicable to Pixar's ""Toy Story 3"", the storyline-ending outro of the beloved Toy Story, uh, story.I feel it relevant somehow to divulge my age, as it somehow validates the powerful emotions evoked throughout the film. I am a 28 year old male, who, fifteen years ago, was fresh into the teen years of supposed adolescence at the release of some weird, 3d animated movie (wait, they can animate with computers?) entitled ""Toy Story"". This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gawd-awful.""Toy Story 3"" starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when ""Toy Story 2"" wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1's spark is TS2's candle, and that in turn is TS3's blazing sun.Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond.""Toy Story 3"" gets 10 of 10 blazing stars"
"I'm nineteen and I wasn't as enthusiastic about going to see this as I was when I was eight years old.I entered the theatre; the lights went out, the movie began, and after the first twenty seconds I was a child again. The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.I went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.This movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn't any. I'm sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre... The best part, you can bring your kids.I can't vote... in my opinion ten isn't enough!"
"Star Wars. Indiana Jones. Fistful of Dollars. Bourne. These are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. Yes, I am neglecting the fourth Indiana Jones. Upon the mention of the third Toy Story, I was deathly afraid. Afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story. Could part 3 even come close to the original two? My friends, I am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes.Toy Story 3 does exactly what the first two did, delivered on all cylinders, all aspects of film-making and entertainment. The humor is back, the heart is back, the delightful cast of characters is back. This time, thanks to an incredible script, there's more suspense, more drama, and many more surprises. Like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends. It literally is difficult to find any flaw or any slow moment in this movie, and even if there is, it will immediately be forgiven by the next major laugh or the next major revelation. The predictability factor in this movie is low, and the payoff to all the suspense is extremely high. Guys, this is the go-to movie of the summer, and makes up for any disappointment you have seen this year or last.Just like Toy Story 2's subtle and underlying themes, Toy Story 3 revolves around the group of toys and their latest adventure, but dwells far deeper than that. On the surface, this movie is about the toys in a series of circumstances, winding up in a daycare center that isn't all it seems. At the same time, Andy is heading for college, but Woody isn't quite ready to let go of his owner and the memories that follow. The deeper aspects involve aging, growing up, and moving on. Michael Arndt, the Oscar winner that wrote Little Miss Sunshine, was behind the spectacular screenplay in this third trip in the world of toys. Then with the help of John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich (who serves as the director), we see plenty of references to Pixar, other movies, the previous Toy Story installments, and even we even see nods to the influences of the entire animation studio (Miyazaki).The writing wasn't the only thing that was on par with the first two Toy Story movies. The voice acting cast was once again phenomenal, with popular actors, underrated talent, and great character actors filling the bill. Come on now, just read em': Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Jody Benson, Estelle Harris, Blake Clark, John Ratzenburger, Ned Beatty, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton. Unlike what Dreamworks pulls off on a yearly basis, Pixar carefully chooses their voice cast in terms of pulling off the best performances, not to generate more money. Because honestly, was there even a point to Angelina Jolie voicing the tiger in Kung Fu Panda? On the other hand, very few can pull an authentic Barbie like Jody Benson (a.k.a. Ariel in the Little Mermaid). It takes reliable and authentic acting to pull at the heartstrings, and everyone definitely was on their A-game.Lee Unkrich directed this movie with incredible pacing and just as much heart and dedication as Lasseter, who was in charge of the first two. The truth is, Pixar directs the movie together, as they share ideas and suggestions amongst each other. This fact can be traced to the similar pacing and directing styles seen in Pixar's better works like Ratatoille, Finding Nemo, and Up. They all have the similar technique of incorporating just as many tears as laughs. But unlike all the other Pixar movies (with the exception of The Incredibles), Toy Story 3 has a heave dosage of suspense and peril, which is climaxed by one of the most exciting animated sequences this side of Castle in the Sky (a Miyazaki adventure masterpiece). Other reviewers have noted this before me, but this Toy Story is quite scary in depth and in imagery at some instances, so be wary of this while watching this with the kids. With so much time invested with these toys, the drama runs a bit high.Bottom Line: Toy Story 3 secures its place in cinema brilliance by becoming the best third installment since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the best sequel since Kill Bill Vol. 2, and the best movie we've seen this year. This movie is usually hilarious, sometimes thrilling, and sometimes downright tear-jerking. And yes, just like Up's opening 10 minutes, there is that one major sequence in which Pixar will play with your heartstrings like Eric Clapton playing tears of Heaven. If you enjoyed the first two Toy Stories, there's no need to worry about the third and hopefully final chapter in the quality-filled saga. How Pixar manages to deliver yet again is absolutely beyond me.Walt Disney may not be one-hundred percent proud of his company if he were alive to see it now, but he would be absolutely delighted at seeing what beautiful art Pixar has delivered ever since 1995. Pixar has re-created Walt Disney 's magical methods of storytelling and movie-making, and arguably has taken it a step even further by adding depth to the characters and depth to the overall stories presented. The direction was fantastic, the writing was Oscar-worthy, and the overall production is Best Picture caliber. This is Pixar's best work since Finding Nemo, and a must see by any means necessary. Despite my cynical nature, there's no way I can grade this any less than perfect. Just no way."
"Since I felt none of the other reviews here do the movie justice, I became compelled to write my own. It is the most inspired film I have ever encountered.The creators of Toy Story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. I cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that I have ever seen to it. It is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys, the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. Yet, the Pixar Team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. The animation is so brilliant that it captures shading, lighting, and textures that have yet to be seen on film.Then, Toy Story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two, with very clever character development. Its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: Woody, the wise sheriff, leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog, slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of Ken and Barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. At the same time, Pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. It is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. But these toys never age, and as its owners, once in their playful youths, leave for work and college, these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. As you leave for work every morning, your dog doesn't know where you go. And every day, he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him, every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.Finally comes Pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear, love, action, and comedy, among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right, that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure, wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline, always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. It is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. I cannot wait to see it again."
"I was about 10 or 12 when I watched the first Toy Story in the cinema with my little brother and sister. We were all enchanted! Years later Toy Story 2 came out and it was a blast! Again we all went to the theater to see it and we were so thrilled and excited after the movie! Im 24 now, and just yesterday I was at the Bulgarian gala-premiere of the film. My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that's kinda natural for them. But still it feels like 100% Toy Story, with all the improvements, somehow I don't feel this 15-years-wide gap between the first and the third part.What matters more is the (Toy) Story itself! And it is just fantastic! I had really high expectations of this film and honestly, after seeing it, my expectations were surpassed! The plot is really emotional, with so many nostalgic moments... Being kinda grown-up myself, but doing my growing-up with the first two parts of Toy Story, I couldn't relate more with this one! I was really touched! I just wish the theater was empty. Then I could stop holding back my tears! And it's not just t the big story, but also all those little things that go on around it! I don't know how many of those references and gags were in the script and how many were put in there in the making process, but it's just amazing! Even if it's the most dramatic and the darkest of the 3 (as dark as Toy Story can get) the comedy is still there, and I was laughing out loud all the way through! It's a wild roller-coaster, and I'm not even sure who will have more fun with it, if it will be the kids, or their parents! There's just so much more in there for you to notice, admire and laugh at! And I'm sure that after watching the film again I'll find out even more! There's also a really neat Totoro cameo, and it's great of Pixar to pay homage to their old friend, Miyazaki san.The old lovable characters are all here, and they are joined by an army of new ones, and each one of them has his real personality and you can recognize in them characteristics of someone, both visually and with their attitude they express different things and you instinctively feel what these toys stand for. It's really funny to recognize in them some movie archetypes or features of people that you know.I realize that I just poured out tons of superlatives, but there's nothing else you can say about this film! It has everything! (And about how many 3rd parts you can say that?) The only thing I could criticize is that there is one really freaky baby-toy, that can give the creeps to the smaller kids, but it's done on a purpose and for me it was really an enjoyable touch to the atmosphere of the film.To wrap up this review, I will just say - Thank you, Pixar!"
"The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar's WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don't have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films."
"It was in 1995 that Toy Story signaled the arrival of Pixar, and the rest was history. To date, I have personally always found myself to have enjoyed all of their outputs, and it does seem that Pixar has indeed grown from strength to strength with sophistication in its graphics and attention to detail, but more so that their creative teams have always come out with solid stories to tell, which is always the key beneath all the glossy bells and whistles visuals.And I simply love this installment, not only because it reunites us with the characters whom we have taken to heart as old friends, welcoming them back to yet another big screen outing, but because it has a moving story to tell, and has various elements from action-adventure, comedy and drama all rolled into one, allowing an outpour of a kaleidoscope of emotions as we journey for close to 2 hours with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Mr and Mrs Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Res (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark) and the aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) for one last hurrah.The storyline for all three Toy Story films may share some similar plot lines in having the constant fear of being discarded and unwanted when one turns old, or to obsess with the thought of being forgotten and unappreciated, and almost always comes with a distance to conquer. That continues here in stronger terms given that it's been some 11 years since the last Toy Story film, and that the toys' owner Andy has already outgrown the toys and have chucked whatever's left all into a treasure chest. Making things worst, he's about to relocate to attend college, and thus the anxieties that Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang has to come to terms with, being provided 4 options of heading for the trash, the attic, being given away or being that rare toy that gets to accompany Andy to his new environment.New toys get introduced by way of how the story got crafted involving a children's day care centre, where we get to meet up with the over-emphasized, metrosexual Ken (Michael Keaton!) from Barbie (Jodi Benson), and others such as the Lotso bear (Ned Beatty), together with those belonging to a new human character called Bonnie (Emily Hahn) who owns a cool plush Totoro (which doesn't speak of course)! Sequels tend to overcrowd their stories with plenty of characters, but it worked perfectly for this installment as other than those which get lines, there are plenty in the background that you may just spot a few that you too may have owned at some point in time. Things also aren't quite what they seem at the day care being the paradise for toys in constantly being played with and loved but never to suffer a heartbreak or to be left feeling unwanted, and provides the basis upon which the story develops, providing plenty of challenges for the gang to overcome (gotta love that Monkey!)What's powerful about Toy Story 3 are the themes that get thrown in, such as that about loss, and the search and fight for things that are worthwhile. It emphasizes the bonds of friendship and courage, while tackling how the lack thereof in abandonment and the feeling of tremendous loss, can someone turn one into a bitter soul, which allowed for the film to take on tragic, darker consequences unseen in the earlier installments, while balancing the light hearted moments. We get to grow with the familiar characters a little more, while having new ones which are just as fun. Just ask Ken!And a word of caution - prepare those tissues and hankies! Parting is such sweet sorrow, and the manner in which director Lee Unkrich deals with will definitely tug at your heartstrings. At least two scenes got to me, one involving facing a consequence of inevitable hopelessness that is a definite edge of your seat stuff only to remind you of how much you really care for the characters, while the other was what I deem as the perfect send off, an au revoir fit for closing the chapter on this Toy Story arc, while leaving room for another to happen (if it does). It moved, and shows how valuable it is to be loved again, and I thought it was pitch perfect. It would be interesting to know how the creators had intended to end the story, but it was brilliant to have chosen with what was.Toy Story 3 is a must see, and it's contending for a space in my top 10 for the year. It's a sequel done right, a tale with a lot of heart, with elements encompassing what essentially is a fitting tribute and farewell to beloved characters that have blazed the trail for computer generated animation to take centerstage. As with all PIxar feature films, a short precedes the main feature, and ""Day and Night"", like the one offered in Up, comes without dialogue, but with plenty of imagination and again, a solid story for a well animated short film that only Pixar can."
"Andy is now seventeen years old and is going to college. His mother presses him to decide the fate of his toys, and Andy decides to leave them in the attic, with the exception of Woody that he intends to bring with him. However Andy's mother donates them by accident to the Sunnyside Daycare. The toys are welcomed by Lotso Bear but sooner they discover that the children mistreat them. Further, they are imprisoned in the daycare by Lotso and his gang. But Woody discovers the intention of the evil bear and returns to the daycare to organize the escape of his friends. ""Toy Story 3"" is a wonderful and touching animation for adults imagine for children. This magnificent tale of loyalty and friendship is fantastic and recommended for the whole family and it is a worth entertainment. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Toy Story 3"""
"Toy Story 3, perhaps the best animation made in cinema history has been, because after seeing this animation, each viewer feel that the characters of interest. The animation really neutral in terms of content and is unique. When you see that, like see professionals movie.Toy story 3 is not well a certain age-specific, anyone can see and enjoy.Other benefits include the animation can be pointed sense of unity and friendship.I think this animation become win best picture in this year.You can see anything in this animation, emotions, courage, love, comedy, action, drama and .... together. Before see this movie, I thought the best animation was ""Up"" but now, just Toy Story 3In the End, bye bye dear Toy Story 3 ,Thanks Pixar 10/10 Best animation ever"
"As a 28 year old single female lawyer, i have always enjoyed Pixar's movies. I cannot label them as cartoons as there is nothing cartoonish about their stories; they have heart, meaning, feel-goodness with the right touch of class & humor. The formula is A1 yet without feeling overused.Toy Story 3 is once again a hit. We are treated to our favorite familiar characters and reminded again why we like them so. They are heroes who share the same values of team spirit, bonding and camaraderie. No one gets left behind. The technical aspects are again flawless. This is one series of sequels i do not mind seeing for Toy Story 4, 5, 6...this is coming from someone who adamantly refused to watch Toy Story 1 & 2 and UP..up and until last week i forced myself to..and i was so blown away by all three i have never been gladder to be proved wrong.Watch this, and Pixar, don't stop making movies for us."
"I liked very much the other ""Toy Story"" films, and I loved all the Pixar films, finding all to be clever, well animated and with a good message for the children.""Toy Story 3"" manages to be both funny, clever and heartwarming, introducing a lot of new character, but no one of them feels out of place. Even the villain, Lotso the bear, it is pretty likable and interesting character.This is a beautiful goodbye letter to all those who loved the ""Toy Story"" saga since the beginning of it, and it is one of the most satisfying and heartwarming conclusions ever released for cinema. I highly recommend this film to anyone."
"After seeing Toy Story 1 and 2, they quickly became my favourite set of films ever and just last year when i heard there was going to be a 3rd, my heart immediately sank. As with sequels before, i thought it was going to be aimed at an entirely new audience, for the sake of profit and would squeeze the love i had for the series right out of it.Then i began to read about interviews and the plot line and how it continues from both previous films, with Andy just a child back then, he has now become a teenager ready for college. This got me a little excited and for the rest of the year building up to it i was looking more and more forward to it.Usually, walking out of cinema doors, i have a feeling of disgust and disgrace having just watched an awful film for a high price. So, it would have been safe to say my expectations for this film were ridiculously high, i mean there is not many series' of films that keep followers for 15 years.It felt like a mere 10 minutes that i had been in my seat when the film finished. I was on the verge of tears, had a huge smile on my face and almost felt the need to jump up and clap. There are few films like this out there, Toy Story 1 and 2 being the exceptions. It continued the story so well, you still had the same love for the main characters that you always did.For a film aimed at children, it had an amazing plot, that never confused but always kept you guessing. It is perfect for all ages, whether old or young, it is a magical story.My only criticism would be at the lack of characters from previous films. It was explained immediately whether they had been sold or lost but i really felt disappointed that some old favourites were missing.Still apart from that, the film was faultless. I recommend going immediately and watching it in 3D. Nothing really pops out in your face, but it is made really well to fit 3d."
"Well, this lived up to the hype, which usually isn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment with this one. Thankfully, it didn't happen. ""Toy Story 3"" was another amazing story in this (so far) trilogy.With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes. All three of these facets should make this a fun 103 minutes every time I watch the DVD, much like the first two. Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places. Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney (""Slinky Dog""), who died in 2000. It's great to still hear familiar and distinctive voices, such as those of Wallace Shawn (""Rex""), John Ratenzenber (""Hamm""), Don Rickles and Estelle Harris (""Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, respectively).Kudos to all those involved in making this film. They nailed the essence of ""Toy Story"" and how much loyalty can mean."
So I'm 26 and jaded. I most often hate the world and everything in it. Well that being said I absolutely lost myself watching this movie. I had seen the two before it as a kid growing up but I never felt so strong about them as I do with this one. I have spent the last couple weeks after seeing this movie spreading the word about how awesome it was. The theme is so universal that anyone despite their background or feelings can absolutely relate. We've all been to that place were we feel like we've been used and that were done with. The feeling as if we have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. I really want everyone to experience the overwhelming feelings that boiled inside of me as this movie came to an end. The second the toys held hands at one point my face absolutely exploded and from there it didn't relent. Seriously I could not breathe it was almost to much. But its not. Go see it. Now.......................................what are you waiting for?
"I went in with HIGH hopes and i was not disappointed! The first toy story movie was by far my favorite movie as a child, i literally watched it two or three times a day. Im emotionally attached to the toy story movies so this movie felt like the closing chapter to my childhood. Aside from my emotional attachment this movie was still amazing! I laughed, which is expected since its the all might pixar. But i also cried...i was kinda embarrassed haha. I was holding back the tears in this one scene but since i don't want to spoil anything so ill stop there. But by the end of the movie i couldn't hold back and instead of watery eyes i was in full tears haha. Everyone should watch it!"
"did anyone else cry like a little baby at the end? This sequel really exceeded my expectations greatly. i was almost expecting crap, but what i was given was an animated 3d masterpiece that makes you laugh, cry, and occasionally make you fear for the toys. my only problems were, no little Bo Peep, and, ( you may think i am a jerk for this) if the toys died at the end i would have been sadder, but it would make more sense for the letting go of your childhood part of the storyline, don't get me wrong, i love the originals and the current ending, it just would have made more sense with the storyline. thank you cast, crew and others, for this wonderful tear jerking, sometimes dark, masterpiece, about letting go of your childhood."
"Is ""Toy Story 3"" good? Yes, it is. Is it exciting? Yes. Is the animation good? Excellent. Is it worth the money? It's worth. Is it better than the previous two? Much, much better. ""Toy Story 3"" is an excellent movie for all ages.First, the animation. The moves of the characters are simply perfect. Ken and Barbie, they're robotic moves are so breathtaking. The moves are simply so detail and mesmerizing. The appearances. Not much to talk about. But, the appearances of the characters were perfectly designed. The main characters were really cool. Ken and Barbie, they're really designed in detail. For Barbie, the line where is visible in the neck was really detail. Ken is also really detail especially with his body. Lot-o-Huggin'-Bear was also carefully designed by the paper which often appears on dolls listing the warning or whatever.The way the movie is presented. Very well done. In around 90 minutes of running time (excluding ""Day & Night""), the movie was not boring at all. It had some laughable expressions which are pretty funny. I liked it when Buzz turns into Spanish mode where most of the audience laughed. That moment was hysterical. The scenes were also thrilling like the end scene (which I'm not going to tell you) or the scenes in Sunnyside. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.The new characters. Well, I think there's one negative point. I think little kids around the age of 3, 4 or 5 might be scared with the appearance of Big Baby, because, his appearance is kind of scary for little kids.The 3D effects. Not so cheesy and not so breathtaking but pretty good. The depths of the items in the film were not bad. The sound acting. They were really good. Tom Hanks on Woody was really good. He really projected his voice until he becomes a real Woody. Tim Allen on Buzz Lightyear was also good and satisfying. He really sounded like a real astronaut or space ranger. The others were also good. But, I think Tom Hanks on Woody still has the best projection of voice in the film.Final thing, the short film attached to it: ""Day & Night"". It was shockingly, awfully, crazily cool. That short film was quite funny. It was really good. Overall, the short film compliments to the film to be a very good movie.A short advise, you might want to prepare some tissues to wipe your tears as there are some pretty sad moments in the film. The scenes were just so sad that that's another praise for Lee Unkrich on his directing. So, if you don't prepare those tissues, I hope you have something you can use to wipe your tears.As an amazing end to such a magnificent trilogy, ""Toy Story 3"" is a must watch movie. Watching it in 3D is not a bad choice. Your kids will definitely be thrilled watching this film. I truly believe this is the best animated film of the year, or even the best film of all 2010 films. If you haven't watched this yet, what are you waiting for? Go purchase your tickets and enjoy this masterpiece. I guarantee you that you won't regret watching this movie. Overall, I give this movie a perfect score of 10 stars. I wish a fourth installment would be made."
"When I heard that Toy Story 3 was coming out, I felt two things: excitement and worry. Why the worry? Because despite Pixar's consistency with making fantastic films, I didn't want Toy Story's reputation to be marred by a slump in the franchise (Indiana Jones 4 anyone?).All these worries went away when I saw the film. It really is hilarious, and really tense in parts! It had everyone in the cinema genuinely cracking up. For me, it was a much better film than Toy Story 2, and I liked Toy Story 2 a lot. It's always great to catch up with gangs of characters as likable as these toys. I'm glad that they had material that was consistently hilarious throughout the movie and didn't just have a cop-out story to get more money from the franchise (again, Indiana Jones).One thing to note is how touching this movie is as well - people in the cinema were genuinely crying and upset. I don't cry at films, but this had me very close indeed.Anyhow, go to see this movie! You won't be disappointed and will laugh throughout. It's suitable for children and adults alike. :)"
"Is there Life after playtime? Can you handle a film in which the toys are playing with us, the audience? The third chapter of the Toy Story saga asks some tough questions of viewers, but the rewards of seeing this remarkable film outweigh the emotional toll.It's the last week of summer before Andy heads off to college, and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the other remaining toys in Andy's bedroom find themselves in fear of what's to become of them. It looks like the attic, but events conspire to throw them a day-care center called Sunnyside. It looks swell enough, at first...""You'll never be outgrown, or neglected,"" the toys are informed by the chuckily plush play bear Lots-O (Ned Beatty). ""Never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means - no heartbreak!""It's odd to see a film series that started out as an animated lark turn into ""Watership Down"", but there's always been some existential angst at the heart of the enterprise, c.f. the fragile buddy system employed in the first ""Toy Story"", Sid's hapless victims, and talk of rummage sales. The second film pushed these buttons a bit harder, to the point of losing the humor.This time the drama is stronger than ever, yet the film amazingly manages to stay refreshingly clever and hilarious. We meet Ken (Michael Keaton), who introduces himself to Barbie saying ""We were made for each other"". Ken must deal with wisecracks about being a girl's toy, or as Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) puts it, ""an accessory, a purse with legs."" The daycare center is also fabulously realized, a cacophony of misfit toys all showing signs of wear from constant play. Every now and again we break away to see Woody in his new situation, being played with by a girl named Bonnie who is very nice but has a left-field imagination. ""We do a lot of improv here,"" another toy tells him.All this is very funny, and director Lee Unkrich and the Pixar writers and artists find brilliant ways to keep humor close to the center of things throughout. Yet this movie is no lark. One of the funniest scenes the first time I saw this movie three weeks ago, involving a cutaway to a clown staring at a window, got hardly a laugh when I saw it again tonight. I think it was because the rest of the audience, like me, knew what was coming; a sad story about cosmic indifference and cold-hearted abandonment which sets in motion the real emotional undertow of the film.Set against this is Woody's firm if shaken resolution to ""be there for Andy"", even when it seems he and the other toys are no longer wanted by their owner. It's a message of faith you relate to, yet it also brings out another point, the notion of change, even painful change, as needful. The toys know they'll be neglected, perhaps forever, if exiled to the attic, but prefer it to the unknown. This actually makes sense. What can happen out there isn't very nice, but even in the face of extinction the film suggests a certain nobility through acceptance can be still possible. It's a pretty heavy message to take away from watching a G-rated comedy.The film doesn't leave you on a down note, but it's a funny thing. In the past, I always looked forward to the post-credit goof scenes as something to laugh at on my way out of the theater. This time, I appreciated it just as much as a chance to wipe my eyes before I got out of my chair. It still felt good, though."
"I am now 20 years old and so, it was at the age of 7 when I first watched Toy Story. I found it amazing that the toys were alive and all the story was superb either. When I found out that a 3rd part was up to be released I had been dreaming of it all the time. So, I went to watch it. In the theatre there were parents with their kids and thankfully they were really quiet. When the film started with the narration of the ages that had passed, I felt so touched. During the film I was back in my childhood when everything seemed -and were- so easy and I was with no concerns. All the purity of that age came and hit me, although I knew that would happen. I admit that I first found the story average, but when the film was on I was enchanted. There were no thoughts in my mind. I was there watching a masterpiece that in my point of view can be truly appreciated by only us, those who matured since the first movie, but still carrying all the heroes into our hearts. I must admit that I was up to cry in several moments, especially when the toys were in fire and in the end. Leaving the cinema and though I cried -cause, yes, I did!- I was too happy. Entering the house I was singing the theme song...I highly recommend it to you all!!!! 10/10..."
"I am 52 years old and have seen an embarrassingly huge amount of movies over the past 45+ years. Toy Story 3 is one of the best movies I have ever seen.It took me a few days to figure out why I was so affected by the movie. Toy Story 3 is really funny and imaginative, but so are a lot of other movies. I could see that the audience, including my own two children (16 and 11), were deeply engrossed in the film, laughing and crying, and bursting into applause together after the final scene. It is very rare today to see a theater audience having such a deep and common understanding of something as a group. I had seen this occur more frequently in the past, however, so the shared experience (while very nice) isn't really what makes the movie so great for me.I think that the movie is great because Woody has to struggle with his age and purpose in way that seems so shockingly real. In the first part of my life, I only wanted to find a role that was worthy of me, an education or a job or a spouse that would let me....well...what I did wasn't really important, only that I be the greatest at whatever unique thing I was supposed to do. In the second part of my life, I found myself doing something that wasn't unique - it was pretty much what others did; Nor was I the greatest - I was only average. But I did it anyway, because the things I was to trying create and help, both in job and family, those things were important, even if they were ordinary. In the third part of my life....I sense there will come a time when I will still be loved but not needed. And it has to be that way, because otherwise death would be too hard to bear, for me and for those I leave behind.I can accept all of this....but still be really happy when Andy plays with his toys one last time."
"I went in to the movie cinema to see this film with high hopes and expectations judging by the first and second films' brilliance and must I say that I was in no way disappointed and can actually state that this film is the best of the trilogy. These 2 movies were my favorites as a small child. When I say that this is the best of the three I bid no demotion of the standard of the first and second installments. I applaud Pixar on maintaining their perfect record.The film starts with a high action but still childish scene. True fans of the series would recognize that the scene is a revamped version of the two playtime scenes involving One- Eyed Bart and Pork Chop. Then starts a montage that shows how far and attached the toys have grown to Andy, their owner. Andy then plans to put the toys into the attic but they are accidentally put out with the trash. Later they venture to a daycare center in which first impressions were deceiving The real luster of the film hits a climax in the last 30 - 40 minutes in which we get to take in the emotional journey that the toys have made together as they head for an incinerator. The movie closes on Andy playing with his childhood friends for the last time. I bawled like a baby at this point.The new characters were a lively addition to the old gang. My personal favorite being Ken (Michael Keaton), the spunky, cool dream hubby of Andy's little sister's Barbie Doll. Barbie and Ken form their own little sub plot together with a rather amusing fashion scene. Also occurring were omissions of previous toys including Wheezy the penguin, Bo Peep and the toy soldiers who exile at the movie's beginning.Pixar have once again showed us that any movie that comes out their door will be coated in gold. Woody and Buzz have yet again proved to be Pixar's golden boys and the trilogy has ended with what is in my opinion the best movie ever made!"
"I left the theater in 1995 after seeing the original Toy Story strangely moved. I was only six years old, and I'm not sure I had even fully grasped the revolutionary CGI for what it was (it probably just registered as animation to me, and I didn't quite understand its impact), but I did know – at least on a basic level of storytelling – that it was fantastic. Four years later I went to see the sequel with my younger sisters and felt the exact same way I had the first time. Even at a fairly young age I knew there was something special about these films.Many times nostalgia has to compensate for quality (or lack thereof) in your perception of entertainments as you age. Suddenly Mac and Me isn't as awesome as you once found it to be. You revisit films from your childhood and learn to appreciate them based solely on the memories they conjure up, trying to block out the reality that, hey, This kinda sucks.That never happened with the Toy Story movies. As I grew older, as I saw them more and more times, they only seemed to improve. New layers appeared – adult humour that I never appreciated when I was ten but suddenly blindsided me. Characters that revealed new depths; emotional scenes that only became increasingly poignant and meaningful, like that amazing scene where Buzz first becomes aware of his own mortality as a toy that can't really fly, or when he learns to cope with that fact by embracing the fact that he can instead fall rather well (with style).The point of this rambling trip down memory lane is that Toy Story, the whole legacy of it, means a lot to me. I grew up with these pictures and never tired of returning to them, and they were always there for me like a good friend is. I approached Toy Story 3 with the slightest of reservations, fully trusting Pixar, and yet wondering how they could possibly produce anything that would live up to such high standards.Well, suffice to say, they did it – if Toy Story 3 isn't the best of the series, then that's merely because it comes eleven years after the last one and it hasn't been given some time to work its full magic on us. This is every bit as engaging, heartwarming and funny as the first two films – but it's also the saddest, most human and most moving.The plot has already been outlined by other critics, so I don't feel a need to recap anything. Nor do I want to inadvertently spoil any key moments (and please, for your own sake, avoid reading too much about the movie before going to see it – some reviewers are a bit too keen on giving away the ending, although it's understandable given how surprisingly emotional it is).The introduction of new characters is seamless – Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) is hilarious but thankfully not overused, and the other assorted variety of toys, including Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), are fine additions to the series.And Woody and Buzz (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, respectively) pick up right where they left off, and you feel, in a weird way, like you're visiting old pals. The movie features the best animation of the trilogy, and the second half – which is darker than the two previous installments – makes excellent use of lighting and cinematography. The climactic finale is incredibly intense (especially for a ""kids movie"") and features particularly impressive visuals. Many reviewers have noted that they cried during the finale, and even I must admit that I came pretty close.In a summer full of bores, disappointments and under-achievers, Toy Story 3 is not merely the first thoroughly satisfying motion picture of the season – it's the only truly moving one. It is fairly ironic, perhaps, that we must turn to movies about pieces of plastic to find such poignant reflections upon human nature, but then again, I'm not sure I'd want to have it any other way."
"Toy Story 3 brings back nostalgia, but that's to be expected. We all think back to fifteen years ago, or eleven years ago, when the Toy Story movies came out the first time. If you're too young for that, then at least the re-release was last year to catch people up, though it's not quite the same thing. As Andy is off to college- as was predicted would happen as a given in Toy Story 2- we in the audience realize that this third film follows a kind of time-line that runs with our lives. Even if you're an adult (i.e. older than my 20-something age) you can relate to what the toys and Andy are going through. What happens at the end of the film, the resolution of the ultimate conflict of what to do with the toys as life goes on, is one of the most beautiful and heartwarmingly bittersweet (well, more like sad-sweet) moments in recent cinema. Pixar tends to do that.This is the kind of third movie that makes it a trilogy- it's hard to see it going on to a fourth film and having any kind of the same resonance- and one that seems perfectly fit together in terms of a progressing story. But where something like Star Wars saw the second film as the darkest and third one coming into (somewhat) lighter terms, this is not quite the same with Pixar's baby. Toy Story 3, with it becoming a prison movie in more than just a sense (the toys get sent to Sunnyside Daycare, run by a cute-looking but ruthless bear voiced by Ned Beatty), and what happens in said prison. To be sure, other cute things abound in the movie, from Peas-in-a-Pod to (yes) Totoro from Miyazaki's movie. But in that prison, and other things that happen such as the trip to the junkyard/landfill, it gets dark.And yet, Pixar continues their outstanding method of storytelling and entertainment: nothing is even scaled-down for kids, and nothing is too sappy for adults. A couple of obvious song choices aside- 'Dream Weaver' for when Ken and Barbie first meet, and 'Freak Out' as Ken hilariously tries on a wardrobe- there's nothing that doesn't work for kids and adults, equally, and often more-so for adults than kids (I wonder, for example, when Buzz is reset and becomes El Buzzo and speaks Spanish if the wee little ones will be able to read the subtitles). When it's funny the humor is aimed at sophisticated one-liners and, yes, sophisticated (or just well-timed) slapstick, when there's action it's intense just as in the previous Toy Stories, and when it's heartbreaking it'll make everyone in the audience cry. I wonder if Pixar has some kind of magic movie-voodoo to get the old adage to come alive: you'll laugh, you'll cry- and sometimes in the same breath! The new toys are great additions, but they never detract from the classic cast. And even with them, and the great dynamic of the daycare center and its prison atmosphere, we never get lost in the shuffle of toy conflicts and desires and dreams halted (Lotso's backstory is like a twisted version of Jessie's story from Toy Story 2). It would also be a given to say that the animation keeps getting better, a little higher quality in stylization and panache, but the animators and filmmakers also aim higher in a number of ways. The opening of the film, with its grand depiction of what's going on inside of Andy's mind as he plays with his toys, an Old West-Sci/fi hybrid complete with a train full of troll orphans and Hamm as a giant flying pig-spaceship-weapon, is so epic as to seem like it's out of a much bigger Summer Action Blockbuster than it should be. Or rather, Toy Story IS this summer's big Blockbuster, and it's epic enough to be qualified as a kind of mini-masterpiece - that is, until the rest of the film unfolds.At the least, Buzz dancing to Spanish Salsa music, and that end of the movie, make it one of the high points of Pixar's career - and this is following WALL-E and Up!"
"Just how good is ''Toy Story 3'', you ask? It's simply one of the greatest achievements in movie history, I answer. This film, right now, should win the Oscar for Best Picture, hands down. I honestly doubt there'll be a better film than this all year. That's how absolutely brilliant this movie is. Pixar is officially king of everything! This movie is smart funny, thrilling, engaging, and, most importantly, it taught me about friendship. It taught me to stick by my friends, no matter what. The final sequences of the movie are absolutely breathtaking, and I couldn't help but shed a few tears. It doesn't feel like you're watching an animated movie. In some scenes it feels like you're watching an Alfred Hitchcock film, due to the great thrills, and others you can't help but cry over due to the togetherness of the whole gang. One of the film's themes is obviously never give up. This film can really inspire you. This film is also about loss and letting go. Who knew a film about toys could have such true themes on life. This is a masterpiece, one that once again pulls you in with the characters from the second it starts. Don't go see the grotesque Adam Sandler comedy ''Grown Ups'', or the action flick ''Knight and Day''. Go see this. This film is about a quintillion light years better than both those films. This beats, as great as they were, the first two ''Toy Story'' films. It beats them by a lot, actually. Take your family to go see this, but also, if you're an adult, go see this with adult friends. This is a film to go see with friends. This is the best from the greatness that is Pixar. 10 out of 10, a miraculous, comedic, inspiring, joyful, entertaining, adventurous, smart, tear jerking, and enduring film to cherish until the end of time."
"Oh my god, I cannot stress how good, no GREAT, this movie is! The animation is top notch, of course! You can almost feel the texture of the cloth Woody or Bullseye is made out of just based on it's looks. That's how good it is. The voice acting- superb. They have the original cast with a few added into the mix (some are subtle, like Bonnie Hunt or Whoopi Goldberg), and EVERYONE fits their part! Music- Randy Newman, you never fail to disappoint me, and this is no exception. Humor- Joke after joke, coming at you like bullets, leaving you no time to catch you breath because you're laughing so hard- until the climax, when you are either bawling your eyes out, or your heart is pounding at the speed of light, or both. There are many emotional parts in this movie that you won't forget, especially if you are an adult and have had that one bunch of special toys you just didn't want to let go of when you were a kid. Writing, music, humor, animation, acting, and emotion were all the best in any movie of 2010 and I seriously hope this wins Best Animated Feature, Best Music, and at least be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. So bottom line is- stop reading this review, get off the computer, and go see this movie! And if it's already out on DVD by the time you're reading this, go buy it!"
"So I saw Toy Story 3 tonight at an early screening here in Houston, TX. A little background info about me. I am a big, no HUGE, Pixar fan, I've watched every film that they have created dozens of times. Let me begin, this is definitely no Ratatouille, Wall-E, or Up. Pixar is definitely coming back to it's family roots and Toy Store 3 is extremely evident of that. Don't get me wrong, Pixar has completely outdone themselves once again offering a film that is extremely entertaining, thrilling, and fresh, but it is kind of disappointing that the film doesn't reach any true depth until the POWERFUL last act.I'm going to divide my review into several sections.Writing: The humor was straight up HILARIOUS. There were several scenes that had the audience ROTFL'ing, even I, as crude and bitter I may be when it comes to comedy, was laughing out loud at a few parts. However some jokes do fall flat into Dreamworks territory with potty humor (lincoln logs anyone?) which I hope does not become a recurrence, but overall the film had some wonderful writing and dialogue creating a truly believable setting and tone.Animation: It's truly a shame that some of the later scenes in the final act haven't been shown in the commercials because, DAMN, the detail is truly remarkable. Since this is a no spoiler review I won't move further into that but let me tell you now, you will be impressed. Humans are beginning to look more realistic with ton's of attention to movement and the toys have benefited from some spackle in the facial department in an attempt to create a more emotionally expressive character. While it didn't blow me away like Finding Nemo and Wall-E did when they released, the work done here by Pixar is truly solid and way above anything Dreamworks has brought to the table. The 3D is also decent, I'm not really buying into this whole fad because after a few minutes you don't notice the effect. The added depth is nice but you honestly won't be missing much if you watch it in a good quality cineplex.Sound: The theater I went to had a pretty weak sound system so I can't really comment on the effects but when it comes to voice talent, the actors truly shine. It was sad to see some characters go like Bo Beep and Squeaky but some of the new additions like Lotso and Ken, played by Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton, are some true standouts thanks to the excellent dialogue provided by the script. All the original characters once again do their job quite well and with the excellent editing and mixing, the dynamics of social interaction between the characters are expressed clearly.Depth/Theme: You know I was going here and I HAD to talk about it. Ratatouille had the whole analysis of segregation with ""Everyone can cook"", Wall-E brought environmentalism, consumerism, capitalism, and most importantly love to the table, while Up directly deals with death and the emotions that stem from it. Toy Story 3 repeats the abandonment and moving on angle from Toy Story 2 which is TRULY the film's weakest link. Not because the movie copies the second films moral, but because TS3 virtually ignored these themes until the last act which I will admit was quite compelling. It would have been nice to spread these serious moments throughout the film to create a balanced equilibrium but unfortunately this does not happen. However I do want to talk about this pivotal juncture in the final act, there was a moment in the movie that only last a minute or two, but felt very, very, very real. I can't stress this enough, I have never felt anything like this from a movie. The first time I cried in a move was with Up's ""Ellie"" sequence but for some reason I didn't do it here. My emotions went beyond crying, I don't know if it was the swirling bright ember colors contrasting with the stark images or the expressiveness of the toys in that very moment, but I sat there in disbelief and was affected in a way that has not existed before.Overall: I really do wish that Lee Unkrich could have spread the last 15 minutes throughout the movie but that didn't happen which is why I could not give this movie a 10, however, that last act SAVED this motion picture from being another run of the mill Dreamworks film. Aside from some of the lame toilet humor and disappointing direction choices, Toy Story 3 is a very solid conclusion to one of the best trilogies of all time that needs to experienced solely for the last beautifully gratifying act with the gang that I grew up with."
"I wanted to view all of the Toy Story movies in preparation for Toy Story 4. I had seen 1 and 2 as a kid so the rewatches were nice, but Toy Story 3 was fresh and I loved it! The call backs to the previous two films were great. The three highlights were those that we have grown accustomed to in all Toy Story movies: A delightful and cheery score, phenomenal voice acting, and an interesting story that teaches a moral lesson. Looking forward to the fourth installment tomorrow!"
"To put this review in perspective, I am 26 y/o. My fiancé is 28, and we went to see this together last night (forewarned that we may need tissues - which we both did!).**There be (tiny) spoilers ahead, so please don't read on if you don't want any inkling of what's in store for you. Suffice to say, we thought TS3 is an absolute triumph and I guarantee that you're going to love it!** Firstly, the ""Day & Night"" short. Seriously, Pixar was just showing off! They knew they needed to be better at 3D than pretty much everybody else, and they are. The short was crazy - I haven't seen 2D and 3D mixed like that before, and to do it so expertly was gobsmacking. So, once we saw that, we knew TS3 was going to be GOOD.We recently went to see Shrek 4 and thought that, in order to make the characters seem fresh and exciting, Dreamworks basically resorted to giving the entire cast a personality transplant. So we were delighted that Pixar, who have clearly won the battle of the 3D animation giants with Toy Story 3, stayed true to the characters and their personalities as well as their standard of high quality story-telling, clever dialogue and excellent direction, and still managed to keep it fresh, exciting, emotive, and entertaining.The themes running through the film are similar to those in the previous 2: loyalty, abandonment, friendship, ownership, new beginnings, journeys and getting that all-important play-time! But you don't feel like you've seen it all before. On this note I'm glad they didn't stick with ""Demo"" Buzz for very long, while ""Spanish"" Buzz has me in fits of giggles even a day later (whatever happens do NOT leave the cinema until the end of the credits!).Secondary and new characters were surprisingly well-developed (Dreamworks should take a few notes I think) and even the 'baddies' had understandable feelings and motives while being just menacing enough. I personally felt sorry for the slightly sinister baby, and was happy to hear baby gurgles at the end after that hilarious raspberry! He doesn't say a word in the whole film, but I still cared about that baby toy. That says a whole lot about the sheer mastery of Pixar's storytelling, which had me gripped, laughing, excited, tense, sympathetic, empathetic, and a whole gamut of emotions you just don't think one film can make you feel, but somehow TS3 does.It's been a while since one movie made me feel so much in such a short time; a very long time since the audience remained in the theatre for the credits, and even longer since the audience applauded at the end of the movie. I left feeling a little sad (poor Andy, not having ANY toys anymore!), but happy, very satisfied and a little awed by the whole experience. It really was that good, and that moving, and that entertaining. If it's not one of the greatest movies of all time, let alone animations, I think there's no justice in the world.Should there be a TS4? I thought Bonnie was cute, the perfect person to receive Andy's legacy, and her existing toys are funny and sweet. Personally I would love to see more of Mr Pricklepants the thespian, and Bonnie was so adorable it'd be lovely to get into some of her games. But even if there isn't a 4th movie you know that all the toys are going to be happy with her, and have some awesome supernatural adventures! This is definitely going into my DVD collection - I'd buy it for the Buzz/Jessie paso alone. Whoever thought of a matador-posing, paso-dancing Buzz should get a pay raise because that was inspired.Honestly, the best movie I've seen in AGES. Go see it, and you'll love it like pretty much everyone else lol Will be watching the Oscars with interest..."
"I randomly wonder if the Toy Story trilogy created any hoarders, because if I were a child and saw these films, I'd become a hoarder—just sayin'.The complaint that I see through many reviews is that the animation isn't adequate. Really? Pathetic excuse for people that claim to love movies. Ick.Pixar makes me feel good without making me feel guilty. Thank you seems so small in comparison to what they've given and as saccharin as this sounds; it's true. It's so hard to get a close to wholesome experience at a film in today's industry and Pixar can be trusted to do just that. Their films are wholesome because they do their darnest to make them so and families appreciate that more than they probably will ever know.I wondered how they were going to get to Sunny Side and the film sets it up perfectly. Like dominoes falling one after the other the things that go wrong have the toys end up at the day care only to want to go back home. Perfect display of story creation is taking a simple concept and squeezing an amazing adventure out of it. Many themes run through the film such as feeling unwanted, misunderstandings, bullying, jail break/escape, and then the wonderful reunited moment.The Toy Story Gang is back sans Bo Peep and I'm not as sure as to why. Maybe there's an interesting story in there somewhere or I missed the explanation in the film. There are so many great moments that I can't pick one. The Ken (Michael Keaton) and Barbie (Jodi Benson) moments were so cheesy they were awesome. They were cheesy in an 80's kind of way. Plastic perfect, if you ask me. Buzz (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack) connect in an adorable manner. Her infatuation with him while he's stuck in Spanish mode had her in a Latin heat mood smoldering in ways no one thought a little cowgirl doll could. Andy and Woody (I know, I know) have a strong connection that is shown in Toy Story and takes a great turn in beginning and even bigger one in the end.John Morris grew up with many of the viewers on Toy Story as Andy for all three movies. Random awesome factoid.If Toy Story 3 (and I'm only reminded of the Oscars cause of what I read in someone else's review) doesn't dominate the Oscars it would be a travesty. It is by far the best film of the year (thus far) and I'm sure that won't change too much this summer.The end of Toy Story 3 takes all of Toy Story history and makes the caring moviegoer, who supported the film from the onset in 1995 until now, break down and cry for toys. How incredibly gifted a storyteller are these people? This is why the bar will remain unbreached because they not only set it high, they make it insurmountable. The tears for the toys are more for what we all miss. It's the carefree feeling, the love for the simple and the power of imagination that is lost when we cross a certain threshold and nowadays the age gets younger and younger. When people watch Toy Story 3, not only are they a little shocked by the dark nature it takes on, they cry because of the goodbyes. They do so because they'd trade all of what they have in technology to have that mindset again. With the last scene the classic song playing, ""You got a friend in me"" Toy Story 3 ends in the most amazing way possible for a film that made us all believe that toys come to life the moment our backs are turned. Pixar has given what many creators of worlds wish to give and that's immortality engraved on the hearts of film lovers that'll last ""to infinity and beyond."""
"I have to say, I'm not a big uber fans of toy story, I watched TS1 and TS2 and while I can say they're good, but they're not really unforgettable for me...Seeing the trailer of TS3 in the cinema, I wasn't expecting lots of things since I thought the setting will be kinda boring (come on the background story is they're going to be left off and they're going to do adventure only within the daycare), one of the reason I wanted to watch it is because it's in 3D, and I've watched all the prequel...It turned out to be one of the best movie experience that I had in years! This is how an animation/family movie should be!I watched it without a lot of expectation, but it slapped me right in the face and I can't take my eyes of the screen for the whole movie!!The opening was brilliant! and so how the story developed, it's just fun! I had great laugh! esp when mr potato head turned into tortilla and later comes back as a cucumber (which I think more like a giant jalapeno) and also when buzz go to espanola mode...and the ending...it was also very good, I couldn't really tell what the ending would be and what woody is writing until Andy stopped in front of a normal house...and during the ending scene, I'm sure lots of the adults audience shed a bit of tears or had teary eyes :DThis is one movie that I would recommend to everybody, hell, I even register to IMDb exclusively just to say that this movie is this good!If you want to have a good laugh with your loved ones, or just by yourself, or with your family, this is the movie to go with!Great job Disney n pixaar! To infinity and beyond!!! 9.9 out of 10!"
"I'm not as eloquent as all the other people who have been writing reviews on here. But I'm absolutely a huge Toy Story fan, especially since I was 7 years old when the first one came out in 1995, and I've watched it so many times I can basically quote the whole movie.Needless to say I've been excited about Toy Story 3 for months, ever since I found out it was coming out. And for some reason I wasn't even worried that it wouldn't be good. Somehow I just knew it would be. And wow was I right. I dragged my friend to the movie with me, and even though she's not a huge Toy Story fan, she loved the movie too. I laughed out loud during almost the entire movie, and could not believe that parts of it actually made me cry. Toy Story 3 was magical, wonderful, amazing, brilliant, and so fabulously done. And my words aren't even doing justice to it! Really! So if you haven't seen it, just go see it!! Pixar isn't just for kids. But we're all kids at heart anyway. If you're like me, and you grew up with Toy Story, it being that one movie that you watched over and over and over again, driving your parents crazy, then you absolutely MUST go see this movie, and you'll love it. Thank you, Pixar!!!!!"
"I think the harshest thing I could say about the latest Pixar adventure, or Toy Story movie, for that matter, is even attempting to determine with Toy Story film is the best.How Pixar does it blows my mind. Time and again. Sure, they start with what I consider the number one quality of any movie: story. Character depth and development ranks second for me. Despite all my male-counterparts that simply love action, things blowing up, beautiful women (or people,) etc., fall behind – far behind – the front two. Toy Story 3 has all qualities needed to make a fantastic, adventurous and successful movie for tons of people of all creeds. But it puts both of my favorite staples first: excellent story with (yes, even animated) deep characters. And it's a lot of fun to boot.Starting off with a literal bang, Toy Story 3 sets the scene early that these ""Toys of Owner Andy"" love to be played with. It's what they were made for, what they yearn for and it gives them hope and a soul. Unfortunately for them, like the expiration on food, (yes, even Twinkies, thanks Zombieland) kids grow up and out of toys.Will Andy be faithful, keeping his prized Buzz Lightyear (Allen,) Woody (Hanks) or (most of) the rest of his toys, ones adults like me grew up with in Toy Story and Toy Story 2? Kinda.As in usual Toy Story fashion, there are mishaps and the adventure begins! Follow the toy crusaders from this point on from Andy's house to the curb, from the day care of hell to new child's house and so on.I would hate to even divulge in more of the secrets, twists, turns, comedy (and I mean roll on floor laughing humor), suspense or ideas presented. I can't imagine even some movie-goers on the fence that actually ""have to decide"" to see it.As equally tough as it would be to rank all Pixar movies – though, I plan to – and rank these Toy Story movies in order, it would be equally hard to pinpoint the best parts of Toy Story 3, aside from to aforementioned great script and characters. But, I'll try.I loved the monkey! Though brief, I laughed so hard every second he was on screen. Furthermore, I loved the other new characters, especially Mr. Pricklepants (Dalton.) I loved the intro. I loved the plan of escape. I loved the Ken ""secret"" references. I loved the español. I loved the comity (as found in the other Toy Story movies, but I would say it's most evident in this feature) between the leads, as well as newcomers. I loved the extreme attention to detail, the crispness of the film and the cinematography while never forgetting this is a cartoon. (And to add to that, by far, the graphics and technology has tripled this time around, even though the previous groundbreaking entries were still way above par.) I loved the overall comedy, including the tongue-in-cheek jokes. (I actually found myself laughing hard and out loud at some of the under-the-radar jokes that apparently no one else either caught or cared for. It was a tough and somewhat quiet crowd around me – aside from the annoying and crying kids and their equally inattentive guardians who don't know how to muffle their kids.) I love that as well created and designed it is, this could very well be a stand-alone feature, though it helps to see the first two and it does play homage to fans of the other Toy Story movies. So much so, it's hard NOT to get choked up in the finale, if you can make it that far without getting somewhat emotional.That's just a short list. There's so much wonder and awe and it's jaw dropping that Pixar, or the returning voice talent/actors could pull this offagain. But they did. It's highly recommended, and I would say to see it on IMAX 3-D for the quality and grand scale – like I did, but Disney STILL has yet to shock me with their ""version"" of 3-D. I was blown away during the 3-D in Monsters Vs. Aliens, but here, like in Up, it was so-so. Thankfully, Pixar does know how NOT to rely on 3-D as a gimmick. They spend their money on the talent to create everlasting stories, fun and adventures.Side Note: The preceding animated short, one I always look forward to prior to any Pixar film, Day & Night, was pretty good, and inventive, but not great. At least it featured Vegas."
"Again, I don't mean to sound like a broken record but it seems like Disney/Pixar is the only competent movie company that produces great films and classic stories. They know how to write, shoot and tell a story well. Toy Story is Pixar's baby, at the time of the first film's release and was the start of what we have today with computer animation. Now the first Toy Story was good, the second Toy Story was great and Toy Story 3 was absolutely fantastic. The stories just get better and better as they keep coming. Bringing back our favorite characters but adding a fun new little twist to them, it brought a new audience in and kept the one's who saw the first one and gave us something new to enjoy. Pixar's last films like Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up kept raising the bar higher and higher, not only are they Disney's great films, but they're also some of the strongest and best films of all time. Toy Story 3 can now be added as this is my favorite of the trilogy, bringing in some great new characters and magic to the story, I couldn't stop laughing and crying with this movie. I thought this was a perfect ending to the trilogy as it gets to all the adults when we had to grow up and give up our childhood toys.Now seventeen years old, Andy has outgrown his old toys and is preparing to move to college. He decides to take Woody with him and packs the other toys in a garbage bag, intending to store them in the attic, but Andy's mom mistakenly puts the bag on the curb. Believing that Andy no longer wants them, the toys sneak into a box to be donated to Sunnyside Daycare. As the only toy who saw what really happened, Woody tries to clear up the misunderstanding, but the other toys refuse to believe him and they are all driven to Sunnyside. Woody tries to convince the others to return to Andy, but they decide they are happier at Sunnyside, so he leaves without them. The others soon discover that Lotso had placed them in a room of toddlers, whose young and rambunctious nature causes them to abuse and torture the innocent toys. Woody learns that Sunnyside is a toy prison. Realizing their error, the toys try to leave but are imprisoned by Lotso, the head bear of the toys and his henchmen. Woody must return to Sunnyside to help his friends break out.One of the things I absolutely loved about this film was that it is darker than other family animated movies, I felt like this one had to be as it's really sad that Andy has to say good bye to his toys. But I was telling my friends the other day how it's sad because a lot of animated films while they're good, our films that we grew up with always had a dark touch like Who Framed Roger Rabbit or The Lion King, along with others long before those films. I thought maybe this generation was just a bit wussy when it came to having a little bit of a scary story. But Toy Story 3 has some genuinely chilling moments, the group of evil henchmen toys turn Buzz evil and it is actually kind of creepy the way they come at him. I loved when they put our group of toys in the bins and had a little tribute to some great prison movies, something for the adults to enjoy. I also saw a little Puss in Boots when the group gets a hold of Buzz and resets him by accident turning him into Spanish Buzz Lightyear, I couldn't stop laughing at his actions and lines. Incredible animation, great story along with a strong cast, this was a terrific film that I was so glad to see. I don't like to over hype a movie because you'll have a certain hope for it, but I went in with high hopes and not only got what I wanted, but much more. I can't wait for this movie to be added to my DVD collection. It's a new classic that I'm sure you'll absolutely love.10/10"
"I've seen a lot of disappointing three-quels in my days. Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Spidey 3, X-Men 3, Rush Hour 3, and much more. But this movie is not only a great three-quel but it could be the best three-quel of all time. Everything in this movie is excellent and I mean everything! It is dark, hilarious, clever entertaining, colorful, amusing but most of all it is very emotional, especially at the end. Thankfully, I did not cry on the outside but I cried a lot in the inside. Toy Story 3 is unforgettable and I am sad that there will never be another toy story movie but unfortunately it had to be ended. What a way to end a perfect movie and, I believe, the greatest trilogy of all-time. I am begging every single person to go see this movie instead of some crap like Prince of Persia, robin hood, the A team, or especially Jonah Hex. This is the best movie of the year and is the best movie of the decade... so far."
"Let me first start off by saying that this was my most anticipated movie of the summer. Not Ironman 2, not A-Team or Karate Kid, no it was Toy Story 3. Many of my friends laughed at me because I was going to see this movie with anticipation. I still maintained my dignity because, well, Toy Story was my favorite Pixar film and it was a good part of my childhood.So, in honor of that, I went to go see Toy Story 3. First there's this short, called DAY AND NIGHT, which actually fascinated me. It was a mixture of hand-drawn animation and the 3D we are accustomed to today. I don't want to say too much about it, but if you really put some thought into it, it's pretty deep.Then it was Toy Story 3 itself. I must admit, I wasn't sure if the film was showing promise in the beginning. I got what was going on but, well, there was a storm outside and my mind was lingering on that. I was thinking, ""Man, if this film isn't any good really soon, I'm going to go check out this storm!"" I love storms, as you can probably tell. And I was soon regretting paying for my ticket that night and waiting for the matinée the next day.Then something happened. I forgot about the storm. I was sucked into this film. I was engrossed into the characters once more, the story, the environments, and I soon came to realize that nothing was really lost between Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2. Pixar, yet again, makes a satisfying film.After watching this film, I went home and I read a lot of other reviews, mainly those on IMDb.com. A lot of people talk about the climax of the film and how epic it is. It is. There's a lot going on and there's a lot of excitement in every turn. What makes this climax work, is something called EMOTION, which a lot of films seem to lack. You see, when you care about the characters that are put on screen, it generates reaction from the audience. It's an art form that is not easily mastered but somehow Pixar is able to wave that magic wand.However, the ending does lead to a flaw for me. It's how they written in how the bad guy of the movie gets what's coming to him. To me, it felt shoehorned into the script. It's like saying, ""Hey, how are we going to get rid of this guy now?"" And then someone is like, ""Well, let's just throw this scene here and DONE!"" Really, it was a little unsatisfying for me but that's about the only flaw I could really think of in the whole film.And last but not least, I cannot forget to mention Ken, voiced by Michael Keaton. Let's just say he made the movie. It was like that extra ingredient to make an already great film even better. In fact, I could hardly tell it was Michael Keaton. I had to really hone in on certain mannerisms of his voice to catch that it's him. Seriously, he was a riot and it almost seemed like he was having a lot of fun in that sound booth.All and all, check out Toy Story 3. Hopefully your friends won't laugh at you like they did to me!"
"The one name in Hollywood today that can be truly, universally trusted every time is Pixar Animation Studios. Their two ""missteps"", ""Cars"" and ""A Bug's life"", are disappointments only in that they don't contend for best movie Pixar has made. They're A minuses instead of A's. ""Toy Story 3"" joins the pantheon of great Pixar films, and all-time great sequels. It stands out as the best film of 2010 at this point. While it may not be as brilliant from start to finish as the second ""Toy Story"" film (the animated equivalent of ""The Godfather Part II""), is so engaging, so witty and entertaining and exciting, that adults and children will be pulled in all the way. And the third act ramps up the emotion to a degree equal to the best of it's predecessors (my 5 year old nephew had to turn around and ask ""why are you cwying?"") The highly publicized plot line deals with the toys beloved owner Andy moving on to college, and choosing the fate of his beloved toys. Through one of those complex farcical events that seems so common in Andy's household, the attic bound toys (minus Woody, who is supposed to go to college with Andy) are accidentally donated to a daycare center. Woody, of course, has to rescue his friends, but there is some doubt as to whether they want to be rescued: Andy hasn't played with them for years, and the daycare, a toytopia presided over by lovable teddy bear named Lotso Hogs Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty, in a welcome return to the screen), promises the chance to be played with everyday. And when these kids get older, new kids replace them. To the love starved toys (especially Jesse the yodeling cowgirl, who is terrorized of repeating the experience she had with her beloved Emily), this seems like the opportunity of a lifetime. It goes without saying that all is not as it seems.Part of the genius of Pixar is that, in what are ostensibly children's films, they deal with very sophisticated and adult themes. Here, the struggle to grow up while holding onto the joy of childhood is captured beautifully, as are the themes of moving on and dealing with the loss of loved ones (there is a a brief reference early in the film, just a few lines, where Woody's reaction, between the animation and the greatness of Tom Hanks voice acting, is an exquisitely subtle and poignant heartbreaker). And, of course, the comedy is hilarious. I wouldn't have thought there was still new material left to be milked from the Potato Head's detachable appendages, but the new twists are innovative and hysterical.If you have kids, take them to ""Toy Story 3"". If you don't, go anyway. Pixar has once again proved that they are the most reliable name in film today."
"I've said this before, but I'll say it again: Pixar has shown with their initial ten films that they haven't the faintest clue how to make a bad movie. And yet, somehow, I always find myself feeling doubtful whenever a trailer for one of their new films is released. With Toy Story 3, I got the impression that it would be just another adventure with Woody and the gang for the sake of having one. So, with this, and a movie year that has been relatively lacking so far, would Toy Story 3 disappoint? The answer: absolutely not.Probably the most surprising aspect about this film is that, even after eleven years since the release of Toy Story 2, the material that has made this series so damn enjoyable hasn't been lost one bit here. All of the old characters are just endearing as ever, if not more so, and all of the new ones feel right at home here. Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) is especially hilarious, to the point where even the mention of him got me laughing.To touch briefly on the visual front, the characters themselves are just as expressive as they've always been. However, like Wall-E, the world that they inhabit looks much more photorealistic this time around. Also, this is one of the few instances when the 3D aspect actually enhances the film. It's by no means as crucial to the experience in the same way that it was for Avatar, but it gives the film a little extra something.The action sequences, too, are spectacular. These are toys that we're talking about, and somehow, Pixar's managed to provide these scenes with one hell of a punch. Not much else to say about 'em other than that the climax in particular feels as epic as anything from The Lord of the Rings trilogy.What really puts Toy Story 3 above most films out there, though, is how it deals with the themes of loss and growing up. Even after getting to know these characters over the course of two films, I was still surprised by just how much I got sucked into their despair. Without giving anything away, there were two scenes that caused me to tear up, and even more that had me on the verge of doing so.Toy Story 3 is not only a worthy conclusion to a fantastic trilogy, but also the one third installment (other than Return of the King) that I feel is better than its predecessors. For all of the reasons already mentioned and more, it's one of the studio's best entries. Sorry for doubting you, Pixar, even if it was just for a bit."
"I wasn't really of a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 though it became a part of my childhood. So after 11 years; and the hype that it gets from my friends, I decided to give this one a try. I came to see it with low expectations. It turned out to be a really, really good movie. Even the short film before it, Day and Night, complemented the movie very well. It was visually amazing. Also, it has a great story. The 'old'characters were still lovable as well as the new ones. Barbie and Ken were great addition to the series. Big Baby was a bit scary though. Many scenes made the crowd inside the cinema laugh real hard but there were also those scenes that silence covered the entire room and sobs were the only sound that can be heard. The ending is very sad. It's so sad that it really had me crying on my seat. Just imagine, I'm an 18 yr old college guy and it had me crying like a baby. Well, it didn't embarrass me at all because when I turned around, people were crying too. So it turned out that I'm not the only one. That scene was just so perfect, with the right timing of music and the proper execution of emotions on the characters' faces, it's just so right. So for the last installment of, I must say, the well loved series, it is indeed the best. With the right amount of laughter, thrill, and tears, it is totally an emotional roller coaster ride. :)"
"I waited a few days to review TOY STORY 3 as I was profoundly moved and wanted my feelings to subside a bit. I was puzzled as to why a 50 year old man would feel emotional about a kids movie (and a third installment to boot). I have a 11 year old son who LOVED the Toy Story characters, yet during the movie; even at the end he was far more composed then his old man. TOY STORY 3 is a wonderful film. Read the other reviews for plot descriptions and more superlatives as I agree with them all. For us folks with kids I can tell you I believe the root cause why you maybe so moved to tears as I was. Through our children we learned about and grew to care about these characters. They represent our children's early childhood; a time for joy and wonders. Now our children are growing into teenagers and we collectively weep for those days not long ago we could marvel at how our children would drag around a Tattered Woody or hold up a Buzz Lightyear and exclaim ""To infinity and beyond!"". If your children ever pulled you through Disneyland and waited in line to stand with Woody and Jesse, get a photo and maybe even an autograph, this film will so remind of those lost days that well....lets just say bring tissue and thank god for the 3 D glasses as you don't want anyone to see you crying over what my son says ""Is a cool movie...for little kids""."
"without a doubt the best movie of year and decade, this movie made toy story 1 and 2 look like shrek the third, yea its that good! me and my girlfriend went to go see this at the premiere and we both cried like babies. I grew up to toy story, i grew up with andy, and its really unbelievable how pixar can flow the emotions from sad to funny without ruining any beautiful moments 10/10. I predict a Multi- Oscar Winner here! If you want to cry go see toy story 3 and skip jonah hex and karate kid and A team! P: i hope this is not the end of toy story if it is i will DIE, btw, barbie and ken made me burst out laugh the whole entire time!!"
"By now, it's become a cliché to say ""Pixar has done it again."" But that doesn't make it any less true.Year after year, Pixar releases movies that leave audience's jaws on the floor. Toy Story 3 is no exception. With 15 years' worth of personal investment in the series, Pixar has crafted their most emotional outing yet. We've grown up with these characters (I was 5 when the first one came out, and as Andy heads off to college, I'm just home from my first year), so there's already a built-in connection. We care what happens to these toys. It's a world we're all familiar with: not just because the films have been around for a decade and a half, but because everyone has had toys and (probably) grown out of them. It's an interesting reflection of our reality, because as we flinch when Andy calls his toys ""junk,"" we know that we've done the same.I cried. A lot. On the way home, I cried some more. Pixar has done a simply beautiful job of finishing this series. It's always been fun to see the way the toys handle different aspects of life that are stressful for them: birthday parties, Christmas, yard sales. But having their owner grow up and leave them is something totally different. While many of the toys resign to their fate or even embrace the possibility of going to daycare, Woody's unflinching loyalty reminds us of why we love these characters so much in the first place. And these reasons are reiterated to great effect in the final, amazingly written and executed scene.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Toy Story 3 is the way all the different elements are blended so seamlessly. There's heart to spare, hilarious comedy, clever writing, and intense action sequences. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was so stressed out watching a movie. These toys have to run the gauntlet on their adventure, and it makes the ""no toy left behind"" policy even more affecting.Genre lines are blurred, as well. The opening is an appropriate western/sci-fi mix that hearkens back to the first film. A large portion of the film takes on the characteristics of a prison break film to thrilling effect. Each generic evolution feels natural, making the movie increasingly complex and thus, the perfection with which it's pulled off that much more impressive.As with all of Pixar's films, the technical aspects are dazzling. The animation is simply beautiful, especially the texturing that's achieved on some of the softer characters, like Lotso. The 3-D is well-implemented and utterly unintrusive. There are no gimmicks here; Pixar doesn't make things pop out of the screen to justify the heightened ticket prices. The film itself is worth the money, and the 3-D just makes everything look that much crisper and more gorgeous.The voice cast is phenomenal as always. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are still the perfect leading pair, and all their support is hilarious. The new additions to the cast are fantastic, as well. Michael Keaton as Ken gets a lot of the films biggest laughs. He captures just the right blend of sinister and clueless, with a healthy dollop of vanity to coat it all. Other new highlights include the wonderful Kristen Schaal and Timothy Dalton in small supporting parts.The series also continues its tradition of great villains in the vein of Sid (who makes a subtle cameo as a garbage man) and the Prospector. This time, we get a terrifying pair in the form of the cute and cuddly Lotso and the horrific, droopy-eyed Big Baby, who recalls the claw- bodied doll head from the first film. The pair make an interesting team and are given a backstory that makes them more sympathetic than most film villains. Their flashback is reminiscent of Jessie's in the second film (although there's no heart-breaking song accompanying it).Randy Newman is back in the music department and delivers an appropriately flexible and exciting score. He also provides a great new song to the Toy Story canon: ""We Belong Together"" (can you think of a better title?), which plays over the credits as fun extra scenes help relieve the emotional load.Simply put, Toy Story goes above and infinitely beyond my highest hopes and expectations. It tugs at the heartstrings in a genuine way. In typical Pixar fashion, there's no emotional trickery being pulled here. Pixar's focus has always been on story, and with their latest masterpiece, they've brought their first story to a beautiful, fitting close. I couldn't be happier."
"I just attended a free screening and, without having seen the ending (it was a ""cliffhanger"" screening), I believe this is the best Toy Story yet. I didn't know if they'd be able to keep the magic going but this story is extremely clever and, as per usual, beautifully animated. From the beginning I found myself happily smiling in my seat. The new characters are funny and support the old cast, some of whom are reinvented in their own ways, wonderfully. This movie had a college crowd laughing hysterically, showing that Disney Pixar movies can truly be for all ages. Although I was afraid the plot would become too stretched by having Andy head off to college it still manages to be very heartfelt. I'll be excitedly going to see the rest of it in June."
"That moment Andy was looking at the toys and said ""Thank you guys"", That was us!
Thank you guys for being a part of our childhood until now that we are grown ups but whenever we look at you we see our childhood.
So Thank You Guys..."
"After 11 years later, we finally get to see another Toy Story movie! Even though it wouldn't be realistic to expect this sequel to be as good as Toy Story 2, you can always believe that Pixar will deliver another entertaining film.It was so refreshing to see all the Toy Story characters again. Surprisingly, the only speaking toy character that was in the first two films that was absent in Toy Story 3 was Bo Peep. Other than her, the rest of Andy's toys have returned and all of them get a good amount of screen time. As for the new toys, Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) & Ken (Michael Keaton) have the largest roles.If there is something negative about this movie is that it lacks originality, but the ending is golden! As for the generic portion of the film; you will notice that the formula for this movie is very similar to Toy Story 2, such as the villain and the toys' rescue mission. As for the conclusion of this movie, it is so good that I hope they do NOT make a 4th film. It feels so fitting to have this movie end the trilogy, as the moral & theme of the story represents the entire Toy Story films.I was surprised at how emotional the final scene was; but then again, Pixar is great at adding the human elements into their stories & characters. As for the main theme song ""You got a Friend in Me"", it's a universal message throughout the entire Toy Story films, to the very last sequence of this movie. As for the moral of the story (including the whole trilogy), it is learning to let go when the time is right; whether you are a toy, a child or a parent. I loved how this film ends! What it lacks in originality, it makes it up entirely in its conclusion."
"The third part of every trilogy usually ruins the series. ""Toy Story 3"" was almost a victim because the plot was suppose to be about ""Buzz having a defect and he was shipped to Taiwan to be fixed but instead he's going to be replace by another Buzz Lightyear, and the other toys will rescue him."" if that's the plot of ""Toy Story 3"" then it will be an unnecessary sequel. But good thing Pixar changed it in to a better plot. Everyone's favorite childhood movie is back to the big screen and it is still the same old Toy Story movie that we always love! Toy Story 3 is one of the best sequels of all time.The reason why other third parts of the trilogy fails because they didn't have a great story. Pixar never made a bad movie yet because they care about the story of their movies. The movie is non-stop entertainment. There are no boring parts. Even the parts with no dialog are so entertaining. The old characters still have their same old personality. The new characters are fun to watch, but too bad Mr. Pricklepants didn't have enough screen time. I liked that character even though he didn't have enough scenes. Randy Newman's music score is a little nostalgic to the first two Toy Story movies.""Toy Story 3"" is darker, suspenseful, exciting, and has more drama than the first two movies. The movie also has a large scale. This might be the biggest sequel of the year!Poor olé' Dreamworks, they have finally made a classic but still their rival is still going to beat them. So better luck next time DW. Animated Movies this year are overwhelming and a-must-see-to-the-big-screen-than-DVD-and-Blu-ray.You might be asking ""What is the best Toy Story movie?"", the answer is .... All of them! All three Toy Story movies are classics and unforgettable. Sequels doesn't need big action and explosions to be good. It's all about the story. I think Toy Story needs to end here.5/5 stars! Best movie of the year!"
"I've been watching Toy Story as long as I can remember and now its hard to imagine this great trilogy come to an end. Toy Story 3 delivers beyond what we were expecting. It has great comedy, wonderful performances by its all-star cast, probably one of the most emotional stories made by Pixar, and a climax so suspenseful it makes the ending all the more emotional.Toy Story comes from an older generation of films. By now everyone who saw the films when they were younger is grown or just about grown. But it doesn't stop Pixar. Toy Story was one of the first animated films I had ever seen. Then Toy Story 2 came out and that film helped keep me fixated on Toy Story for a long time. Now I'm older, but it doesn't stop me from loving Toy Story and its great sequels. In a way I think its the filmmakers saying goodbye to the older generation of kids who first saw Toy Story and the other great Pixar films and welcoming a new generation. However you look at it there is still an obvious message in the film. And the message is simple but like all Pixar movie messages are they are also smart (especially the way its executed), but I think I'll let you find out what it is on your own.The film is about Andy leaving for college and now the toys are worried about their future. Then one thing leads to another and they end up at Sunnyside (a daycare) where they meet some new toys like the leader Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear and at first they think its great until they learn that they were put in the toddlers playroom. After being tortured by the kids they learn Andy is looking for them so they decide to break out of there. However they learn that Lotso isn't as nice as he seems. So now with time running short before Andy leaves they have to break out and learn what it truly means to be a toy.I found this film to being darker than the previous Toy Story films. In the first film Woody and Buzz are afraid of being alone on the side of the road or being trapped in an evil kids house. In the second one Woody's afraid of being sent to Japan. But in this film the toys are afraid that they're going to die. And the darker element I have to say is great. It helps build for a more suspenseful climax and shows that Lotso is probably one of the most evil and insane villains created by Pixar. Especially since at first he seems nice and lovable but when he shows how cruel he is you know the toys are in trouble. And the darker element got me thinking about Up and Wall-e. Both of those movies were Pixar's move out of their comfort zone. Wall-e being a post-apocalyptic film with a message about the future of the world if people don't change and Up taking on serious elements like marriage, life, death, and learning to let go. And now Toy Story 3 does something different as well, it has a much darker tone for a Pixar film which really works. There might be a couple scenes where younger kids might be scared but nothing that should terrify them beyond the point of seeing this film.And a little warning, this film is a tearjerker. The end practically had me tearing up and a couple times I felt a tear run down my cheek and I could see it in the faces of the rest of the audience as well. The film is meant to be bitter sweet. Because of that tears are pretty much guaranteed.This film brings back some of the most beloved characters in film-making history and even brings back its audience from more than a decade ago. There are so many memories in the Toy Story films anyone who loved them when they were a kid can't help but see this film and shed a few tears for their old childhood friends. And who can blame them (including me) for doing so, Pixar has proved time and time again that animated films are for more than just children and that the emotional aspects of the films can even be better than some of the best live action dramas that have ensured tears from their audience.My love for animation has proved to live on again in the new Toy Story film. Ladies and gentlemen what we have here is sure to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Film this year. I thought it wasn't possible but my high expectations were met when I saw Toy Story 3. It has beautiful animation, loving characters, a great and emotional story, and a finale fit for the toys who have enchanted our lives for more than a decade. Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story from the trilogy and is yet another Pixar masterpiece."
"I saw the cliffhanger version at my college yesterday and I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed by it! Pixar knows how to keep the story fresh, and entertaining. They kept the entire crowd laughing every other moment, and mixing in gasps of fear whenever anything happened to the main characters. The visual effects are simply stunning, like nothing you've ever seen before, with lots of great cinematography. Even though we didn't get to see the end, they still gave us enough of the story to make it very satisfying. There are plenty of classic Pixar references so keep your eyes peeled for those. I will definitely be at theaters on June 18 to find out how this amazing saga will end!"
"I know, I know... I'm sure I'm going to get destroyed over this review. Anything under eight stars for a Pixar movie is blasphemy! While I thought TS3 was an entertaining two hours... it just wasn't quite up to par with the first two entries from the trilogy.The opening and ending dealing with Andy growing up and the toys outliving their usefulness to their owner was well done Pixar heartstring tugging... no complaints there. The middle act, which boiled down to a prison break movie, was a bit dull despite all the Pixar eye-candy trying to convince me otherwise. There were some gags to be had, a funny turn by Potato Head needing to use real vegetables, some thin and obvious (but still humorous) banter between Barbie and Ken and the now required shtick of Buzz Lightyear getting reset to various memory-wiped settings... but in general the middle 60 minutes of the film just seemed oddly disconnected from the rest. The end result was an odd sandwich effect, with the bread on either end actually being much more enjoyable then the meat in the middle.While I'm certainly not trying to slag the movie, I don't think 7/10 is anything approaching a hatchet job, I found this one to be clearly a level below the two films that preceded it. Pixar didn't waste the magic they built up with TS1 / TS2... but they certainly didn't expand on it either."
"I am a 21 year old male. I watched the first Toy Story in theaters when I was 7 years old and the second Toy Story when I was 11. These films are a part of my childhood and I can assure you anyone between the ages of 18-30 have a special connection like I do for them. I personally have been waiting for this movie for 10 years now, since the ending sequences in Toy Story 2. Ten long years later, I finally received my wish.Toy Story 3 is the story of our classic and new favorite characters Woody, Buzz, Slinky, Ham, Rex and friends as they try to cope with the fact that Andy is going off to college. They haven't been played with in years and they're becoming restless. As much as they want to believe Andy will save them and keep them in the attic as Woody predicts, our beloved toys start to question his motives as college day is coming and Andy's old room is starting to deteriorate into a trash hold. Which will Andy decide upon? The plot for this movie at first glance made me very satisfied, seeing as Pixar and the writers are trying to follow the time frame we are accustomed to. Back in 1999 when Andy found his new toys Jesse and Bullseye, he was still a child with imagination and joy to play with these toys. Ten years later, he is no longer a child but grown into a graduating senior who is ready to venture off the college for the first time. This plot is a classic scenario that new-bound college teens deal with on their moving date: whether or not to give up hold on our childish bonds. It's time to grow up sometime. This plot grabbed me in easily.As the rest of the movie continued, Pixar led us on a classic Toy Story adventure, much like the opening scene in Toy Story where the Army men move downstairs to find what Andy receives in his birthday presents, or the scene in Toy Story 2 where the gang try to manage their way to the toy store across the highway. These very simple and drawn out scenes are what grab our attention because of the detail with every move, every instant that our friends are in peril. They also help a child who is watching to use their mind to follow along, from one frame to another, as Woody jumps from floor to toilet seat to toilet paper roll and nearly falls creating applause, up to the stall to the ledge and out the window for freedom. These actions take a lot from a child to stay along, which helps develop brain activity in problem solving. Step 1 to Step 6 leads to success, and this is a positive attribute to teach to our children.This movie is a little longer than most child films, close to 2 hours, which is a perfectly acceptable time frame for a movie so anticipated. Having it be under 90 minutes would have been a little selfish for the animators seeing as they knew how long we waited for this. If you are seeing this in 3D (which I believe is a must) you will be drawn in very easily and your attention will be kept throughout. With introductions of new characters and vigorous imagery, it is hard to lose track of what's going on. The animation was flawless as usual, storyline close to perfection, characters are lovable... I truly see no reason to dislike this film.Overall I gave it an 8 out of 10. This movie lives up to the first 2 in the series, not so sure about being better than the original. Close but undecided. You can make your own judgment call. If you are between the ages of 18-30 or you have children of your own, this film is one of the better ones you will see all year. Be a kid again, it won't hurt for 2 hours."
"A decade after the second film comes Toy Story 3 which I found exciting as well as heartbreaking.Just by reading the plot, I know this movie will be too emotional since I'm going to college like Andy and like him I pretty much outgrown my toys and never played with them.What if toys have feelings? We don't know, but TS3 creates this simple idea into a massive hit. First off, the characters, they are so well done, from animation to characterization. No one is missed out.Now Andy is 17 and he's off to college, the toys are faced with a very hard situation, Andy is leaving, what will be left of them? Feeling they are being outgrown by Andy, the toys planned many things to get noticed i.e. they stole his phone, puts it into the toy box where they are then calls it but no avail. Mishaps ensues when they are all mistaken as a garbage headed into the dump, the toys realized that they are not significant for Andy except for Woody and decides to go into the SunnySide Daycare.SunnySide is a perfect place, they will be never forgotten, there are nonstop supply of kids that will play with them. Lotso, a fluffy, cute, pink bear is the leader of the SunnySide, he's a wolf on a sheep's clothing. The new characters are a great surprise, we got Lotso, Ken, Buttercup, Trixie and much much more. The appearances and disappearances of characters were quite good, this film tends to focus on the principal characters more thus removing Bo Peep, Wheezy and the other toys into the story, which I found amusing and heartbreaking since the toys on Andy's room decreased terribly.As the characters realized Andy's searching for them they plan an escape after Lotso and his troop imprisons them. It's a series of mishaps, solidarity and nonstop emotion as we follow our characters back into their lovable owner.Story is quite good, simple but priceless, this is just not a movie about toys, it's about the relationship with it's owners. I loved how the toys feels so nurtured by Andy that they will do anything to get back to him, even though it will take their life, especially on the incinerator scene which got me into tears, I felt a sudden wave of loneliness when the toys gave up and hold each hands where a large fire is in front of them and I will not gave away what happened after this but they got saved.The last part of the movie is where it really got me, Andy's passing of torch to a little girl named Bonnie. Here, we see Andy flinch for giving Woody away, the line ""He'll never give up on you"" is so heartwarming, we can see in Woody face (even though he's in freeze) that he's choking into tears.Andy driving away is the greatest shot of the movie, below we see his toys staring at him as he gets away, it's so bittersweet, it just doesn't tug a string in my heart but punched a big hole out of it. Woody and the gang is not maybe mine but Pixar made me feel they were, this movie is a big part of my childhood, as the credits roll you will realized this is the ending of your childhood and you have to move on... as what the toys and Andy did.Toy Story 3 is breathtaking, guaranteed to make you cry or laugh from start to finish."
"I walked into this movie with high expectations, and this is usually a mistake. Not with TS3 it wasn't. Toy Story 3 was incredible, to put it in one word. Who would have known I would cry the most in Toy Story 3, more than I did in Any.Other.Movie -animation or not. It was just THAT engaging. It took me back to my childhood, and made me yearn for my Supermen models. It was very ""realistic"", which I know is an unusual way of describing an animation movie about living toys, but that's what it was. Incredible story, music, moments... everything. Watch it in IMAX 3D, it's totally worth it. This is movie making at its finest. Thank you, Pixar. Thank you."
"The year that I was born, was the year that the first Toy Story came out. Ever since I saw the first one, I've loved the series. Now fourteen years later (almost fifteen) I dragged my mom to a midnight showing of it in Branson. I loved the movie! The characters are amazing, the graphics are the best in the world, and I don't think I could've asked for more.My younger cousin has only recently watched the other two Toy Stories. When she asked if I could take her to the movies to see the new one -even after I've seen it seven times already- I had to say yes.I knew that I loved the series and now my cousin does too.The bottom line is is that I adore the film, and will totally buy it when it comes out on DVD. If Pixar and Disney keep making movies like this, they will be around forever!"
"This is now officially one of the most qualitative franchises I can think of, and a Toy Story 4 of even half the quality would send this right to the top past the Alien Quadrilogy. The storytelling is brisk, the animation is beautiful, the scenes range from funny to disturbing to terrifying to heartwarming to outright tear-inducing. The garbage combustion scene alone is bound to give children nightmares, but Buzz bustin' out the flamenco is more than enough to keep this one fun for the whole family. What I like best is that they manage to keep to the spirit, look, and characters of the other movies while still amping up showmanship and surprises, storytelling and subthemes.That said, this movie follows the same essentail formula as Toy Story 2, including having a roughly similar turn-out for the villain of the picture, and the ending pretty much sets us back at point one so that this can just continue on and on. These movies are, essentially, all about limited time and limited life, these characters all know one day the end will come, but of course the audience knows that it won't, at least during the movie that they're watching. So even though I trust Pixar enough to go to see Toy Story 4, if it ever exists, right here would be a very good place to end. After all, the first is about surviving replacement, the second about surviving aging, and the third about surviving the afterlife (I would say that the daycare center stands in for Purgatory and, well, the inferno for Inferno quite well), so any more existential worries about the end of the toys given time would probably be repetitive--best to start thinking about other adventures they could possibly go on, or settling on the score while it's still high.--PolarisDiB"
"This is, without a doubt, the best film of the year. Don't get me wrong, How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent film as well. But Pixar have managed to become the animated equivalent of The Lord of the Rings: a trilogy in which all three films are awesome in their own right.In this film, Andy is going to college, and Woody's (Tom Hanks) not happy. But through a series of mistakes, the gang end up at a daycare center, where they meet Lotso (Ned Beatty), a cuddly teddy bear. But they soon realise that it wasn't what they thought it was going to be.The film has incredible callbacks to previous films, hilarious moments, and one very touching ending. Pixar have continued to provide epic film after epic film, but this will be their very best, along side the second Toy Story."
toy story 3 was an awesome movie. i loved it it was a bitter sweet story at the end. when i was little i loved toy story then i was hoping for another and in 1999 Pixar did it! then i thought there could be another but i lost hope for it. 11 years later i found out and was ready to see it. i loved it tied in with the whole story. and had more action than the first two! nothing negative to say it was the best. the end was sad but yet happy. how Andy played with his toys one last time. and how he knew his toys were alive. 10 stars! loved it. this is for sure the final toy story. great ending. they closed the movie just right. like i said bitter sweet.
"I watched Toy Story 3 on its midnight premiere. It was great to have the crowd behind the characters, but also the story was really fun and emotional. It also helped that I have grown up with these characters (literally) the first one came out around the same time I was Andy's age and 1999- toy story 2 was 8. Now 10 years later the character Andy and I are both graduating, I always thought that was cool that pixar progressed his age, sorry for digressing. But anyways this movie is amazing, it breaks all the flaws of a second sequel a complete rarity. First most all the characters and voice overs come back except for slinky who sadly passed away but his friend voiced this one but its spot on, also there is explanation as to the whereabouts of the other toys that we do not see, bo beep, etch a sketch, and squeak. Leaving no apparent plot wholes. The story also progresses at a good pace, and makes you feel like a kid again, rooting for the characters every step of the way, it makes you hope that at the time of the movie your old toys are conversing waiting for you to play with them. Very nostalgic in that sense, I don't think at all that this was just a venture for Pixar to make more money, because the movie it so great! oh and all you Miyazaki fans, TOTORO has a cameo*!!!! Fantastic movie!"
"Pixar never ceases to amaze me. The Toy story franchise was destined for greatness from the beginning, and this third installment in the series lives up to its predecessors.I went into the theater with high expectations and hopes that it would be what I believed. My hopes were exceeded in the first few minutes of the film as my emotions were taken on a ride of crests and troughs throughout the entire experience.Not only that, but Pixar somehow managed to slip brand new characters into the plot so seamlessly that if you had never seen the two previous movies, you would have guessed that they had been around for the whole trilogy. I was in shock to see the third movie in a series perform better than any threequel I've ever seen. It even rivals the first two.If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend that you do. All ages are allowed at this cinematic occasion and all ages can enjoy it."
"You should by all means see this film--it is quite enjoyable and Pixar should be proud. And, a week after its debut, the film has earned $2138123413713471035 dollars (more or less)--so it's obviously a huge hit. And, I did enjoy the film....BUT. There's that nagging 'but'...a certain odd something that I felt was lacking in the film. Personally, I STILL prefer ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Up"". I also am a bit concerned whether this is the best film for the youngest members of the audience.Technically speaking, this is probably the best looking CG movie made to this point--though I am sure in the next few years they'll manage to exceed this one--that's the nature of things. There are so many scenes where you just marvel at all the elements--there is just so much to see and your eyes just delight in this. One of the examples are the amazing daycare scenes--with so many toys, kids and knick-knacks about the rooms, you can't believe the Pixar folks could do it! The other is is the scene at Bonnie's yard at the end of the film--the colors, textures and depth were just mind-blowing. It was first-rate in just about every way technically, though the 3-D aspects were very good but not great. Yes, they looked nice but they weren't 100% necessary to the film and didn't seem to use e 3-D to its fullest (like they did in ""How To Train Your Dragon""--a film that did manage to use the 3-D as more than just a nice novelty).As for the plot, I really don't want to recapitulate what's in the film. There have already been a ton of IMDb reviews that have done a very good job of detailing the plot. Instead, let's talk about I think this was actually a bit weak. Sure, the old characters were mostly back and I loved a few of the new ones (Ken was great), but the film had a dark and slightly unsavory element to it that bothered me. A lot of families would naturally bring kids to see it--kids too young not to be terrified. While another recent CG movie was terrifying (""Coraline""), as least it was not rated G and did not have the family-friendly aura about it. In this films, the problems were not like they were in ""Toy Story 2""--whether or not the toys could make it home. Here in ""3"", they not only struggled with this but also were often in jeopardy of being completely destroyed--either shredded or incinerated!! Also, while they didn't bother me at all, a couple of the new characters were downright creepy--such as the baby and the crazed monkey! Yikes--imagining a 3 or 4 year-old seeing this makes my skin crawl! Aside from these concerns, I have to hand it to the film. It was highly manipulative and will make you shed a tear--even if they are only toys! And, it certainly was lovely--real eye-candy!UPDATE: This film just won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. In addition, it's now #31 on IMDb's Top 250. Considering it's a sequel, I just don't get this...."
"Those guys at Pixar know how to tell a story! These characters will live in our hearts forever! They really know how to tug at our hearts.This is more ramblings about the movie then a review.There are so many movies that can't get me emotionally involved, movies in which I don't care at all about the people whom I'm supposed to be rooting for.But Pixar knows how to get me. And it's not just a rooting interest, it's a love for characters, a love that hurts. I know I'm not the only one who's fallen in love in Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Up and most of all in the Toy Story movies.It's been so long since the first one that the special effects don't distract me in awe of them. The first two movies were so good that the story kept you from being distracted, but I couldn't help but stop and look at how beautiful the animation was. But now that I'm used to it, I was able to just watch the movie.The first half of the movie wasn't that great. It seemed like rehashed themes from the first two, but the second half of that movie made up for it and much more.The key to the puzzle of this movie, for me, as a father, was that moment when the mother sees Andy's room empty and realizes that her baby has grown up and he's moving away. That moment captured that whole movie's spirit.It was time to let go and say goodbye.Thank you Pixar. I watched 'The Pixar Story' on the Disney Channel this week and after watching Toy Story 3 it makes me so grateful for them. They tell great stories, they make great movies.Please forgive my spelling and grammar. I am a product of the Miami-Dade Public School System."
"This movie really has it all - belly-laughs, wonderful animation, sly observation - the list goes on. But it's also extremely frightening in places and I wouldn't want to be the mother of a five year old during - or for several years after - taking it to see this film! There is a real air of threat hanging over our trusty Toys for much of the film, and some genuinely dark and scary villains. Of course, children's films have long been peopled by menacing characters - the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Cruella Deville etc - but the baddies in Toy Story 3 have less of the cartoon and more of the nightmare about them, and I found them quite chilling.It's also a bit of a tear-jerker on several levels - for adults as well as children! - and if you take children to this one, expect to deal with the fallout of tears and fears for a while afterwards! Also, the movie's 3D version is a big waste of money. The most noticeable thing in 3D was the subtitles, and I wouldn't waste my money on the extra expense of a 3D experience on this one.Despite all the dire warnings above though, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It was more emotionally involving than any live-action film I've seen this year. It's a very long time since I actually GASPED in a movie! Toy Story 3 is a winner all the way."
"For 16 years the Toy Story franchise has captivated a whole sleuth of generations with two amazing films. In almost two decades, there have been millions of kids rushing back from their schools or quickly opening their bedroom doors after they are gone to double check that their toys are not alive. Toy Story has stood the test of time and has become one of the greatest children films of all time and spurned a fantastic sequel. But how do you top that? Can Toy Story 3 make this one of the most brilliant trilogies? Toy Story 3 sets off 11 years after Toy Story 2 with Andy, Woody and Buzz's owner, all grown up and heading for college. The Toy's fate lies in his hands; trash, attic or donated? After a series of bumbling mistakes, the Toys wind up heading for the seemingly perfect Day-care centre, Sunnyside. Sunnyside is ruled by the lovable bear Lots-o. However, all is not what they seem and the toys suffer a terrifying play time with children way below the appropriate age. What seems like a dream quickly turns into a nightmare for the toys as they head the great escape. Pixar, by now, has learnt each trick into hooking the adults as well as the children and not by turning to subtle dirty humour. What is so wonderful about Toy Story 3 is the experience of childhood that you remember or you are living right now. While we are introduced to so many new characters each one comes with its own quirk that is easily lovable and easily memorable. The quick fire lines don't just appeal to every age; it makes them laugh and chortle. Ken, the doll who has never met a Barbie, is a wonderful inclusion to the Toy Story cast with his vanity, self image but also having a big heart. The villain, without giving anything away, is also reminiscent of Sid and Stinky Pete of the previous films. Not only this but the action is every bit edge of your seat entertainment that left the audience gasping and jumping at every moment. I, for one, will never look at a baby doll in the same way.The most triumphant part of this piece of cinema is how your heartstrings are tugged in each and every way. From the opening sequence to the credits, I have not wept so much in a movie since Up; another Pixar classic. The story and the sadness is told so beautifully that it probably made a few people think twice about throwing away old toys or replacing those who are lost. I'm not saying that Toy Story 3 is without flaws. There are times watching where you feel like you had seen it all before with it's predecessors and at some parts the film does becomes predictable. But that is where the classic Pixar genius enters giving enough twists to keep you hooked on till the end. The Toy Store elite films are delightful and to dismiss them as children's films would be an outrage. I found more shock, love, terror, comedy and intrigue that most ""art"" and ""sophisticated"" films are missing. The greatest trilogy of all time? It would be foolish for me to say. But this is definitely up in the big leagues and will last from infinity and beyond."
"I've decided to watch toy story 3 because i was a fan of the previous two toy stories and I thought those were really well done and had great stories. Toy Story 3 proves that the third film of a series does not have to be the weakest and that it can sometimes even be the strongest. Toy Story 3 is just as magical as the first two offerings and the quality of the animation is second to none. Now I don't necessarily remember exactly what happens in the previous two toy stories but I remember liking them a lot and how the stories were great. I feel that Toy Story 3 is the best out of the 3. Toy Story was great but the third one does it the best, in my opinion.All the same toys are back but this time their are new toys (some good, some bad). Unlike the previous toy stories, this one is filled with more frightening scenes and more mature themes. This one is also more darker and some scenes can scare little kids slightly, but that's what makes it great. I was surprised that their were some scenes like that, after reading some comments from critics and reviews. This movie isn't really for young children but it all depends on their views. The finals scene was a great way to end the series and movie Overall Toy Story 3 is a fantastic film filled with magic moments, strong characters and visuals that only Pixar can produce. Amazing job"
"If 1999's Toy Story 2 presented to Pixar the novelty of creating its first sequel, and an opportunity to both extend a world and expand upon characters already familiar to us, its follow-up brings to a fitting close the narrative cycle first begun in 1995.Each of the Toy Story films have dealt with an established order, of sorts, which is abruptly upset or invaded. The first film saw Woody, a toy cowboy, having to deal with and overcome personal jealousy of new addition and possible favourite, spaceman Buzz Lightyear; the second film, fresh from the resolution of the first, has Buzz and the rest of the gang embark upon the dangerous mission to rescue their cowboy leader from an opportunistic collector; now, the third instalment's central narrative premise is altogether more grave: the toys, excluding Woody, are to be abandoned by their owner Andy, who has now outgrown them and is about to leave home for college.The dilemma is immediately existential, and perhaps marks Toy Story 3 as Pixar's most overtly adult film yet. Here we have a gang of characters requiring no introduction, whose history and evolution are already known to us, and the entire concept of their newest adventure is openly traumatic: the long-deferred reality of rejection – not only rejection, but an entire loss of purpose.If mortality is writ large here, though, it's in quotation marks. As in Pixar's other statement of enviro-happy conscientiousness WALL·E (2008), there's a strong case for preservation and recycling here. Just as the first film had Andy accept both his new hi-tech astronaut and his dustier ranchman, here the toys' initial dismay at being deemed outmoded is replaced by joyous anticipation that they are to be donated to a local daycare centre where they will be played with again – for the first time in years.From here, the plot splits in two. Woody, Andy's sole selection for the trip to college, finds himself wrongly placed in the donation box with the rest of the gang and vows to make the trip back to his lifelong residence at all costs; the others, meanwhile, are happy to have found themselves in a daycare that looks infinitely more promising than the horror stories suggested.That early promise is quickly thwarted. There's a delightful moment when Buzz notices all too late that the toys' collective excitement is in deep contrast to the other daycare veterans, who are hiding themselves away on, beneath and behind shelves, as a bell rings and riotous children re-enter the play-den to attack anything in sight. As a staccato of ghastly discord sounds relentless alarm, there's a dark, sinister edge to this humour that is magnified by Woody's naivety unfolding elsewhere.There is an obvious self-reflexivity at the centre of the film. Absolutely distraught by the violence they've had to endure on their first day at daycare, Buzz and the gang insist these children are ""too young"" to know how to respect toys of their ilk. It's a statement that quite easily applies to the film itself, the third in what is now a 15-year old trilogy. Indeed, if the second Toy Story film came soon enough after its predecessor for fans to be young enough to remember the original and enjoy the sequel in equal measure, the third is some eleven years in the making, so to speak.In this respect, the film has allowed the Pixar collective to return to their roots if only to mark, perhaps, a more open and accessible confirmation of what many already knew after the brave and subtle excellence of Ratatouille (2007), WALL·E and Up (2009): these are children's films for advertisement purposes only; in all others, there's a sincere artistic seriousness at work.Similarly, perhaps because of our familiarity with this world and its characters (whereas the same strengths in more novel pieces may get overlooked), Toy Story 3 demonstrates why Pixar are at present the leading storytellers in mainstream animation bar none. Not only does the film show the usual fine attention to visual nuance – note the marks of dirt on seasoned daycare vet Lotso – there's a careful and thorough approach to set-piece invention.What should be a fairly obvious part of the film-making process, such as how a shot is framed or when a scene should be cut, seems to be made effortlessly simple by Pixar to the point at which you realise just where a lot of the competition goes wrong. The rhythm and relative brevity with which the toys execute their escape from daycare, for instance, is a delight to watch. Or note the self-damning observations of the toy soldiers who unquestionably accept their early fate as the ""first ones to go"" whenever an ominous trash bag appears. Or the simple but seemingly inherent hilarity of juxtaposing glum clown Mr. Chuckles with a happier memory of himself. Or the quiet satisfaction of Mrs. Potato Head finally being re-acquainted with her lost eye. All three Toy Story films show a relish in such amusing detail and character investment.http://www.idfilm.blogspot.com ||| http://www.idfilm.proboards.com"
"Toy Story 3 is magical movie masterpiece, that has the ability to capture any audience of an age. It's funny, it's clever, it will make you cry with laughter and with tears, and it's also much much darker than the previous two Toy Story films, so expect to be both shocked and surprised!Plot Summary: When Andy leaves for collage his toys believe its a good idea to head for Sunnyside Daycare centre; this is so they can all be played with once again by kids. However the children at the centre turn out to be incredibly rough, and the gang soon release they've made a terrible mistake."
"I was the ripe demographic for the original 'Toy Story' when it came out. I remember seeing it as a kid for the first time and it was a magnificent experience. The animation was of course stellar but the film had heart. In some ways I feel the 3rd entry of this brilliant trilogy is more for me than it is for younger viewers. In many ways it is the perfect conclusion to this story. What I loved about the film was that it acknowledges the journey our characters went on. In many ways I did emotionally invest myself with Buzz and Woody more so than I'd like to admit. I have to hand it to Pixar, their films really deal with classic themes. Sure films like 'Toy Story' and 'Up' look pretty and colorful to kids but they deal with emotions that adults have trouble grasping.The setting of the movie is brilliant and is able to add a lot of great humor. The toys are given an opportunity to go to a Day care center and be played with. They are ecstatic but soon find out that their new home isn't all that it is cracked up to be. Lotso, a stuffed bear, runs the center like a dictator. The lesser toys are left to the mercy of the toddlers. In many ways Lotso is the best villain in the series. He is a toy who was replaced. The character is fleshed out and at times has moments where he is very intimidating, although the punishments are very comical to the viewer. The debate about age approriateness had me in stitches.'Toy Story 3' is about the loss of innocence and the end of childhood. Dark stuff for a Disney film. Our pals Woody and Buzz have laid in a toy box as Andy has grown up with out them. The toys fear their fate, either a trip to the attic or worse the dump. I like the fact that the film begins on a bleak note. We are already given reason to fear this fate. The memories of Toy Story 2's subplot are fresh in our head. Kids are fickle as they turn into teens. Woody is especially in turmoil, his love for Andy is as strong as it ever was. Woody is the personification of that innocence and childhood. The scenes Andy has with Woody are brilliant.Woody is forced with a dilemma, rescue his friends or miss out on Andy taking his next step in life. The finale of the film is one of the most powerful moments in Disney's long history and really ranks up there with some of their best films. The kids may not appreciate it but the adults will be in tears."
"Let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of sequels. Never have been. The idea of squeezing a few more bucks out of people by rehashing a successful title, I find despicable. Even though I am a Pixar fan, I thought ""Toy Story 2"" was their weakest release to-date. But THIS movie, well, this is a work of art on its own right. Calling it a sequel is like saying that ""Wicked"" is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. The love to the characters and the story shines through every scene, and the emotions the movie invokes are genuine: you will laugh, you will cry, and you will sometimes do the two simultaneously. The folks at Pixar continue to amaze me by topping both their CGI abilities and their storytelling abilities each and every time. Here, CGI highlights include clutter, voluminous light and fire effects. (When I watched James Cameron's Avatar I distinctly recall thinking ""well, they've got the water, fabric and skin right. I guess we'll have to wait until Pixar makes a fire movie in order to see realistic CGI flames..."") Clutter we already saw much of in Wall-E, and other stuff (fur, facial expressions, gravity, wind, etc.) that Pixar pioneered in earlier films now take their places in the background, making the world of ""Toy Story 3"" much more real and large than in earlier movies, without upstaging anything.I will not go into the storytelling for fear of spoiling any surprises, but I will say this: it is good. Humor, action, relationships, story, pacing - everything finds its place here, and even though one would rightfully say that parts of the plot have been rehashed from earlier Toy Story movies, Pixar did take (as it always does) some risks with the plot, and these risks paid off: the story comes together better than ever.Pixar returns to its roots here. The movie, tone-wise, is far from Pixar's latest installments, but in this return to the roots Pixar continues to show that it did not lose its mastery in the art of animation storytelling. The CGI, spectacular though it is, does not serve as an excuse for making a ""like live-action only animated"" movie. Every character - from Ken the doll to Slinky Dog - is explored for its graphic/physical potential and how this reflects its own emotionality and its relationship with the other characters. In short: an animator's dream.I had lots of fun watching this movie. It's been a while since I've been able to say that.Two thumbs up from me. I don't know how Pixar does it every time, but the folks there certainly pulled it off yet again, setting a new bar for all others to gawk at and envy."
"At the end of my review of Toy Story 2 (1999), I challenged Pixar to ""convince us (with Toy Story 3)that we have been frozen in carbonite all these years, that we haven't really aged at all."" I am extremely delighted to say that Pixar has done it again. Director Lee Unkrich takes rein and flies the Pixar flag with confidence and conviction. The co-director of Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003), Unkrich finally proves that he has what it takes to be fully in charge of a Pixar picture.Toy Story 3, I would guess, is the last installment of a very remarkable trilogy, which in modern cinema, is perhaps only bettered by Peter Jackson's action-fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003). Its success also breaks the ""curse of the third film"" that has plagued popular series such as Spiderman, The Matrix, Pirates of the Caribbean, and maybe even Shrek. Pixar's eleventh straight box-office hit, Toy Story 3 is the epitome of consistency, not only for the famed animation studio, but for animation cinema as well.If there is a minor blip, Toy Story 3 is the least original in the series. Visually, it is arguably the most creative. But plot-wise, it copies the structure of its direct prequel. An action-packed prologue in which the toy character(s) live out their (or their owner's) fantasy? Check. Meeting of new toys in which one of them appears to be kind but is actually wicked? Check. A flashback sequence that details the fate of a toy? Check. Indiana Jonesque action and adventure in another great escape? Check.Nevertheless, it is still very entertaining to see Woody and co. pick up from where they left off eleven years ago. They have not lost any character trait, nor our love for them diminished over the years. The story goes like this: Andy is all grown up and going to college soon. The toys fear that they will become unwanted and unloved. They are then accidentally donated to a day-care center, to their delight of course, where children could play with them. Their enjoyment turns into horror when they realize that at night, the center becomes a prison controlled by a gang of ""veteran toys"".Toy Story 3 is less funny (dialogue-wise), has less film references, but hits the jackpot with great character interplay, of which the most memorable ones include that of Buzz and Jessie, and Barbie and Ken, most of them of a romantic nature. Many of the action set-pieces are thrilling (and sometimes frightening) including one involving a garbage incinerator in which the fear of death brings a collective sense of identity that has never been exhibited to such a heart-wrenching extent in a Pixar film.Unkrich leaves the very best for the last. The final act is touching, with enough emotional resonance to warm even the coldest heart. The younger viewers in which the film is targeted at may not be old enough to appreciate the nuances. But adults who tag along with them, and children who grew up with Toy Story (many of whom are now slightly older than Andy) will find tears in their eyes as they recollect memories of childhood that now look like a distant afterthought. Suffice to say, Toy Story 3 is a definite shoo-in for one of the top ten films of 2010.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
"Toy Story 3 – Firstly to begin with the animation in this film was the best yet, Pixar have done it yet again. It never ceases to amaze me the realistic animation that is available these days. Now the storyline was about Andy going away to college and deciding what to do with his old toys (Woody, Buzz e.t.c), he decides to put them in the attic. Then accidentally he leaves the bag of toys on the floor. His mum then picks them up thinking that they are trash. They somehow manage to get out of the bag and they end up in a box off to Sunnyside daycare centre. At first the toys think this is great and they are in a safe place. Woody is the only one to say that he believes that Andy didn't want to get rid of them and only wanted them in the attic. By the way Woody had been chosen by Andy to go to college. So then the toys try to escape from Sunnyside, in turn trying to get back to Andy. That is the basic plot. Now this is a great film for say age 3 and up, basically for the whole family. You will love the animation. The characters will capture and break your heart again, and it's just so much damn fun. I loved this film, it bought me back to my childhood, and reminded me how much I loved movies, and when I loved to play with my toys. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. I already strongly recommend the academy to consider it for best picture at the Oscars in February 2011."
"I went to the San Francisco Film Festival screening at Pixar Studios last night not really knowing what to expect. Toy Story has been with us for 15 years now (20, in terms of actual development) and I had a sinking feeling that maybe all the character potential had been used in the first two and this was some shameless plot by Disney to exploit the franchise (""Little Mermaid 2"", anyone?). Well, shame on me for underestimating the capabilities of Pixar, who once again have shown how a small studio in Emeryville is a storytelling powerhouse that leaves the rest of the industry in the dust.Toy Story 3 is the tale of Andy, the toys' owner, going to college and their quest to determine their future - headed between the attic or a daycare center. If you've enjoyed the way the first two films blend character drama with innovative action and humor, this cocktail hits its stride in the third film, which draws on everything we already know about the characters and then adds two new entire sets of toys to the plot. There's a new villain, two very amusing romance sub-plots and a litany of visual gags that push the envelope even further. I'm not allowed to go into any details but the second half of the film is a familiar set piece performed in a completely new way that will forever change your view of certain toys and day care centers.Apart from a level of animation that sets the bar in the industry and an attention to detail that makes you wonder what most ""real"" films actually do in pre-production, the real genius of the third film is to provide a satisfying conclusion that gives every character a completed character arc. About 20 minutes before the end, I was wondering how they would do this since there were some fairly dark moments (similar to those in Wall-E and Up), but naturally they manage to pull it together. There's literally not a single wasted shot, let alone a wasted scene, and the pace quickens throughout to keep the tension mounting.Overall, this is another Pixar classic that easily has enough for both kids and adults (and movie aficionados). It's not difficult to see why each of their movies takes five years to complete - yet despite the technical wizardry, the success of their movies is fundamentally routed in their stories, a fact which most other studios seem to forget these days. As to whether the stage is set for Toy Story 4, I suppose they could always pull it off given the creativity at work here, but I think there was a deliberate attempt to make this the last in the series."
"Anyone wondering what Schindler's List might have looked like if performed by toys need look no further than ""Toy Story 3."" An ugly, dark, joyless movie, ""Toy Story 3"" will frighten children and send adults into therapy.The first ""Toy Story"" was a delight, capped off with a fun and exciting chase sequence, in which Buzz and Woody attempted to catch up to the moving van that held all of their friends. Sure, if they hadn't made it, it would have been sad. But the chase and the movie as a whole was a lot of fun, capped off by some fun Randy Newman songs.""Toy Story 2"" was an even better movie, because it added an interesting ingredient to the soup: An acknowledgment of death. The sequence where Jessie laments how her life lost its meaning when her owner grew up is truly heart breaking. And the final spoken lines of dialogue, referencing Buzz's catch phrase ""To infinity and beyond,"" but placing the phrase in the context of death itself was a masterstroke. Adding these dark elements in select moments elevated the movie into something special.""Toy Story 3"" makes the mistake of taking those select moments and turning them into the WHOLE MOVIE. The stink of death, loss and alienation is as prevalent here as a Beckett play. The story of Lotso's grim rejection by his owner and his subsequent change to a dark, Nazi-like dictator poisons the fun. (What, no up tempo Randy Newman song about that?) And the depiction of Ken as a gay stereotype was offensive, and future generations will squirm at those moments, like they do today over the racist depiction of Asians in ""Breakfast at Tiffanies."" (The Pixar films would never take a black or Jewish toy and make them act in a stereotypical fashion, but I guess gays are fair game.) As with most sequels, character growth is mostly zero. The characters have done all their growing in the earlier segments, and so they spend the movie mostly running around, learning nothing, never growing. Woody comes off as absurdly delusional in his belief that the best thing for him and the others is to sit in a plastic bag in an attic for decades until such time as maybe Andy wants his children to play with them.But life at the daycare center is another form of hell. The film strives to depict the toy's plight as a parody of a prison film, but ends up evoking the holocaust and Nazi concentration camps. The tyranny, torture (yes, torture) and betrayals the toys face in the day care center are dark and awful, but still pale in comparison to the act three climax. Here, we have the pleasure of watching our heroes in a trash compactor, facing an almost certain death in an oven, to be burned alive. Again, one can't help but think of the holocaust and how the victims there were burned in ovens.But it all ends happily. The characters are saved and live happily ever after.Or do they? For a film that shows such craft in its writing and such subtlety in its characterizations, the final fifteen minutes of the film are mind boggling inconsistent with what has come before. It begins with the claw, that rescues its characters, God-like, from their peril. Up until now, God-like interventions had been non-existent. These characters always had the ingenuity to get themselves out of jams, but suddenly not here.In the scenes that follow, Andy suddenly loves his toys. And life at the daycare is a toy utopia. (Remember that the only change is that Lotso is gone. I guess he took all the evil with him when he left.) The final image of the film is the sky, with a series of similar looking clouds. Seem familiar? It's the same clouds as the wallpaper in Andy's room. The characters have found themselves, post-fire, in a happy but manufactured world. Conclusion: They died in the fire and this is heaven. I'm happy for them, because sitting through this movie, I felt like I was in hell."
"Toy Story 3. Stunningly animated. Clever. Funny. Technically innovative....DARK.... I was indeed shocked by how dark this movie was. And it is probably being marketed to little kids which would be shameful since this movie left me feeling tired and down instead of the usual exhilarated experience I have with Pixar films. It is not a little children's movie. No kid under 7 should see it unless they have already been jaded by watching stuff too mature for them. It seems as if the producers were aiming their script at the audience that saw Toy Story 1 when it first came out 12 years ago in theaters. Because it is too perverse for today's children. It is a brilliantly edited and filmed technical achievement which has a lot of laughs, but there is an undercurrent of tragedy, hurt, and despair that runs through the lifeblood of this picture. It is unnecessarily cruel with some of its back-stories and comeuppances. The very ending and end credits are delightful and touching, but they feel like cool water sprinkled on ashes that have burned way too long. Too late... The thing that made the first and especially the second movie so great was the insights into Child/Toy relationships. That made for a touching and beautiful experience amid the fun action. This movie offers no new light on that, but brings the Toy Story trilogy to a fine close at the end. But what an ordeal to get there. I feel Pixar was trying to outdo itself with the effects and action. They could have closed the trilogy off much more simply. Here's where I feel they went too far: 1. Characters who were too perverse. A big baby doll who acts as a bruiser. Would have been great if they gave baby a tough guy voice. That would have been funny. The baby voice made the whole character too perverse. Also the Monkey doll at the security booth was drawn way too creepy. Sid from Toy Story 1 was a great villain. Dark, but not too much. Just right. They wanted to make Sunnyside a bad place and they did it too well.2. Way too much action, and done with a sense of despair. Having the toys in this movie all clasping their hands resigned to being melted in a trash incinerator did not leave me on the edge of my seat. It made me depressed. Lotso breaking the heart necklace, again, much too cruel.3. Why not redeem Lotso? That would have been logical and would have eliminated the scene in the incinerator. Lotso didn't need to have his comeuppance. Toy Story 3 taken on its own terms is a very well made movie and has moments of brilliance, but it is no way a little kids movie and it is a shock when compared to the charm of the first 2. Though still keeping it's high standard for quality, Pixar really let me down on this one."
"Just come back from a preview screening in Auckland, New Zealand. This movie is quite simply perfect. From the opening sequence to the end credits this movie delivers in spades! There is something for everyone - those who have grown up with Toy Story, to those who've never seen the film before.Their really is nothing negative to say, other than don't bother spending the extra to see it in 3D - it offers nothing that you wouldn't have got in 2D, in fact the group I went to see the film with actually all agreed in someway it actually detracted from the enjoyment of the film, but you decide!Anyway, great film and wonderful ending to one history's truly great trilogies. 8.9/10"
