"Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said ""Krissy, stop it!"" and I just said ""But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!"", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.In the Pride Lands, Rafiki, a wise old monkey, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Taking advantage of the cub's naive nature, Simba's scheming uncle Scar, who is very angry because Simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend, Nala, but they go to the graveyard instead. There, the cubs are met by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, 3 hyenas who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. But Scar doesn't give up there, he lures Simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the Pride Lands to avoid punishment. In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar, through his irresponsibility, has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, and face Scar once and for all.I know that still that Beauty and the Beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination, but I don't understand why The Lion King didn't get the same treatment. I adore this film with such a passion, I will always defend it to the high end. I still watch this movie, ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, I still sing, dance, and rehears the lines back and forth. How could you not at least with Hakuna Matata? Timon is my idol, he's so care free, funny, and awesome during his drag hula scene ""Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here, 'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine, on this tasty swine, all you gotta is get in line, are you achin',? For some bacon? He's a big pig. You can be a big pig, too. Oy! Ahhhh!"", best scene ever in film history! OK, not in history, but one of my favorites, it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. If you seriously haven't seen this movie, see it! Who said that animated movies can't be true art? The Lion King is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.10/10"
"This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout."
"Watched the new one, and I think I had a disgusted look on my face the entire time. The music, the visuals, the dialogue, the voice acting, etc. Rewatched this one and remembered why this was my favorite Disney movie growing up. From mufasa's death to the goofy hyenas, to the bond between rafiki, simba and mufasa. The music that everyone knows every word to, and scar's ability to deliver each line perfectly. This movie is magic, the new one seems to tech focused and forgot what made lion king so beloved to begin with, its unfortunate. Hoping the circle of life makes it way around and the end of remakes draws close (see what I did there lol). Until then, lion king from the 90s will stay on my shelf and my kids will watch with me. This new one will never end up in my cart and I wont confuse my kids by watching it either. Thank you 90s Disney for the magic!"
"The Lion King is a great film.  Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++"
"I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever be called classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age. It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar."
"The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10."
"Outstanding animated feature from Disney that sports outstanding songs by Elton John, a compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cub Simba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason for his father's death (of course this is not so). As he grows up, he goes on a journey of love, friendship and discovery which will lead him back to his rightful place in the world. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5."
"I watched the film today and I have come to the conclusion that this Disney film is one classic that will keep on delivering to Disney fans like myself...TLK is a wonderful film with great characters and songs with a powerful message that you can always find your way back no matter how hard the journey...I think The Lion King is one of the best Disney animated films matching with the power of Bambi and Brother Bear.I love how Disney Works hard to deliver the best in Animation,Song,And MagicI do believe that 2006 and many years from now The Lion King will Shine and still Roar with Success...Thank-You Disney For The Lion King"
"Delightful animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures about a naive young lion cub destined for greatness. Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he's groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****"
"This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly."
"This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10"
"Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.My rating: 9/10Rated G for intense thematic elements."
"""The best movie I ever watched in any form or any in language"".No, I am not exaggerating! It is the best movie ever, whether in human form or in animated. I can't find a single flaw in The Lion King (1994). Someone could argue that the story is not original, Disney just twisted it. Someone could also argue that i didn't watch that much of movies to judge ""The Best Ever"" but as I said, this the best movie I ever saw. The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata!"
"this was, and still is,a great movie I love it, and hope that everyone gets to experience it for themselves, I've watched it many times and it is always good no matter how many times you have seen it,the songs are great and so are all the characters and the story is incredible, great for all ages and I really recommend it to anyone who hasn't already watched it."
"Ah...""The Lion King."" There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is ""The Lion King"" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. ""The Lion King"" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though ""The Morning Report"" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. ""The Lion King"" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. ""The Lion King"" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! ""The Lion King"" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.A timeless film!"
"I think think this film is excellent and nothing can ever relate to it. I will love this movie my whole life i know i will!! Its great :) The music, the sounds, the characters,the whole movie is great. Its definitely great for kids and it always will be this movie will never grow old. People will still like it when they are 60+. I bet there are people sixty and over who do love this movie.. I am glad that i grew up with this movie its great and i just have to say fare play to the directer i love it!!! I am happy i found this sight i think it is great it give the public a chance to see how there favorite movie is rated by people all over the world. And i think it is excellent the public is aloud to vote!"
"This isn't just the perfect animated movie, it's a perfect reflection of my own life. As strange as it sounds, when I watch this, I don't just see animated animals on screen, I see my life as well. The first half of the movie appeals to my childhood, it's fun, but when Mufasa dies, it brings back memories of my own life. My father died when I was really young, and just like Simba, it hit me pretty hard. I had trouble accepting responsibility for years and years. I kept running from responsibility, putting off learning to drive and even getting a job.But like the second half of the movie, I learned that one of, if not the most important thing about growing up is accepting responsibility. I'm now in my early 20s and attending college, I also learned how to drive and I have a job as well. I can't think of a better message a film can teach than this. That sometimes bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, but just because you can't prevent it, doesn't mean you can let it control you. You have to move on, and accept responsibility. Don't let the past control you, don't run from it, learn from it. It's a message I try to live by everyday. Everything about this movie is perfect, it's one of the very few movies I would call ""flawless"". The characters are great, all of the songs are fantastic, the animation is timeless, it literally hasn't aged a day since it came out.There isn't a single negative thing I can say about this masterpiece. It makes me want to be a better person, it keeps reminding me to be responsible, it's funny, beautiful, dark, it is everything I want in an animated movie. There is nothing more I can ask of an animated movie than this. The greatest animated movie I have ever seen, and well deserving of being in my Top 10."
"I first saw The Lion King in 1994, when I was 8 years old. Ever since then, I have seen it at least 100 times. I have seen it at least that much because I watched it once every week for almost a year and a half.Recently, I became interested in it again, after having seen The Lion King 3 (or 1,5 if you prefer). It kind of surprised me how I was still intrigued and impressed by the whole thing. It was a magical experience that was almost as good as the very first time (I hadn't seen it in years).Everything about The Lion King is so good, that I can watch it over and over again, just like in the old days. The story begins light-hearted and it has a very nice and fun atmosphere. Very stereotypical characters, as always with Disney, but ever so unique in their own way. As the story progresses, it gets very serious, dramatic and sad as well, I actually cried when I saw it the first time (hey, I was 8, give me a break).Then two of the greatest characters in the history of Disney cartoons get introduced. Timon & Pumbaa set a new height considering comedy in cartoons. Again, very stereotypical, but unique in their own way (I loved Lion King 3 because of them).Another thing I absolutely love about this is the awesome music in it. When I was young I didn't pay attention to it as much as I do now, but the music adds so much to the whole movie.It was very obvious, even from just the intro alone, that Disney worked very hard on this masterpiece. I will definitely never forget The Lion King. I still watch it occasionally and I've never been bored.That's another thing I like about this: the songs. Every major Disney picture has a few songs in it and most of the time they are very memorable. It's the same story here, the songs are very memorable and overall just brilliant. ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can't Wait to be King"" will always have a special place in my heart.I knew the entire script of the Dutch dubbed version when I was young, having seen it so many times. Kind of pathetic, I know, but I liked it that much. Still do.The King among Disney Cartoons for me."
"Best animated of all time! That's it, that's the review!"
"That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue."
"Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than ""The Lion King."" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.""The Lion King"" gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, ""The Circle of Life,"" is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.When viewing the film, it is obvious that ""The Lion King"" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in ""The Lion King."" Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. ""The Lion King"" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts (""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, ""The Circle of Life"" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important.""The Lion King"" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to ""The Silence of the Lambs""), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why ""The Lion King"" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.If you haven't already, see ""The Lion King."" You won't be disappointed."
"I being an Animator watched this movie over and over. The quality of animation, movement and voices behind the characters all were so good I have this movie in my collection.This movie was the best animated movie for me in 1994, but still is. The creativity in screenplay, dialog, character development, environment, music, etc. all are masterpieces. This movie is outstanding and exceptional for me."
"The Lion King is not just my favourite animated movie, its one of my favourite movies in its own right. The animation was amazing, and captured the essences of the Savannah brilliantly. The story and plot was one which people of all ages, not just children, could follow and understand, an impressive achievement for an animated movie, one scene in particular wouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, no matter what age the viewer may be, such was its emotional power. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen, particularly James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons, and of course Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who at times were flat out hilarious as Timon and Pumba. The music and songs didn't disrupt the scenes they were in, if anything they added to it, particularly the opening song The Circle Of Life which was the best opening to an animated movie I've seen so far. Some have criticized the portrayal of certain animals like the hyena's and the movie doesn't depict life on the plains accurately, well the correct response to that is, its only a story and it isn't meant to as its not a nature documentary. This is a timeless classic which will never age, the fact that it took twenty years for another animated movie to overtake it as the highest-grossing animated movie is a testament to just how brilliant this movie is. A classic which all the family will enjoy."
"The Lion King is absolutely Disney's greatest achievement to date and will long be hailed as such. The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice. If you aren't among the millions that have purchased the video DO IT (if you can find it anywhere)!"
"this Disney film was probably the most ambitious undertaking by the studio up to that time.the amount of animated sequences are astounding and the detail equally so.so from a technical stand point it's brilliant.and the content of the movie is great as well.the story is wonderful.and unlike many earlier Disney animated movies movies,the villain in this movie is much less evil,and the movie is suitable for most ages.there are a few intense scenes though,and a scene dealing with ***possible minor spoiler***the loss(death)of a character.other than that,though,it should OK for anyone.there are also a fair amount of catchy songs that kids will like,and even the adults might like.for me,The Lion King is a 10/10"
"And here's my spoiler, up front: not only is the young lion's father killed in front of him, he's made to feel it's his own fault. Surely this is even more traumatic than the death of Bambi's mother. And yet, I have to rank this as one of Disney's very best--the color, design, characterizations,and music are all superb. The use of earth tones, so different from Disney's usual bright palette, is stunning and perfect for the story. (And here I want to add that the soundtrack is also excellent--my only quibble being that the powerful ""Circle Of Life"" should have won for best song instead of the pretty but vapid ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"". But that being said, I believe that, like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" should have been nominated as picture of the year. If you haven't seen this, what are waiting for?--arnie113_________________________"
"The Lion King is a classic from Disney. I remember going to the movie theater/cinema and watching the film...I was exactly 8 years old. And until now, with 19 years old, the good sensation of watching this movie is the same as that time. My mother even bought me Simba's doll! =)The story takes place in Africa, where Simba, son of Mufasa, is very well protected by his dad.(sometimes with the help of Zazu, a bird that is kind of a counselor of the king Mufasa)Everything goes well, but there is one problem: Scar, Mufasa's brother, is jealous because he is not the king of the jungle, and decides to do a plan to kill Simba and Mufasa. Simba escapes, but Mufasa dies; Scar tells Simba that he is guilty for Mufasa's death,and the terrified Simba runs away, too sad of what happened. Far from his kingdom, Simba meets Pumbaa and Timon, who takes care of him and teaches about Hakuna's Matata philosophy. Everything will be very well for a long time, until Simba meet again his childhood friend Nala ,who tells him about the horrible things Scar is doing in the old Kingdom."
"In 1994, I was 9 years old when my aunt took me to the local cinema to see the ""new animated Disney Film"" called ""The Lion King"" I'm 32 now...In all honesty, the world has changed a lot since -94. In life and in the world we all live in. I wouldn't say that I'm worried about the future.

"Disney's The Lion King capped a highly lucrative 5 years for the House of Mouse, who were, before The Little Mermaid came along in 1989 and turned their fortunes around, in real danger. It seems ridiculous to think that the studio that now routinely make billions of dollars a year with their Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm output, as well as their recent fondness for re-imagining their so-called 'Disney Animated Classics' series in live-action, could have ever been in danger of actually going under. Yet Mermaid made the millions, Beauty and the Beast (1991) won critical adoration, and Aladdin (1992) charmed, and the rest is history.I remember seeing The Lion King in cinemas back in 1994 with my mum, and not being particularly over-awed. I didn't shed a tear when Mufasa was betrayed, nor was I singing the songs to myself in the car ride home. However, it felt like I was the only one, as the film's popularity seemed to increase each year, with home release re- masters, soundtracks and a theatre production jamming every one of my senses, even now, 22 years later. It was because of this, and partially because I'm an old-school (1930's-60's) Disney loyalist, that I shunned The Lion King for all these years. After finally viewing it again, I wish I had a time machine to slap the 10 year old version of myself, as this is about as close to animated perfection as you can get.For anyone who has somehow never seen the film, The Lion King tells the story of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones), a respected and formidable beast who rules over the Pride Lands of Africa. The arrival of his new son and heir, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick), is cause for celebration across the plains, except, that is, for Mufasa's weak and envious brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) and his hyena friends (Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings). When Scar's plan to usurp Mustafa's throne ends in tragedy, Simba flees with guilt and shame, finding unlikely friends in the slow-witted warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and motor-mouthed meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane). As Scar's rule leaves Simba's former homeland a hyena-ridden wasteland, will the would-be king fulfil his destiny and take back his crown?From the enchanting, wordless opening scene in which Simba is shown off to the crowd to the tune of Circle of Life, to the savage, expressionistic climax which sees hero and villain have their final showdown, I felt completely immersed in this world, regardless of the fact that I knew the story back to front. This is Disney at its most thoughtful, magical and hilarious. Perhaps taking a page from Studio Ghibli's environmentally-aware book, the film shows a real respect for the natural world despite anthropomophising its characters and dabbling in pseudo-mysticism. Lane and Sabella shine as Timon and Pumbaa, two of Disney's most beloved comedic side- kicks, who also get to belt out one of their most beloved tunes in Hakuna Matata. I'll most likely never be convinced that Disney will manage to recreate the beauty and warmth of the likes of Dumbo (1940) and Bambi (1942) during their Golden Age, but The Lion King is the closest it's ever come."
"The lion king is by far the best Disney movie ever made The animation was amazing, the characters were amazing, the story was great it was just a excellent movie. The only thing that I found a bit extreme was killing of Mufasa though to be fair I never found it that sad and I'd be lying if I said balled my eyes out as a kid, but overall, It was such a great movie that one scene like that really doesn't screw up the rest of the movie and that was probably the only thing in the entire movie that it would have been OK not to show. I Still lave the lion king to this day and I'm almost 21 years old and from the looks of I will love this movie until the day I die."
I love this movie its very touching even though they are all animals the music scenes were my favorite as well the movie itself had a whole lot of suspense when the father died and his death was blamed on his own son who had nothing at all to do with the tragedy but his sly evil uncle was the one to blame he planned it all but it was very interesting when he thought that Simba was Mufasa and then the fight at the end was thrilling and the way he died was good for him.over all awesome movie!!! Hope they make more movies that will keep people or viewers wanting more. I believe that this is a great family movie to watch together.
"""The Lion King"" is essentially a retelling of ""Hamlet"" set on the Savannah and casted with lions. Simba (Prince Hamlet) is the child of Mufasa (King Hamlet) and Sarabi (Gertrude), the heir apparent of the Savannah. His uncle Scar (Claudius), however, has ambitions for the throne. Aligning himself with a pack of hyenas, Scar succeeds in killing his brother and taking the throne for himself. The Hyenas, unable to kill Simba, chase him into a desert and leave him for dead. He grows up mentored by the meerkat Timon (Rosencrantz) and the warthog Pumba (Guildenstern) until Nala (Ophelia), a childhood friend, finds him and convinces him to return home and take his place as king.Despite abundant opportunities to become a derivative child-friendly adaptation of the Shakespeare play, ""The Lion King"" succeeds as a unique and family-friendly experience. It conveys the emotions of tragic loss and unforgivable betrayal that, while devastating and heartbreaking, are still appropriate for the entire family. Even moreso than Bambi's mother's, Mufasa's death is a heartrenching experience (and I am not above admitting that I cried watching Simba search for his father in the deserted gorge in which he died).The animation is easily the most breathtaking of Disney's 2-D features: brilliantly capturing the majesty of the African Savannah. The Pride Lands are bright and crisp while the elephant graveyard is nightmarishly grim. The landscape upon Simba's return is nothing short of haunting.The film demonstrates an elegant mastery of visual symbolism rare in films produced since the early sixties. The song ""Be Prepared"" contains evocative visual allusions to the Third Reich, aligning Scar's reign with that of Hitler's. Gothic tradition holds that the natural world is a reflection of the social order; as such, the barren Pride Lands, littered with bones and scorched flora, with bent, stunted trees in the foreground reflects the unnatural ascension of Scar to the throne. In a moment of catharsis etched into every child's memory, the post-battle rain washes away the last remnants of Scar's reign, cleansing the Pride Lands and its inhabitants.A host of prominent actors lend their vocal talents to this film, including the James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg. Elton John rounds out the vocal ensemble, lending his voice to a number of Tim Rice's exceptional musical numbers.This is film is a true classic and easy to for all viewers, young and old, to enjoy together. It is a rare person who will not find something to like in it (genuinely funny quips, thrilling musical numbers, well-crafted script, exceptional voice talents). If you get the slightest opportunity to see this film, I recommend that you take it."
"I love Disney always have and probably always will. But The Lion King in many ways stands out from the rest. And it's not just cause the prince is a lion. You feel the pain and hurt and betrayal along with Simba. You learn and grow along with Simba. You love along with Simba. As with most Disney animals their facial expressions say more than words could say and when Timon laughs about the Kings of the past being in the stars, Simba really needs to say nothing at all. It's all there written in his face and they way he carries himself as he leaves. It's almost a coming of age story. As a young cub he had the world at his paws. Then he sees it slip away with the death of his father and being driven out by the hyenas. Only to later on come back and see that Pride Rock is really home and fight for what is rightfully his. Pop some popcorn and sit back, relax and enjoy!"
"Probably what bugs me about The Lion King is the character design of the lions. Basically, everything I find visually engaging about lions is all but left out of the character design. Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin both had far stronger character designs, as indeed did many previous Disney films centring around animals. It would, however, be foolish of me to fish for any other faults that are simply non-existent.The Lion King is a masterpiece. Good story? Check. A royal lion cub who's a bit on the spoiled side sees his world fall apart when his father dies in a wildebeest stampede. Tricked into thinking he was responsible, he flees and adopts a life of ease with the carefree duo Timon and Pumbaa.This is some epic stuff. Though I decided not to include The Lion King in my favourites list of animated movies, my breath is still taken away when Simbaa sees those wildebeest run down into the canyon. That whole scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of cinema I have ever seen. There are real highs and lows here, a quality that most of the old Disney movies sorely lacked (and this coming from a big fan).Another big plus is the music. The soundtrack goes the whole scale. When all is well in Simbaa's life, there is hopeful music echoing of the jungle and the savannah. Then things get darker and the music gets deeper and more epic than anyone who's not heard it can imagine. ""Be Prepared"" is excellent and rightfully scary as the following scene testifies. The stampede score is one of the most ground-shaking pieces of music I have ever heard. When that all gets too much, there's ""Hakuna Matata"", the ultimate anthem for carefree living, to soothe the soul. Personally, Elton John's original version of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (in the end credits) is the stronger of the two presented; I can hardly fight back tears every time I hear it. ""The Circle of Life"" set the tone for how movies should start and not for no reason. The whole audio part of this movie is a complete bullseye.The characters themselves, even if I really dislike most of the designs, are mostly very good. Scar is wickedly ambitious. Rafiki shows that wise characters can also be tremendously funny, and it's not for no reason that Timon and Pumbaa got their own show; they are wonderful. Equally great are the three hyenas. Then of course, there's Sazu (wonderfully voiced by Rowan Atkinson), the unfortunate bird who's the butt of the crown, no matter on which side of the family he's standing.With a stunning climax, soaring music and a roaring (sic), engaging story, The Lion King is a movie that hits every mark it needs right. It hits home with the audience and makes them feel for this world. It may not hit the mark with my aesthetic senses, but to pretend that the movie was lesser because of that would be foolish of me. The Lion King is a masterpiece, on par with the Beauty & the Beast."
"Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. Simba escapes everything and runs far away. He almost dies in the desert but is then rescued by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and Warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) who teach him to adapt to a sort of hippie life of good times and bug eating. Now grown, Simba (Matthew Broderick) has a run in with Nala (Moira Kelly) his childhood friend, while she hunts Pumbaa. They fall in love and she tries to convince him to go back, but he refuses. Later, while in the grasslands, he meets up with the baboon that christened him, Rafiki, and he leads him out to speak with the ghost of his father, who reminds him of who he really is and what he must do. He speeds off back to his kingdom, now degrading under the false king, to reclaim his throne and set peace to Pride Rock.I couldn't give my opinion about this film without explaining the plot, if you'll forgive me. It really is a Disney classic that's unique in so many ways. The scene in which Simba tries to wake his dead father is horribly tragic, but extremely powerful. Disney already did something similar with Bambi, with the implication that the protagonist's mother had been killed. But it had never reached to the extent that the audience saw the death or the dead body of one of the parents. The Lion King is a 100 times more powerful than Bambi. Even though I never cried at that scene, I was always very uncomfortable with it. The script is also really cool and witty and should have been nominated for the 1994 Academy Awards, along with the winner Pulp Fiction."
"I don't remember seeing this movie for the first time. It came out when I was one year old. But I do know that for as long as I can remember this movie has been my favorite movie ever. I have a collection of lion stuffed animals and my favorite animal is to this day the lion. This movie has even impacted how I want to spend my life when I get out of school. Before I found out about the Broadway production of this play, I didn't know anything about theatre, but because The Lion King was made into a Broadway adaptation, I have developed a love for the theatre. While I still haven't fulfilled my dream of seeing the stage adaptation of this movie, I do have a passion for other parts of theatre, both being on stage and off and plan to major in performing arts in college. I fully believe that if it were not for my love of this movie that I would not have this passion today. The movie itself though is, in my opinion, the best Disney movie every. It has a wonderful plot that draws from classic inspirations and has some of the deepest and most motivated characters in the Disney franchise."
"Throughout the early 1990s, Disney animation appeared to be unstoppable. ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" in quick succession had set a new standard for animation. Unfortunately for Disney, ""The Lion King"" would be its last hurrah for a while, or really for good. Pixar would soon pick up the torch, and now Pixar is king of the jungle.But as for ""The Lion King"".......""Beauty and the Beast"" is probably my favorite Disney animated film, but this one is a close second. It's the darkest and most ambitious and it's got superb animation. The song score by Elton John is the weakest in the above-mentioned string of films, but the orchestral score by Hans Zimmer is the best. The film doesn't shy away from the savagery of the natural world, or the difficult emotions surrounding life and death, and for that I applaud it.Grade: A"
It was a great story that I loved as a little kid and still love and watch the movie.It was a lovely animated movie that was a laugh to watch and really gets to my heart.The music was great the chose the best artists for the movie and really brought the story out.Elton john was a great beginning artist to open the movie.This movie deserves a perfect ten out of ten and deserves to to go down as one of the best animated movies of all times and Disney show open this up as one great family film that should stay out for all future generations to watch and enjoy forever.I wish to see this movie even when i am older and watch it with my children and use it to remember my childhood and remember it for as long as i live.
"I first watched this movie when I was about 3. lol, back then I didn't appreciate it, but I now have the video downstairs in my collection. The Lion King has many wonderful, comprehensible morals which are built up right to the very end. Plenty of action, a well designed plot, great animations, (I personally like the songs). It is a very well thought out film, and although it may appear to be for younger audiences, I would still encourage everyone to see it at least twice. This video is basically a biography of a young lion born to a ""royal"" family (the lion being the ""king of beasts"") Symba lives the life that many of us can relate to, curioius when young, and he grows up to be a great and mighty king due to his experiences along the way. Faced, however, by an ""evil uncle"", he must face many hardships along the way, including separation from his family for a long time. All these years of pain, and renewed love of the friendship that he bonds with an unlikely couple of Timone an pumba, This film really touches the viewer on an emotional level.A superb production."
"This is an outstanding work of animation. I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures."
"""The Lion King"" is and will always will be regarded as one of the better Disney movies. And it deserves that!First of all the movie looks visually splendid! The African land scape's are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself.What makes ""The Lion King"" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has. The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments. The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling, unlike earlier made Disney's that mainly focused on only young children. Still there also is plenty to enjoy for the young ones, especially the characters Timon and Pumbaa shall be loved by them.The story is filled with symbolism and reference to mainly the communist regime.The voice cast is good, mainly of course thanks to James Earl Jones who has an amazing good deep voice. Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching.There are some typical Disney songs that are good. Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it. His first and only one but hopefully not his last. Also Tim Rice and Elton John received an Oscar for the song "" Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and were nominated for two other songs from this movie.A must see animated movie with some scene's and songs that you'll not easily forget.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"So...I'm going to try not to be too biased here...I'm going to compose myself the best I can...But, I'm not going to lie, that's going to be really hard seeing as though I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! I know a lot of people say this film is overrated and all that jazz, but LOOK AT THIS FILM and tell me you don't love it too!ANIMATION: Spectacular! This movie looks great! Of course it has an epic, grand quality about it, and the animation really takes it to another level! The stampede scene has got to be one of the biggest scenes ever put to traditional animation!SONGS/MUSIC: This movie brings us the Tim Rice/Elton John team. Even though there's no Alan Menken or Howard Ashman, these songs are still great! They fit the movie's tone, they're not out of place, and they are ALL memorable! This Disney movie has the best soundtrack - there is no Number One hit song from this film - ALL the songs are Number One! I don't just love the songs, but I am in mad love with Hans Zimmer's score! It's beautiful! It tells the story and fits the mood perfectly! The main theme, ""Lea Halalela,"" is fan-frickin-tastic! Gosh, if that theme were a woman, I'd marry her! But the music is what takes us to Africa (which country are we in? I don't know...), and if it weren't for Lebo M's contributions, NO music in this movie would be great!ROMANCE: For as much as I love this movie, I have to admit that this is one of the weak aspects of the film. I love the ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" number; I love the song, and I love looking at the animation. But...why is the song here? Why is this scene here? First of all, it doesn't match the story at all. It feels like the scene takes place because...Disney movies have romance scenes! Secondly, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love. Look at how other Disney films show love: characters are smiling, singing, happy, and would do anything to be with their romantic interest. Here, Simba and Nala are arguing and yelling at each other after the scene. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Nala as she's laying on her back during the song number, look at how she looks at Simba. That says, ""I want you, lion man.""CHARACTERS: I am in love with these characters! Much like the ""Beauty and the Beast"" gang, there's not a person...or animal...in this movie I don't dislike! My two favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: ""Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become."" OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like ""It means you are a baboon, and I am not!"" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki!STORY: I think the story is excellent. I love watching it, I love watching Simba's arc, I think it is brilliant...Though, there's one other problem the movie has that lies in the story. After Mufasa dies and Simba cries over his body, Scar comes and tells him to run away. Question: if they're all alone, why doesn't Scar just kill Simba himself? At first I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be right. First of all, he has Mufasa's blood on his hands. Second of all, he has a violent fight with Simba at the end of the movie. If Scar wants the throne so badly that he puts together an attack against two children, a Nazi team of hyenas, and a wildebeest stampede, I don't think he was above killing a child. The movie could have been over just like that; why didn't he kill Simba? The only reason I can come up with is ""If he killed him, there'd be no movie."" Well, that's weak. If that's the case, then the movie didn't need to happen. We should have gotten a better reason for the following events that took place.CONCLUSION: Despite the two problems I have with the movie, I still adore it! It's epic, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's musical! It is large! It has one of the saddest moments ever in Disney. It is one of the studio's biggest movies for a reason! Find out for yourself in the big Circle of Life! BOOYIKA!"
"The Lion King is acclaimed to be one of the best and if not the best Disney film of all time. Well lets find out. The plot of the movie is about a young cub named Simba and plans on becoming king, but when Simbas evil uncle Scar kills Simbas father Mufasa. Scar tells his hyena henchmen to run Simba out into the jungle and make him never return. Simba makes new friends in the jungle and decides never to return because he rather lives a life with no problems whatsoever. When his childhood friend Nala informs him that Scar has taken over Simba comes back and stops his evil uncle. I personally find the plot very interesting and exiting. It's like you want to know what happens next every moment. Now the moment that everyone remembers and one of Disney's most saddest moment is when Scar lets the stampede out to kill Mufasa. I mean come on haven't we got enough with Bambis Mom! Mufasas death in my opinion is more sad. The main reason is that with Mufasas death there are not any flying birds after it. With Mufasa they keep it silent like if its at a funeral So after watching this film its now clear to me why its called one of the best. In my opinion its not THE best because it does have its flaws here and there./Cough,cough/ Timon and Pumba! Sorry had a couple idiots stuck in my throat. Still, its one of the best, but by a landslide Not the very best."
"This is in my top 3 animation films of all time. I don't think that any animation film before it managed to enter the hearts of both children and adults at once like this one. An ensemble cast with such a gripping tale, great music and superb animation, made this one of the all time greats. The characters are so well flushed out and each scene is so memorable. I cannot stress just how good this film is. Without a doubt the peak of Disney and to this day they have not made anything this original and so influential. The creators gave us such a good villain and great hero's that in my opinion shows that an animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film."
"This may be an unorthodox way to start a review, but hey it's as meaningful as i'll ever be for a review. My lucky number is 14. I was born on August 14th. My birth sign is Leo (Lion), my State Football Team is the Lions, and its been 14 years since i'v seen my favorite movie from my childhood; The Lion King for the first time. And now I had the honor to experience it in the theater. From the moment the black screen faded to the rising sun along on the African Plane, with opening Zulu lyrics playing to Circle of Life, I got chills up my spine and my lips were shaking as they were forming the biggest smile I think i'v ever had. Now of all the films to come out these past years like the final Harry Potter, Avatar, Inception, Super 8, Transformers, etc. I want make this clear; The Lion King was the funnest time i'v ever had at the Movies! I don't even care for it being part of the 3D effect.I wanted to see it in the theater as if it was the opening weekend back in 1994. It's still The Lion King, but in a sentimental way (If your a 90's kid) it makes you completely feel dropped back into your seat like it's was the first time viewing it. The story of a young lion prince, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick) framed into killing his father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) by his evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Then flees from his past and meets Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumba (Ernie Sabella) whom teach him ""Hakuna Matata"" (Literally meaning No Worries). And in the end Simba returns to be the one true king. The story may be considered Hamlet with lions, but it's so much more than that. Most in part of the fun characters, humor, and still having the true drama and emotion that makes The Lion King what it is. The 3D added depth to the film and actually didn't give me a headache. Zazu flying overhead Pride Rock, the music sequences, and the stampede scene are better than ever, yet I'm sure the new generation seeing it will probably be emotionally scarred for life. I don't want to be a ""Lion King is the Best Disney Movie Ever"" Guy without mentioning it has a flaw. Which is its quick resolve with the last 40 minutes of the movie. Yeah, Simba is intervened by his old childhood friend Nala and crazy shaman blue butt monkey Rafiki to go back home from his 'time away from home' that almost feels like the 10 second log scene in Hakuna Matata. In any way it still doesn't turn you away. Then add the key ingredient to a classic Disney Movie; Songs! Just another element that adds to the formula. Elton John and Tim Rice won an Oscar for their work on this film! And who's to say they don't deserve it? Circle of Life, Just Can't Wait to be King, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and even Timons Hula Song! It took every bone in my body not to sing in the theater but hey, now there's another reason for multiple viewings. I want to say to those who are curious, there is no ""Morning Report"" song in the film! Disneys Classic 2D Animated films are true Disney.Disney mixed meaningful and powerful themes with maximum entertainment in a perfect way that are what make true classics. Today any critic from the New York Times can slap a comment on a movie saying it's a ""classic"" when really they can't say in 10 years people will be talking about it. But hey, Hakuna Matata! In the end if you want a luxury of seeing (Arguably) Disneys best film on the big screen than don't hold back. It will really make you feel like a kid for an hour and a half, and also give you witness to Disneys most beautiful masterpiece that isn't just Dinsey's Best, but possibly one of the greatest achievements ever made.....The Lion King!"
"This is one of the best movies of all time. Not just in terms of animated movies, but ALL movies ever made.One of the last films in Disney's 10-year era of blockbusters and critically acclaimed films.Magnificently animated with incredibly well-composed music. It is more an art than a movie.This film has everything, Mystery, Romance, sad moments and moments of great joy. It's a film for all ages, even those who do not like animated / cartoon can see the class of this movie.The sad thing about this film is that no one longer creates masterpieces like this.10 out of 10."
"This is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. Sounds silly? It may, considering it is an animated film which a majority of people don't take seriously when in the subject of the greatest movies anyone has ever seen. I personally love animated anything, whether it be cartoons, movies, shorts, etc. The Lion King *IS* the king of all Disney films. We all know the tragic tale of the death of Simba's father, even if we had not seen the movie, thus recognition and praise this movie receives absolutely deserves it no less. This is my favourite movie. The art is simply fantastic. The animation is just breathtaking. The story -- though based off of 'Hamlet' -- is beautiful and will leave you in tears. The voice actors and actresses did an impeccable job for each of the characters' personalities. I especially adore the music. The Lion King had introduced me to African music and I have loved it ever since. The songs in the movie such as ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" (one sung by Elton John, and one sung by Kristle Edwards along with the voices of adult Simba and Nala, both pieces of which I love and listen to everyday) and ""Hakuna Matata"" are divine and catchy, not to mention adorable. I cannot say how much I love this film. I'm in love with it. The producers and directors and every person who had contributed to the making of it did a marvelous job. Overall, this movie is PERFECT. I've watched it a hundred times already and I'll watch it a hundred more without feeling the slightest bit sick of it."
"I hadn't thought much of The Lion King back then because I'd watch anything. But now that I'm older, I can see why many people agree that it's one of the best movies, and I agree. There may be spoilers ahead, so you have been warned.The animation's great, I really like the songs (especially Circle Of Life and Be Prepared), and I also like the characters (like Mufasa, Rafiki, and Timon and Pumbaa). Out of Disney's protagonists, I feel that Simba's story is one that'll always be told for many years to come. From a cub who can't wait to be king to an exiled prince whose father had been killed by his uncle and finally to be a king, retaking the Pridelands from his cruel uncle Scar. This movie has some hidden good values as well, such as heroism, faith, hope, and reconciliation.That's why I think that The Lion King is not only one of the best Disney movies, but it's also one of the best animated movies ever. So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect ten, and I'd definitely recommend this...and even though The Lion King (1994) will always be better than The Lion King (2019), I hope the remake will be good."
"To begin with: this movie is worth watching just for the music. The beginning (also optically beautiful) still gives me goosebumps. If anyone ever deserved the Oscar, it was the two guys who got it for this one! Though it's wonderful entertainment, the film also contains some serious topics, like death, taking responsibility and coping with the past. The characters are charming, the romance between Simba and Nala is really cute, and the song lyrics are worth listening twice.A little warning to parents: as I said, this is a perfect Disney classic and really recommendable to both adults and children - only not for very young ones. The scene of Mufasa's death is very sad and touching, and Scar's and Simba's fight at the end could be considered scary."
"I believe that a great movie is one that clearly conveys a strong message. One that you can use to justify your views on various topics. Only a hand full of movies delivered the aforementioned attribute as well as The Lion King. Although this film's plot is enough to prove its brilliance, factors like voice-acting, background themes, dialogs, etc give an attentive viewer more to be impressed with. Case in point: James Earl Jones's voice boosted Mufasa's powerful appearance. The voice had a commanding tone which rivaled Mufasa's powerful roar. Likewise, there are many details that can make this movie the face of Disney. It has been more than 10 years since its release, and it still boasts a strong stance against far more graphically advanced movies. Kids as well as adults can enjoy this flick, possibly without snacks. I rate this film a ten out of ten while suggesting that everyone watch it at least once."
"Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, The Lion King (1994) is a Disney masterpiece. It provides a colorful and multi-emotional experience while subtly delivering an important life message, enjoyable for people of all ages. Not many films are so enveloping as to successfully simultaneously deliver an action-packed adventure, romance, and comedy. Throughout the entire film, the audience is entranced by the wondrous diegesis that is created, and so easily mourns when it is supposed to mourn and laughs when it is supposed to laugh. The Lion King uses animals as opposed to humans (as in Shakespeare's Hamlet), but this contributes to the experience and message rather than takes away from them. Under all the emotion, this charming film makes a social statement, that the circle of life must inevitably continue, and death should be accepted as long it is part of the natural cycle. As a perfect mix of an emotional experience and a moral message, it's no wonder that The Lion King raked in so much revenue and is seen as one of the best films in Disney history.In many parts of the narrative, the audience is completely wrapped up by the magical atmosphere that the film creates, with help from its beautiful original score. In the scene where Mufasa dies, the audience follows Simba, both visually and emotionally, through the discovery of his father's limp body and the acceptance of his passing away. The audience feels the fear and desperation of the little Simba cub as he sees Mufasa motionless on the floor. The audience weeps for Simba as he tries to ""wake up"" his father. Later in the film, when adult Simba meets Nala, the musical accompaniment, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (composed by Elton John) (1994), really creates the romantic mood that devours the audience's heart. When Timon and Pumbaa break the audience out of that oneiric state with their funny antics, and even when they break the fourth wall, they offer a reprieve from the intense emotion present in the rest of the film. These reprieves strengthen the emotions created rather than diminish them. They are an asset to the deep emotions awakened by The Lion King.The use of lions instead of humans might be expected to reduce the emotional intensity of the film, but instead it actually, in some ways, increases it. With animals, the audience experiences defamilarization, as the death of a lion, although still sad, is less taboo and tragic than a death of human. If human Scar had murdered human Mufasa, the audience would experience boundless hate for Scar, rather than experiencing the sadness of Simba as it was supposed to. Using animals also made the diegesis much more colorful and kid-friendly. Using human characters would have created a whole other unwanted experience.Aside from the emotional aspect of the film, The Lion King also disguises a powerful social statement. At the end of the film, the child of Simba and Nala is declared the heir of the pride, as Simba was at the beginning of the film. This metaphorically completes ""The Circle of Life"" (also composed by Elton John) (1994), the title of the opening score. The audience learns that Mufasa's death was inevitable, and sooner or later Simba will die too. Death must happen to complete the cycle, and the past should not be clung on to. This important message is what makes The Lion King more than a simple narrative and a delight for 5-year-olds and 50-year-olds alike.The Lion King was made 17 years ago, yet still stands as an artful classic, despite it being an animation movie. This is a result of the intense emotional experience that an audience can't help but be enveloped by, and a powerful life lesson that is delivered flawlessly. Throughout the action, romance, and sudden comedy, the audience follows without any difficulty at all, and at the end, learns a valuable lesson. The choice to use animals also benefited the film. Aside from making the film more kid-friendly, it precisely manipulated the audience's feelings. The Lion King is a shining gem in film history, a gem that will truly stand the test of time.The Lion King will remain one of my favorite films for a long time, and if you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should."
"Better than the 2019 remake. Animation for live action isn't a good switch on this movie. Animals in the original can express and show emotions, which kept me emotionally involved in the movie. The 2019 movie is absolutely stunning graphically, but couldn't get into it like the original because the animals can't express feeling in their voice or face."
The Lion King is one of Disney's all time best films with a great combination of humour and emotion. The animation is incredible and it's well paced. The performances from all of it's excellent cast are great. Hans Zimmer's score is amazing and the animation is beautiful. All of the songs are all fantastic and it's consistently very funny.
"After watching the copycat CGI version of this masterpiece, I went home and straight watched this again, cannot recommend enough to avoid the ""live-action"", and rewatch this instead. Amazing, incomparable."
"Disney's masterpiece destined to be worshiped for the future generations. 1994 and here we are, witnessing the spectacle that the cycle of life represents, decades passing by and souls maturing. Yes, they are animals, but that's the point. The world's creation is futile in its banal self-destructiveness, but miraculous in its varied colors, instincts and traits. This is a unique feature film for animation capable of rising all kinds of sentiments to the surface at an exotic rhythm."
"The Lion King is by general consensus the greatest Disney film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition. Notably, it is the highest rated Western animation on IMDb's own Top 250, which while flawed and imprecise is a good indicator of quality.A loose adaption of Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King is visually stunning, the peak of hand-drawn animation, with a strong voice cast and a wide selection of memorable tunes. It is a tight ~80 minutes, and one sometimes forgets just how quick the movie moves, yet it does so deftly. The characters are well defined, and the arc of Simba's growth, the core of the film, evolves satisfyingly. One could question whether more time should have been spent on Simba's growth in the middle act (there is incredulous imagery as Simba grows exponentially next to the stasis of Timon and Pumba), but to meander so would ask it to be an entirely different film.While it is not uncommon for a side character or two overshadow the main (see the Genie in Aladdin), Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (adult and young Simba respectively) are at risk from nearly all of the phenomenal cast. James Earl Jones is a commanding presence, and Jeremy Irons as Scar steals every scene. The 'fools' of the film, be it Timon & Pumba, the Hyena trio or even Zazu, all provide the levity believably, that would otherwise leave an incredibly sombre film. Nala is powerful, though one must note that she seems at times far more capable than Simba to actually achieve anything. Nevertheless, Simba's coming-of-age arc, while predictable, is enjoyable, helped along by fantastic charisma and choice songs.The fact that the film has spawned a wildly successful musical gives a strong indication of the quality of the music, but what is less said is how beautiful the film is. As The Lion King was being released, works were already moving away from hand-drawn animation, with Toy Story released a year later. And The Lion King might be the peak of hand-drawn, with an enormous palate of creativity and variety. The opening vista for 'Circle of Life', the bursts of colour in 'Can't wait to be King' and the sombre tone of 'Be Prepared' all are gorgeous. Yet, special mention must go to the Stampede scene, one of the finest scenes of animation ever.One thing I've developed from multiple viewings is how Timon and Pumba might be the weakest part of the movie. First, their 'life lessons' are essentially reversed by Rafiki. Certainly they are qualified to the point of being narratively sidelined. They feel contrived and even a detraction from the meat of the movie. Their role is the fast food portion of the film- the quick fix over more meatier bits of the film. The entertainment provided is enjoyable regardless, and is essential to round off the movie as Disney.The Lion King is endlessly re-watchable, catchy, fun, while remaining a fantastic piece of cinema and an invaluable part of the Disney canon. Magnificent."
"I think the reviewers Stuckmann & Jahns will have the 2019 TLK Summer Blockbuster live action version on the worst of list in December.Still here in autumn 2013 the reviews are still coming in.Back then in Christmas 1994 I saw the movie in the cinema, and came back many times for this movie.The movie deserved some Oscars for use of sound.An all star cast are included with names like Whoopi Goldberg that suits her role as the crazy hyena Shenzi.Jeremy Irons does what he can to play the powerful villain that get what he deserved by being assaulted by the hyenas he had control over.Back at the beginning of the movie we see Simba the lion being raised with his family.But Simba's uncle Scar wants to kill Simba's father that is the king.Simba must flee after his father is killed under a wildebeest stampede.Now it's up to Simba as older later on to get revenge on Scar.This is a classic Disney movie with something for everyone.Songs both dark and playful, thrills and funny scenes.10/10"
"This movie still brings me to tears, even after all of these years! This is one of my favorite Disney movies, ranked high up on the list along with Tangled and Little Mermaid. I am so happy that they finally re-released it on DVD!! I only wish that I had bought it when it was first released on DVD so that I could have gotten the 2 disc special. Although some of the songs are cheesy and others are great, like, I Can't Wait to be King!! I believe that this movie will continue to be a Disney classic. I just hope that my kids will enjoy this movie as much as I always have.Hakuna Matata!"
"This movie will never get old, no matter how many times we watch it and no matter how old we are. Today it made a dear friend of mine's day better. So, if this movie wasn't made, my friend would be having a sad day, but thanks to the people who made this movie happen, my friend is all good now, and I love anyone who makes my baby girl's day better. When a movie manages to cheer up a person more than 10 years after it was made, then it proves to everyone that it was one successful movie. If you're having a sad day, maybe you should watch this movie. If a friend is having a sad day, maybe you should suggest this movie to them."
"The Lion King (1994) Movie Review Directed by: Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers The Lion King is more than just a Disney animation. Its two Oscar wins was well-deserved. The main characters – Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa exemplify the different traits present in our society. Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff work together to direct a film that not only shows us the beauty of life and nature, but the moral values we should all seek to sustain who we are. Roger Allers is credited for writing some of the best known Disney classic films such as Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). Robert Minkoff not only directed The Lion King but other movies such as Stuart Little (1999) and The Forbidden Kingdom (2008). These two directors teamed together to play a role in a film that had a moralistic approach. Life is wonderful – don't run away from it, appreciate it and always know family and friends can help you in ways you'd never expect.Looking beyond the obvious characters on screen, each of them can be characterized by a specific expectation. Simba must transition from a young cub (boy) to a leader (adult). Mufasa must rule a land and protect his family; he went as far as he could to protect his son – to the point where he lost his life. Mufasa's fatherly actions teach us that with true love, a parent is willing to exceed limitations to secure his own child. Scar is a representation of evil, greed, and jealousy. He was willing to kill his own brother and nephew to assume a higher rank. He is often portrayed with many high angles, a sign of his dominance and leadership amongst the hyenas and the power he holds over them. Timon and Pumbaa represent the friends who support and guide you when you're troubled. The comedic sense of the duo lightens up the mood of young Simba, giving the viewer reassurance upon Simba's faith and emotions. Nala gives the film a romantic turn, adding on to the idea that love and support can guide someone in the right direction. A major influence that aided the communication in the film was the musical score. In the scene in which Mufasa explains to Simba what the stars in the sky were, a significant musical score plays in the background. This same musical score appears again when Simba is grown and tells Timon and Pumba his father's explanation of the stars. As Simba walks away from his two friends, it presents itself as Simba's remembers his father. This music appears more than once in the film, setting up a connection between previous and present scenes, it was placed at each particular point of the film for a reason. The color and lighting tones between Mufasa and Scar gave way to the differences between them. The darker tones represented Scar's faded thoughts. The little lighting provided in his scenes showed that he was of a sadistic nature whereas Mufasa is presented in brighter lighting among nature and mostly outdoors. Scar is usually located in the interior of a cave or other dwelling – enclosing him in the darkness that eventually drives his jealousy. Cultural aspects of Africa are introduced immediately in the beginning of the film with the first song. The majority of the animals also show the beauty of nature and the variety of animal life that exists. The song ""The Circle of Life"" sets off a major theme of the film – creating the idea that life is a constant circle, there is life and then there is death. After Mufasa dies, a new ruler had to assume his position – Simba. The circle kept going until the film concluded with a new life – the child of Simba and Nala. Once again, the circle has fulfilled its goal of life and death. ""The amazing thing is that I think when we (Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers) made this movie; it's safe to say that we didn't really fully understand the impact this movie was going to have on people.and how long it was going to kind of stick around."" The Lion King shares that universal theme that we are all part of ""the circle of life"", live life with true happiness and do the right thing. Take out time to love those who care and not to back down from fear – face it. Rob Winkoff and Roger Allers may not have realized it when the film was released in 1994, but The Lion King has become a Disney classic, true to the standards of morality and teaching us how magical and complex life is truly is."
"i saw this film when i was 4 years old and i loved it, and now i saw the 3D trailer. and i just back to remember this film. and i saw it again. and i still i loved it. Disney is one of the bigger companies ever made. some films are bad. anothers film are good. others film are awesome. and only one film is the best ever: 2050 and still this movie will be the best from Disney. the music i loved it. Hans simmer is a great composer and musician, Elton john' musics are pretty good. the art direction of the film was great, and the voice talent too, this film is one of the best in history, my mom is 42 years old and she likes this film also my father (53 years old), the people who says that this film is horrible, bad, one of the worst or the worst movie ever. those people are crazy,this is one of the best from Disney."
"Personally I enjoy most of Disney movies but this one has a special place for many reasons. The main one is that it brings me back to my childhood, and at that time I enjoyed the movie so much. I even had the VHS in English and Spanish version. Then the film came out on DVD and I also bought it. When it first came out on IMAX for any reason I couldn't go to see it again so now for the 3D release I definitely was not going to miss that opportunity. And all I can say is that this film will be forever inmortal. At the theater that I went there were people in the mid 20s like myself singing the songs, repeating the lines, it is just something that you don't see everyday. About the movie, everything has been said before: it is just so perfect, so balanced, it is a treat for the eyes for its amazing animation, it makes you laugh histerically with lovable characters like timon and pumba, it has a lot of emotional moments (spoilers) yes mufasas death is very sad but what really gets to me is when mufasa gets into the stampede to protect simba that is just heart breaking for me its not the death itself but the events that occur before his dead. Also at the very end when Simba takes his place as king is just magical, powerful it gives me chills when the bones are washed away by the rain while simba listens the voice of his father ""remember"" definitely this is pure gold a movie for old and young and a gem that will absolutely will pass the test of time."
"It is everyday that you get a film. However, it is not everyday that you get a film that is original and inspirational. The Lion King is a perfect example of that for it's a masterpiece that I guarantee will entertain people of all ages! The plot is pretty straightforward, but I think it has creativity in every way. It follows Simba, a young lion cub who is destined to become the new king of the African Savannah, after his father, Mufasa. However, Mufasa's jealous brother, Scar wishes to claim the throne for himself and intends to kill both Mufasa and Simba, with the help of a dastardly yet comical pack of hyenas. Going into self-exile when told that he is responsible for his father's death by a planned wildebeest stampede (we all know who really did it, don't we?), Simba grows up while befriending the famous duo, Timon and Pumbaa, then is eventually persuaded to defeat his uncle Scar and become the rightful king. A plot such as this is so compelling, it is uncanny. As for the characters, each and every one of them is brilliantly made, and the voice actors are well chosen, my personal favourites being James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa, Whoopi Goldberg (well known for her role in Sister Act) as the lead hyena Shenzi and the fabulous Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, a hornbill and the king's majordomo. And let's not forget Nathan Lane as Timon and Jeremy Irons as Scar! The rest of the film is equally fantastic. The main reason I love TLK is that its characters are animals, in the African Savannah (I am a big fan of African wildlife)! For those who have not seen The Lion King, watch it! Now! I promise you will praise the film for all it's worth (made even better with its unique and epic soundtrack) and you will not regret watching it. As a conclusion, I give The Lion King a 10 and recommend it highly."
"I first heard of this wonderful Disney feature when I popped in the Aladdin tape, and I knew it was going to be my favorite. A year later, I saw it in a theatre as a double feature paired with Angels in the Outfield. It was so good I did not want to see it come to an end. I begged to see it again and I got my chance at a library and it was just as mesmerizing. I finally got it on video and to this day it never fails to impress. With gorgeous animation, memorable characters, unbelievable score, and a well thought out story with a great message for anyone of any age (""We are all connected in the the great circle of life"", said Mufasa), what's not to like? My favorite song is Hakuna Matata (of course!) but I have many of these songs stuck in my head from time to time. To top it all off, I recently saw the Broadway musical and you owe it to yourself to see it.Hakuna Matata!"
"This movie wasn't just another kid's animation movie, It was much more exciting than the other movie's, The Story Was Excellent, Every Character was noticeable and from my sight they was not boring at all, Not even one of them. They Created Simba very childish And naughty, But they also Add to him Innocent and honest. I think most of us like Timon And Pumba, I especially like Timon (Not only because I love meerkats) He's perpendicular and A show off, But there is something about him that easy to like, He's funny Sometime's He's even sensitive, Now Pumba, Thats one lovely warthog! He's so innocent, They add a lot to The Lion King. I'v seen this movie many time's, And every section that Mufasa died, I cried. The music was brilliant, very noticeable, They(Elton John, Tim Rice) Surely deserve an Oscar.The Best Animation Film. Sincerely, BanditIdan from the Bandit's Guild"
"There is no word to describe how great this movie really is, not just as an animated movie but as a proper movie too. I watched it today because i have missed it, it's been 7 or 8 years since i watched this movie, the music i mean is amazing and special thanks to Elton John for that. This is the building block for all animated movies, well done to Disney, directors, animators and actors for such an amazing movie. I guess no matter how old you are you are bound to love this movie, i have found nothing wrong with it at all, it is legendary if you have not watched it yet you definitely should.Storyline great, animation great, music amazing almost everything about this movie is spot on.It will always have a special place in everyone's heart. I guess one word to describe it is Epic!"
"Great film! Perfect music, animation, art, cast and story. The best animated motion picture ever! Has it all: adventure, drama, romance and comedy. See it with your own eyes! Based in Bambi and Hamlet. This mix is fantastic. Disney should learn again how to make movies. Forget the Nemos, Chickens and Incredibles junk. This is the film of your life! If you don't have it buy it or rent it. If you have it watch it again! Fall in love with this film!The story of a prince and his growing up... He has to deal with friendship, family, exile, death, envy, power, love, sex, and regret. You will grow with him while you watch this. The greatest story ever told. Forget the usual romantic comedies. This is the film of your life."
"Walt Disney's ""The Lion King"". This movie remains near and dear to my heart, and not just because I've grown up with it. This Disney film, with it's beautiful backgrounds, amazing voice talents, wonderful music, addicting songs, and touching moments stay with you for your entire life. Lion King remains one of the few movies I tear up at every time, no matter how old I am. Mufasa's death is undoubtedly one of the saddest deaths in movie history, along with the death of Bambi's mother, and Bridge to Terabithia. Watching the movie in class brings out tissues and ""It's my allergy"" excuses all around, as Simba nudges his father's still body, begging him to wake up. Eager lion cubs in an elephant graveyard, goose-stepping hyenas, lovable meerkats doing the hula and a lion cub held up in a ray of sunlight are moments that stay with viewers forever. One of Disney's best, and will remain so forever."
"From the rising sun, to the up roaring film finale the lion king is the Disney film i hold closest to my childhood. I can still remember being 3 years old and getting to the cinema late, and cheering out loud at the end, yeah it would seem that now at the age of 16 turning 17 i'd have seen films a lot more closer to home and i have, but as a young child i was very observant of characters even though they were cartoons. Even though I was only three i never forget the film, I never cried at the sad points of the film and no i never really fully understood it until i watch it a few years later but i always remembered Simba's realisation that his life would never be the same. If you haven't seen the lion king *slap in the face* believe me you are missing what i describe as the last Disney film old Walt would be proud of. 10/10"
"The lion king is one of my favourite movies of all time. It is possibly Disney's best movie and is one that any person of any age group will adore. My dad worked for Disney's video department and he got all the great Disney movies and of all of them the lion king is perhaps the best along with Aladdin and toy story. It has the worst Disney villain in the form of scar, has a truly touching story which captivates the watcher and has some of the best Disney characters to date. It won 2 Oscars one of them for best original song in the shape of ""can you feel the love tonight"". Personally i much prefferd and thought that ""the circle of life"" ""I just cant wait to be king"" or ""Hakuna Matata"". This is possibly the last great hand drawn Disney movie as well as toy story followed up a couple of years later. Truly a delight to watch and one of the best movies ever made.You have got to watch it."
"This is another one of my favourite films it never grows old. It is perfect to all ages. The sound track is absolutely amazing i find myself singing along to all of the songs every time i watch it (nice one Elton). It is one of only two animated films which actually make me cry which i believe is pretty hard for a film to do. Erm it is my childhood film the one that you watch so much the tape began to go weird, it was one of the only films i bought in DVD to replace the tape. It suite's all ages and all sexes. It doesn't matter what kind of films you like you'll love The Lion King. It is ideal for sitting in with a pizza to watch with the family and friends."
"The intro is better than in any Broccoli-Bond, the plot has a age-span that exceeds 25 years. I watched it together with my daughter, and we both enjoyed the movie but from two different horizons... And the characteristics are better placed than in any heavy Ingmar Bergman-movie.I was seven years old when The Jungle Book first appeared, my daughter was 6 when The Lion King came - suddenly I understood why it is The Greatest Movie I have ever seen."
"This movie was such a sweet heartwarming tale. It had its funny moments its action it really is a perfect movie for the kids. And for the adults the acting was great and it had a very good story very predictable but not when I was a kid.This movie is about a young lion cub ""Simba"" who is tricked into thinking he was responsible for his fathers death so ridden with guilt he leaves the pride and goes off on his own. He grows up on his own but meets lifelong friends on the way.This was such an adorable tale. Everyone is sure to love this movie exspecially the kids but the adults will find it very sweet and heartwarming as well."
"The Lion King was the best Disney film of 1994, and perhaps for a few years after. We all know Disney's been hashing up cheap tricks for kids-dumb sequels like Lady and the Tramp 2, Cinderella 2, all that stuff recently. But the Lion King was great, and the all star cast including: Rowan Atkinson, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones really help this film too! Great animation, story, and characters. The Lion King's a great film!3.5/5 STARS-JOHN ULMER"
"OK I know I am probably alone here, but I was a little disappointed with this film. Maybe the hype surrounding it gave me greater expectations, who knows? I thought it was a good plot, (although an overused plot in movies)and some of the characters were really good. But I found parts of the movie boring and the music not up to Disney standards. Elton John got an Oscar I believe, but can't see why.Best parts of the movie are the interactions between Simba and Scar. In fact I thought that Jeremy Irons performance was outstanding.The animation was pretty hit and miss I thought.So sorry TLK fans but I wasn't thrilled by this movie."
