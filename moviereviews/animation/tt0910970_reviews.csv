"Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in ""WALL·E"" is it. ""WALL·E"" eclipses even Andrew Stanton's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar's best film to date and, call me crazy as I've just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.""WALL·E"" is everything we've come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.""WALL·E"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""WALL·E"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""WALL·E"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). The social commentary in ""WALL·E"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.What is most surprising about ""WALL·E"" is how sad it is. Not even in the 'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them' way ""Finding Nemo"", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It's a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E's only companion before EVE shows up, but I won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with ""WALL·E"". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don't think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""WALL·E"", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.9.5/10"
"I just returned from an advanced benefit screening of WALL*E, and I want to be careful not to spill too much regarding the movie. I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very ""virtual"", for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life ""grit."" The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it's previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping! My most sincere compliments to Andrew Stanton, Jim Morris, John Lasseter, Ben Burtt, and all the creative forces at Pixar. Can't wait to see what the future brings..."
"I'm starting to wonder if there is bad Disney/Pixar film, I mean, normally when we think of the combo, it does equal gold, we automatically know that everyone is going to love this movie, it's just a matter of comparison to the other animation films. I'm not just saying this because I had a good time when I was watching this, I'm very serious, this is my favorite Disney/Pixar film. It's completely worth the ticket price, this couldn't have been a more perfect film. Everything about WALL·E is just beyond great: the characters, the story, and the incredible animation. But the thing that I loved about WALL·E is it's message, I know that it does go a little over board with the ""jog or get fat"", ""throw your garbage away"", and the ""we've become too dependent on machines"" message, but I felt this was the most charming way to present it to the children who have to grow up in a world where they're going to have to worry about global warming, this may open their eyes a little.WALL·E is a robot that is left all alone on Planet Earth, Earth is now covered with garbage. The humans have left onto a corporate ship and are living their lives care free and well, thought free. WALL·E has been collecting little human pieces here and there and making them into his treasures, but the one thing he really wants is a friend. One day a ship lands with a female robot, Eve, who WALL·E just adores, but Eve is on a mission to find a plant to bring back onto the human ship to show that Earth is safe. But when the ship grabs Eve, WALL·E follows her and discovers the mutiny that is afoot on the ship. Everyone is overweight, can't walk, can't think for themselves, and let's all the robots do all the work for them. But WALL·E and Eve are on the mission to get them back to Earth and give it a little love.WALL·E is seriously the best movie I have seen this summer, I just adored this movie, it has great laughs, cute jokes and is entertaining for the whole family. Like I said before, when it's Disney/Pixar you just can't go wrong. WALL·E is one of their most lovable characters ever and was like the robot version of Charlie Chaplin, he brought great slap stick to the story. This movie delivers everything you can imagine and much more, not to mention a great message. I highly recommend this movie for everyone, it's just a very wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy. The animation, I can't believe how far we've come, but this was a beautifully made movie and couldn't have been better. I loved WALL·E, this is a movie that will bring you plenty of laughs for your summer.10/10"
"We went to the San Francisco Film Institute's first public screening at their campus in Emeryville. Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same 'wow' feeling as after seeing Ratatouille. Considering that animated films have always played second-fiddle to live-action, and have been aimed at kids, it's ironic that once again Pixar produces a film that rivals any live action on every level. Bravo!"
"Over the years I've become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience. 'WALL-E' is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There's hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other's name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve's silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done. The animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it's mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E's loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being 'just plain silly'. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While 'WALL-E' tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It's a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar."
"Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.This film is beautifully animated, of course, to that magical Pixar point where even piles of what should be disgusting trash somehow look breathtakingly gorgeous and even fairly realistic-looking roaches look cute. But much more importantly, the heart, the emotion in this movie is unlike anything I've experienced at the cinema since Forrest Gump. Certainly my tear ducts have not welled up while watching a movie this much since then. I fell in like with the character of Wall-E when I saw the trailer. Watching the movie, I fell in love with him within about 2 minutes. Shortly after that, I fell in love with the idea of Wall-E falling in love.My previous favorite movie romance is Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman films. The love story, or the love experience of Wall-E and Eve is perhaps the first I've seen since then that operates at and succeeds on that same level. These couples create an uncomplicated, innocent, simple, yet deep and powerful bond. They capture the experience of love at first sight, writ large. They possess an instant chemistry that tells you they belong together from the first time they see one another and makes you root for their relationship throughout the film. Wall-E and Eve share moments together of real cinematic beauty, true hilarity, frightening sadness, frustrating difficulty and delightful satisfaction. It's a testament to the level of genius at which the Pixar storytellers are operating that we feel every beat of this relationship resonate every step of the way despite the fact that the characters are robots that are not modeled off of humans and speak no more than a handful of words throughout the movie (this animated movie is refreshingly free of obvious ""guest star"" voices or any over-the-top stand-up comedians trying to upstage the movie).Just like in the first Superman films, once you care about the characters as individuals and care about their relationship, it's almost impossible for the rest of the movie not to work. You're hooked at hello. Wall-E adds all the expected complications to keep the would-be lovers from getting together most of the time. There is a truly great ""McGuffin"" that keeps the heroes and villains busy for quite a while (the item in question is something outwardly simple that ends up holding the key to something more important than anything in the world). The pacing during most of these adventures is as breakneck as anything out of the Star Wars films and the action is always staged with crystal clarity. There are several scenes of peril for Wall-E that are reminiscent of that oddly powerful sequence in Short Circuit 2 when Johnny 5 is almost killed. The filmmakers pull absolutely no punches when it comes to running your heart through the ringer over characters you care about. It probably helps that you can do a lot more physical damage to a robot character than you can to a human character while keeping a G rating and still getting the audience dramatically worried about their survival.Even on top of the action, the emotion, the visuals and the humor, Wall-E goes the extra mile into thought-provoking thematic territory. The film never hits you over the head with anything preachy and doesn't really even outright tell you what its opinions on the subjects it raises are. It also doesn't explicitly lay out explanations for everything that exists in Wall-E's world (there are no ""talking killer"" scenes and very little verbal exposition). I think the bits of ambiguity work here because they add to the sense of mystery, helplessness and alienation that most of the characters in the movie feel to some degree.There are human characters in this movie too, quite a few. I think that's necessary because if humans aren't shown in a robot world, you have to wonder what purpose were the robots designed to serve? That was a curiosity of the earlier CGI movie, Robots. Most of the humans in Wall-E aren't as developed as the robots, but I think that's because they exist more to represent the whole of humanity rather than particular individuals. We're asked to ponder the consequences of the choices they make as though the whole society was moving in that direction, not just one person. Wall-E and Eve are the heart of this movie but the humans are used to add some intellectual gravity for the audience to chew on.Other choices made in the movie might also leave room for debate, such as the integration of some live-action footage into the film. But because the movie as a whole is so audaciously stimulating and brilliantly satisfying, it's a plus that they left us with a few unresolved or unusual things to think about and question after getting off of the great emotional and visual roller-coaster experience. Wall-E truly serves up everything that I think an audience could want in a movie experience. It will be very easy for me to watch this one over and over again. It is a modern-day classic that I believe should earn a place in cinema history as the ""2001"" of CGI animated films, both of them movies of indisputable brilliance, unyielding imagination and unending entertainment.Footnote: The pre-movie short is an awesome, violent Looney Tunes/Roger Rabbit-esquire toon. It wants only to entertain and does."
"I can't say enough about how good this movie, that you probably haven't read, so I'm going to keep this short.This is the best thing out there in theater's right now, and might just be the best animated film of all time, whether you believe that or not, is your own opinion, but what Pixar has done here, can put companies like Dreamworks, Sony, and Blue sky to shame.Wall E also may go down as the most lovable character ever to grace the movie screen, I praise Ben Burtt and Andrew Stanton, and the people at Pixar for what they did, and will continue to do.This is why Pixar is the top studio in the world.10/10"
"This truly is one beautiful, touching animated sci-fi film....I cannot stress this enough. It's a unique cinema experience that you must enjoy firsthand.The tale is set in the 22th century , Earth has become a lifeless wasteland full of garbage, that the human race evacuated nearly a millennium ago....Lifeless, that is with the two exceptions being the ""artifical"" life form ""WALL-E"" & his pet cockroach.WALL-E is a squat humble trash-compacting robot who while continuing to fulfill the duties he was programmed for ( even though it's pointless considering there are no more humans on the planet ) collects certain leftover nicknacks, novelty items and even old films that he can still play. He mentally stimulates himself and enjoys fragments of the culture that is now gone ( that of the human race ). Though, WALL-E has imprinted on his little cockroach & vice versa, the little robot longs for more companionship.He receives it in the form of a beautiful, sleek, defensive ""fembot fatale"" ""EVE ""....In their own little forms of robotic communication ( repeating each other's names in various connotations depending on moods ; ""WAAAALLL-E,"" ""EEEEEEEE-VAH!"" ) and WALL-E's Chaplin-esquire clumsiness that amuses EVE, the pair imprint on each other and enjoy each other's company.Sadly, EVE has located a small plant and must return it to her mother ship and leave WALL-E forever...But WALLL-E hops aboard the ship in pursuit of his darling ""EEEEEE-VAH"".And yes this film has very little dialog, but guess what, IT DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' DIALIOUGUE!....The brilliance and beauty of the film is in the interactions and responses of the little robots : a great representation of what ""artificial intelligence"" really is and what it may actually be one day! And how ironic it is that in this film the organic HUMAN RACE has become soulless, mirthless, artless, jaded, self-centered cogs in a machine of blind consumerism, yet the mechanical artificial beings still respond to their surroundings like a toddler or pet : with curiosity, wonder, and delight in communication & learning.And yes there is plenty of comic relief ( albeit sans dialouge ) so no this movie is NOT BORING....It's beautiful, it even made me a little bit misty-eyed.So yeah if you're an a fan of animated films, sci-fi films, and romance you should definitely check out this movie.Obviously, it is going to win a very well-deserved Oscar for ""Best Animated Film""."
"Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong story lines and vivid characters. The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube. He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence. Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe. Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve. Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably. Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love. On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control. Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination. It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character. He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would. He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid. Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home. Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly. I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling. Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features. In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults. Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement. The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human! Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president. Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films. The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camera-work. The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space. Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those 'save the earth' and 'think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story. There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor. It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience. Bravo to the folks at Pixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us."
"Just got back from a special sneak peek/advance screening of this movie, and I must say, Pixar continues to amaze. They just can't seem to make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, I will admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my ""least favorite"" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. This one, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful -- this movie succeeds on every front! I am not going to get into spoilers or specific plot aspects, but I will say that I am almost definitely going to see this one again in the theater..and it will be worth every dime. Come Friday, be in line to see Wall-E. You don't want to miss it!"
"I just saw the screener in the theater and was amazed. I am the kind of person that has never liked science fiction movies. I have tried all the famous movies in this genre, like Star Wars, The Matrix and A Space Odyssey and hated all of them. Next to me in the theater were a couple of Sci-fi-lovers and they loved Wall-E beyond belief. I did too, however. Wall-E is: A) A great story B) Packed with fun and humor C) Built up with memorable characters D) Fun for all ages E) Revolutionary in animation techniques The world Pixar creates is so credible, you forget it is animation. Thumbs up for Wall-E as well, he is such a cute and adorable character, you will fall in love with him immediately. I loved EVE as well."
"Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar best film so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which I thought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is the best Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind and Finding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one. WALL-E will forever be remembered as one of the most lovable characters ever created on film!!!"
"I thought that Pixar was one of the greater animation studios of the new millennium; after seeing Wall-E, I'm convinced that Pixar is the greatest modern animation studio, and perhaps one of the most talented and treasured film companies period. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel with Wall-E, pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that's more intelligent, heartfelt, thought provoking, and flat-out masterful than any movie in years.The film start's off on a simultaneously sweet and sour note: The opening reveals the gorgeous backdrop of galaxies and stars, with music from the movie 'Hello-Dolly!' overlapping it all in a sugary visual treat. Not seconds later, the camera traverses space to slowly close in on the planet Earth which, 700 years in to the future, has gained a sickly green tint to it along with an orbital atmosphere of pure garbage. Further zooming reveals a desolated city (New York, maybe?) its buildings and bridges rotted way. The entire opening is very reminiscent of the recent I Am Legend, except much, much more ruined. It is however, technically beautiful; the images are so photo realistic that you're amazed that they've been generated by computer. The only remnants of humanity are monstrous skyscrapers of compacted trash and billboards aplenty advertising the bright and colorful, yet somehow ominous company known as Buy n' Large, a thinly veiled Wal-Mart clone. And, of course, Wall-E itself.Wall-E is far more than a mere 'it', however. Through hundreds of nuanced and heartfelt animation quirks, as well as the ""voice"" given by Ben Burtt, Star-Wars veteran and creator of another famed beeping robot named R2-D2, Wall-E has been imbued with enough life to fill three-dozen cheap summer kids flicks, all without ever saying more than two or three actual words.Wall-E has been operating for centuries, long after his other Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class counterparts have shut down or broken apart, scouring the wastelands of earth and compacting the land's garbage in to neat little cubes.It's a lonely job, with the little robot's only companion being a spunky little cockroach. Wall-E has over the years collected an impressive amount of junk with which he passes the time, including lighters, toys, spare parts, and an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly!, which is Wall-E's instructor in the ways of life, love, and keenly choreographed dance. Indeed, Wall-E gazes upon two lovers holding hands and the look in his binocular eyes is both heartbreaking and beautiful. It all changes however, when a beautiful robot from the human colony in space arrives; her name is EVE. Despite here tendencies to blow up anything that moves, Wall-E is smitten at first sight, and EVE comes to eventually share those feelings. After taking note of a very unique possession of Wall-E's however, EVE reports back to the Earth ship Axiom and is whisked away back in to space. Wall-E, being as devoted as he is, follows her into the unknown, and it is there that the movie really gets going, with Wall-E and EVE taking part in an adventure with the fate of humanity itself in the balance. Characters like the Captain of the Axiom (voiced by Jeff Garlin) appearing to flesh out the film's plot, as well as a gaggle of amusing ""rogue"" robots that aide Wall-E and EVE in their quest. As the movie develops, however, the leading characters' romance becomes the core of the movie, with Wall-E and EVE's love being one of the few genuinely lovely and convincing romances of recent cinema. The touching moments Wall-E shares with EVE in his workshop, as well as their first ""kiss"" preceding a marvelous dance through space highlight a relationship that tugs at the heartstrings and moistens the eyes far more than movies like Fool's Gold or What Happens in Vegas. The romance between the two leads is the very soul of the movie, and could not have been better executed. The film is gorgeous to boot: With colors and images that dazzle and linger long after the film is over. Films like No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, as beautiful as they are, seem to revel in the gloom of browns and blacks. Wall-E, on the other is vibrant and alive, turning even the beginning's post-apocalyptic wasteland in to a marvel. The biggest surprise of Wall-E, however, would be its surprising amount of maturity. Wall-E deals with themes of pollution, rampant consumerism, societal complacency and obesity, media desensitization, and other themes that would frankly fly over a child's head. Kids will see a world full of people who are humorously fat and happy; older members of the audience, however, will see a society that tells of a future not centuries ahead of us but perhaps only decades. The overblown laziness and rampant consumerism is evident already today, and the notion of Wall-E's future being so similar is funny yes, but also a touch unnerving.It is for this reason that I hold Wall-E in such high esteem: It is a heartfelt work of inarguable art that not only entertains but holds enough conscience and commentary to get even the most casual of moviegoer thinking about the future. It is beautiful and it is heartbreaking. It is funny and it is also a tad scary. It has two supposedly life-less robots teaching humanity the very meaning of being human, as well as learning the meaning of true love themselves. It made me laugh, it made me (almost) cry. It has the distinction of being Pixar's best movie, as wells as the hands down best movie of the year (so far); an almost perfect, if not completely perfect summer movie that kids and adults will almost assuredly love.And it is also one of the greatest movies I have ever seen."
"When it comes to animated films, Pixar are masters of the craft. Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.The film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.It is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!"", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.Then, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).This love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.Beautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.And that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'. -Dan Henry, 20th July 2008"
"Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without sayingbetter than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.I credit the filmmakers for showcasing a world that has been left unlivable due to pollution and excess, yet never stooping to the level of liberal propaganda to soapbox an environmental agenda. No, the idea of ""going green"" or ""stop global warming"" never comes out blatantly, but instead we are shown the message of how technology is making us gluttons and sloths, reliant for everything and unable to even see what is going on right in front of our faces. Humanity, drifting on a space station for 700 years being waited on hand and foot, has become a giant mass of inactive waste. Watching their awakening at the hands of a little waste removal machine, seeing love, life, and beauty as if for the first time ever is a wonderful thing. Sure the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey is fantastic, but these moments work on another level altogetherthat of truth. Consumer culture and materialism has destroyed our society to the point that social status depends on the car you drive and the trinkets you can collect rather than the job you do and the work you put in. To see the Captain of the vessel, housing what has become of the human race, slowly open his eyes to what could be is mind-blowingly simple, yet also so necessary for children these days to see what burying their heads in the computer and cell phone is doing to the societal structure of the world. We need to stop being lemmings, droning along without purpose. There is a reason for life, things to strive for and love is one of them, something very prevalent here.The robots themselves become more human than the humans, showing the emotion and compassion that people have left by the wayside. Curiosity takes center stage as Wall-E finds treasures amongst the trash he has been programmed to clean up for a return of life to Earth. Stacking his compacted boxes of refuse into skyscrapers taller than those left behind, he finds shelter in an abandoned tractor where he keeps spare parts and objects to play with during his solitude. Never expecting a visitor, or the impact that finding a small sapling of greenery could cause, a sophisticated robot named EVE arrives and changes his world forever. Not only does she become the woman of his dreams, but she also causes him to leave Earth and discover the spaceship, which has been trying to find his home for way too long.Maybe it is funny to say, but the chemistry between these two machines is quite palpable and real, as they discover feelings that they shouldn't have due to programming and such, but they have evolved into sentient creatures. They fight for freedom against the spaceship's auto-pilot and take a stand to end the tyranny that has been subtly and effectively beating the humans into submission. Of course they may not be doing it for the humans per se, there is a matter of needing to go back for spare parts, but you'll understand once you see. Sure the Captain does his part to see the hero that Wall-E becomes to his stagnant race and being voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin definitely helps. When he starts viewing the history of Earth and just exudes wonderment and joy, you really enjoy the ride as he attempts to reverse his sloth and actually stand on his two legs for possibly the first time ever.Where I do have a problem with the film is the pacing. Yes, I know there is very little dialogueand I whole-heartedly praise the film for itbut the beginning does have a tendency to drag. Maybe some of that has to do with it being an extended version of the trailer, but it just gets a little tedious as we wait for EVE to arrive and end the cute monotony of Wall-E playing with his finds in ways they aren't supposed to be used for, we've seen it before in The Little Mermaid. Even once they are on the ship, the cat and mouse game gets a little prolonged to pad the runtime a bit. The story here isn't very complex and I just wish there had been more to it, or at least a bit faster paced of a plot progression. Otherwise, though, this is another solid film from Pixar, showing that they definitely have the creativity and storytelling ability to infuse heart back into cinema and try new things rather than regurgitate for a big paycheck."
"We live in a consumerist era. As any visit to a metropolitan area will prove, there is the unfaltering marriage of burgeoning commerce to a burgeoning population. Retail giants now provide services that would take more than a handful of independent stores to supply and this umbrella is continually widening. But how far can this consumerism go before it consumes us? This is where Wall-E begins, setting up the most scathing, yet perhaps most accurate futurist take on consumerism's affect on society in any animated film I've seen to date. In fact, I can't recall any film in the last several years that has taken this approach so seriously. Andrew Stanton once again throws us straight into a darkly themed film, but once again there are serious points to be had. At the outset of the film, we are introduced to a world where the skyscrapers that once housed the internal workings of business are dwarfed and surrounded by skyscrapers built of that very business' refuse. WALL-E spends his days continuously collecting and compacting the mountains of garbage that fill the streets of the city and adding it the trash skyscrapers, piece by piece. We learn very early on that this is the last functional bot of its kind, and perhaps, the only living machine on the planet. But there is something special about this surviving Wall-E; this robot performs its programmed tasks, but it has also become a curious being, collecting and organizing interesting items seen day by day. Wall-E is, essentially, the last bit of humanity left on Earth, since every other human being is either dead or living aboard the space cruise liner, the Axiom.But things change once EVE arrives on Earth. In true fashion with his curious nature, the sight of EVE is enthralling to Wall-E. Here is something new from humanity, not just the garbage and trinkets left behind for Wall-E to sift through and compact. What begins here is the most innocent yet basic of love stories I have seen or read in many years. There is a purity to Wall-E's almost hypnotic and naive interest in EVE. I don't mean this in any religious terms, but rather in the vein that neither robot has prior knowledge of love or adoration, apart from Wall-E's surviving betamax tape of Hello Dolly! as his primary source of inspiration. Everything else is rooted in simple curiosity, but it is amazing how far just that can develop one's character.Wall-E interacts with everything he finds in a very primal manner (the source of that curiosity), slowly learning about the things he finds by essentially playing with them until something happens. EVE is the dedicated but markedly emotional counterpart to Wall-E's primal self. She performs her tasks at the expense of taking notice of Wall-E. By the time she finally catches on to Wall-E's affection, the programmed side of herself sets off their exciting journey into space.Once things set into full-swing, this film does not let go of you. EVE and Wall-E are quite a dynamic duo, although not the romantic pair envisioned in Wall-E's mind for most of the film. I won't go into any further analysis here, lest I spoil the fun for anyone wishing to go see it. But I must say that the fact that we see two robots, two human creations, act as the primary humanizing force is entirely effective and what makes me love this film so much. The overall message of the film emerges from the dark outset and even darker conclusion... The ending credits are a must-view for anyone who sees the film. There is a very emotional sequence of progressions that twice put me to tears for its poignancy and in light of the beginning of the film. The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders.On other notes, the soundtrack is Newman's definitive work in cinema. I didn't think I would say this anytime post Finding Nemo, but it really is true. EVERY bit of music supports the film's imagery and tone while also helping shape it note by note. There is not a wasted note in this film.Also, the visual imagery is utterly beautiful and affecting. Skyscrapers of compacted garbage, the collections in Wall-E's trailer, the outer heavens, the POV's of EVE and Wall-E... All are fantastic. The cinematography is also top-notch. They might have used the back to foreground focus a bit much, but just the fact that they had Roger Deakins consult on their almost perfected simulation cinematography as well as Stanton's directorial 'mindprint' of the film speaks volumes for the studio. It is all found and spoken for in the final print.The thing about this movie is that is able to speak so much without much dialogue. Stanton has obviously learned a great deal in how to use the visual image as powerfully as possible.Verdict: Pixar gets another 10/10. They make films that speak to me in ways no other animation studio ever pulls off. The message may always be positive, but that doesn't mean the trials of Pixar characters are ever just plain and simple affairs. Stanton produced something very very special and endearing here. While the paint may be of a love story and two curious robots, he has captured nothing short of the core of our positive human nature in two inanimate objects. This is a meaningful and important film. How far can we let our lives be simplified before our own creations become more human than ourselves?"
"Wall-E is the film Pixar has been working toward ever since Toy Story first tested the boundaries of computer animation. It is without a doubt the best Pixar film, if not the best computer animated feature ever made, and it ranks with the rest of Disney's classics.The story is both timeless and timely. 700 years after Earth's citizens flew away from their dumpster-like planet, one robot, the dirty and old yet clever and plucky protagonist Wall-E, is still condensing the mountains of trash into nice little piles. He discovers many of the trappings of civilization, most notably an old VHS of ""Hello Dolly!"" which teaches him about true love.His simple life is thrown into disarray by the arrival of another robot, Eve, sent from the humans' ship on a top secret mission. For Wall-E, it is love at first sight. But when Eve is whisked back to the spaceship, Wall-E stows away as well. Soon not only is Wall-E's courage tested, but also the humanity of all the citizens who have now become fat lazy blobs who live gliding along an easy chair.To start, the film looks gorgeous. While that is something we have come to expect from computer animated films thanks to today's technology, yet again we truly see the wonders and mysteries of outer space. But the film is much more than beautiful: it is also hilarious. On one level it has many topical jokes concerning the humans on the ship. But on a higher plane the humor of the robots has the quality of silent comedy, particularly Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (in fact, unlike most of today's very chatty animated films, there is very little dialogue). In addition, the visuals are accompanied by an excellent score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty). Songs from Hello, Dolly insterspersed in the movie also enhance the story. Finally the voices are skilfully done. The robots' sounds convey true character and emotion, and Jeff Garlingives a great performance as the main speaking role of the film, the ship's captain.There is a lot more to say about this film. For one, it owes a huge debt to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the musical selection to the look of the ship. The amount of plunder from Kubrick's genius would be pathetic if the film itself was not brilliant or innovative in its own right. Wall-E is an experience to be seen, to be heard, and to be felt. It is a story of timeless love and a cautionary tale of where we may be going as a species and as a planet. But above all it is a masterpiece of cinema, and a work of art you must see."
"I very rarely give ten out of ten to a movie, but I have no hesitation in giving that perfect score to WALL-E. It is sublime. Not just the best animation I've seen in a long time, but simply one of the best movies I've seen in many months in terms of coherent and effective story-telling and seamless editing. It's extremely well put together. The animation is in a class of its own. My only slightly negative comment might be that clearly this isn't a movie aimed at little kids, and perhaps the marketing strategy is showing too much of the 'cute funnies' and not enough of the sheer artistry of Pixar's vision. This is not a bright, sunny view of the world where everyone lives happily ever after, but quite clearly a message movie; if you agree with the message, you will love this film.Disney may own Pixar these days, but there is an artistic divide between the two production styles. If you want predictable sentimentality watch Disney. I loved Disney's older classics but some of their later offerings  with the exception of Beauty and the Beast which was very good - made me wince when I took my kids along. But in contrast I have loved every single film that Pixar have made since Toy Story in 1995, and if you want something more wry, but still possessing humour and heart, then Pixar is probably going to be your choice.The story is simple enough. It's the year 2700 and the earth has become uninhabitable, not through some terrible cataclysmic event, but by a slow accumulation of suffocating junk. It's a wasteland devoid of living things. As the opening shots pan in, we see that the skyscrapers are actually tall mounds of compressed trash, and that the compressing is being done by WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth class), a small, solitary robot which keeps itself going by scavenging parts from all his clapped out siblings. WALL-E's only companion is a cockroach, and he fills in the time in his trailer home during long dust storms by watching an old video of Hello Dolly. WALL-E is an unlikely hero, rusty but trusty. I hesitate to use the word cute, endearing works better. One day he finds a single plant growing. He doesn't appreciate its significance but takes it home anyway where he squirrels it away with his other treasures such as a Rubic's Cube, a lighter and a trash can lid.Then a space ship lands and EVE emerges (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). Eve is in a whole different class to WALL-E. She can fly, he is earth bound, she is sleek, dangerous and single minded while he is bumbling and rather dowdy. They communicate with beeps and eye twitches, and WALL-E is hooked. When WALL-E gives EVE the plant he has found, she recognizes that her directive  to find evidence of photosynthesis on earth  is fulfilled and shuts down. The ship comes back to pick her up and WALL-E clings on, desperate not to lose her. Arriving at the mother ship, we find the last remaining humans (apparently all American!) who have fled the earth at the behest of the CEO of Buy N Large, a conglomerate who ended up running everything. The humans are pretty much big, obese babies, who have lost the use of their legs and are spoon fed artificial food and platitudinous slogans in equal measure. The rest of the movie involves a plot by the auto pilot to take over the ship and keep it on course away from earth, while the captain tries to take it home, aided by WALL-E and an entertaining array of quirky malfunctioning robots let loose from the repair bay.Some of the best moments are to be found in WALL-E's interaction with everyday objects; a fire extinguisher for example, enables him to zip around in space in a balletic dance with EVE, he uses a lid as a hat to imitate the dancers he sees on his video screen. The humans are not presented as wicked or evil, just unthinking, and the movie ends on a positive and upbeat note, when they recover the use of their legs and return to earth to reclaim it as their home. There are nods to many classic sci-fi movies, Pixar's ubiquitous pizza truck is there near the beginning, and they are not beyond a little self criticism; there's a discarded iPod among WALL-E's accumulated junk.I found myself caring far more about the animated characters in WALL-E than the supposedly human ones in many 'regular' movies. Director Andrew Stanton and everyone at Pixar deserve huge credit for this movie and I hope it is an enormous financial hit for them. I also hope it gets an Oscar nomination, not for best animated feature, but for best film."
"Well I don't even know where to begin there is so much in this one. Well maybe if i say i am usually cinical and disdainful towards love stories (at least those type of love stories you see nowadays...), and i usually see them only suitable for girls who wanna cry a few tissue full, and i prefer a Shakespeare-like ending, where every major character dies or loses something (sanity, beloved one etc) over an usual corny happy ending, and then i add, that i still LOVED this masterpiece so much i myself cried in the end, and i was cheering for Wall-E to remember to Eve, to get repaired and to see them ""live happily ever after"". I was browsing on a video-sharing channel some day and i stumbled upon a video where a guy says the following about Wall-E: ""I am a cinical bastard, but even that little piece of rotten, black glass i call my heart was warmed by this movie"" And i don't even get started on how delicate and clever the symbolism in this animation is. Or on how sarcastic, yet true all the scenes are, which ones are featuring the humans, who became more like a senseless pigs tied to their chair in front of their computer. The whole thing feels so gentle, so classy and uplifting i cant even tell. If humanity will extincts one day and some other intelligent species will find the ruins of our culture i want them to find this movie, and remember us as gentle, warm-hearted, intelligent beings, which we weren't most of the time. And i am not exaggerating. This was really truly this good. At least for me. Sayonara"
"You can read elsewhere the ordinary stuff  about how wonderful this is; about how it exploits cinematic characterization, and even how conservative bloggers have decided to criticize it supposedly leftist premise. (Jees)I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it. There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.But other folks  like me and perhaps you  can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with ""real"" cameras and places.This last movie, ""Ratatouie"" added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story  which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds. And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans  who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't  we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers  yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story. It made it deeper, and more true. Knowing makes love true. So yes, it is effective, and fun, and deep.To compensate, the camera and space manipulation is less radical than usual.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to clean it up while the human race waits in space. Despite being a robot, however, WALL-E has developed a consciousness - he is curious and innocent as a child. Of course, being what seems like the only operational robot left, he also longs for companionship (...someone besides his pet cockroach).That's where EVE comes in, a robot probe sent from the humans in space to check whether or not Earth is again inhabitable. Once WALL-E sees EVE, he becomes smitten and will literally follower her anywhere on Earth... or even space.One can empathize with WALL-E, as he has been alone for what seems like the greater part of 700 years, toiling away at work with nothing but the comforts of his makeshift home to give him some small pleasures and distractions in life (although his morning sluggishness is due to his depleted power, we can't help but relate with those mornings WALL-E finds hard to get out of bed). When he sees the sleek, powerful EVE, it's quite understandable that he is captivated by her.EVE, on the other hand, is completely focused on work (her ""directive""). While we can see her personality come through when she enjoys the freedom of flying around upon her arrival, she is determined to fulfill her mission.The real love story starts to kick in here. The scenes of WALL-E trying to gain EVE's affection are both lovable and laughable. And when WALL-E brings EVE to his home to shelter the storm, he shows EVE all of the various things he collected, much like how a child would show another companion his playthings. EVE's sense of humor comes to light, and we start to see a connection between WALL-E and EVE.Still, when WALL-E shows EVE a plant he picked up, she realizes that her mission is accomplished, so she then ""hibernates"" and beacons the spaceship to pick her up. WALL-E, though, doesn't realize what she has done when she shuts herself down - he is confused, and thinking that she's solar-powered like himself, he brings her outside to the sunlight. His concern and care for her in the rainstorms shine through, and he also dresses her up in lights when he shows her the beautiful sunset she can't see.When the spaceship picks up EVE, WALL-E follows suit, wanting to protect her but still not realizing what is going on. Once they dock on the AXIOM ship, WALL-E gets into more trouble, being a fish out of water.EVE initially looks down on WALL-E - he's, of course, an older model who's job is just a trash compactor. Her attitudes can be seen on Earth where she initially ignores his attempts to gain her attention. Her desire to protect WALL-E arises not from love but more from a sense of noblesse oblige - even though WALL-E would follow EVE anywhere, she tries to make WALL-E understand that he has to go back to Earth alone, echoing WALL-E's interaction with his ever-present pet cockroach back on Earth.When WALL-E is locked in a space capsule that is set to explode, EVE again tries to save WALL-E. Luckily, he was able to get out of the situation himself, and they meet in space. WALL-E used what he learned of a fire extinguisher on Earth (a hilarious scene) to propel him - here, we see EVE and WALL-E as equals in a beautiful dance of flight around the spaceship.More and more, we see EVE start to care deeply for EVE, and it's not only because he's cute and funny but also because he is unselfish and caring. When the captain asks EVE to show recordings of her time on Earth in order to see the state the planet is in, the recording is left on, and EVE then sees the care WALL-E has taken of her during her hibernation. Also, WALL-E risks his life to protect the plant, not because he cares so much the plant but because he knows how much fulfilling her directive means to EVE. He would do anything for EVE, and, in turn, EVE starts to develop the same feelings towards WALL-E.The two endure various calamity to help the spaceship return to Earth, but WALL-E becomes a casualty in the process. EVE finds replacement parts and fixes WALL-E, but he is not the same - he is only focused on his work, a reversal of roles from the beginning of the film. However, EVE holds WALL-E's hands and ""kisses"" him with a spark, and his memory awakens....It's just amazing to me how all of this is conveyed in the storytelling. The characters' expressions and actions are limited to their eyes and gestures of their hands, yet that seems to be more than enough for the artists of the film to express the character's emotions in a visual manner. Each robot can't but say each other's names, yet their bond comes through without any dialogue - in fact, just the tone of their voice when calling each other's names gives all of the information about their intent or feelings at that moment.In any love story, it's not a trivial task to express both sides - oftentimes, unrequited love 'magically' becomes true love after a single event, when the object of the affection suddenly has their eyes opened. On the other hand, WALL-E provides the viewer with a believable love story where both characters come alive and whisk you away in their universe. It's nothing short of extraordinary....Of course, to say that ""WALL-E"" is a perfect love story is a miscategorization, as it offers a perfect blend of comedy, action, and suspense, along with so many other interwoven messages and jewels - it's just a perfect story, period."
"I join the gushing majority and say this is one amazingly done, very touching and important film. 1. A Masterpiece of Computer Graphics & Story TellingWhen computers were still in training pants 25 years ago, I studied, worked with and taught computer graphics. I've often watched an animated film (or live film with injected animation) with knowing appreciation at some use of or advance in computer graphics technology. I have a friend who had been involved managing computer graphics projects for some of the previous Star Wars movies. We have previously discussed the ""state of the art"" and where it's going. The surprise to me in this film wasn't that they could do graphics of this quality now. It was amazement at the scope, effort, skill and creative genius I know it takes to make something so beautiful and moving.Watching the film, my feelings went from astonishment at the graphics to deep empathy and feeling for the main characters. The people around me gasped and say ""wow"" just the same. You don't need experience or friends like mine to tell you that nothing else has come this close to looking so real and gorgeous, to feel so visceral and well-crafted. The use of modern live-action cinematic effects is stunning beyond words. The film's reliance on the intelligence of children and adults to understand the serious thoughts and complex emotions being conveyed, well, is just simply an amazing and reassuring experience. And I thought the closing credit art (using different styles of famous artists) was very cool too.2. Some Small Nitpicks: Most of the time I felt I was watching an exceptionally crafted film with a tight story and a serious message about the current problems of and future prospects for Earth. An then something would happen in the film that would be, like, ""Huh? That doesn't quite make sense or follow, but it's just animation"". I found 2-3 moments where I was shifted from sobering reality to forgivable fantasy, and it was a bit jarring and distracting But these moments can be easily forgotten with the continuation of the next amazing scene.It looks like the quality (time, money, computer horse-power)spent on the main characters is much more than what was spent on depicting the humans. Heck, even the garbage get's more realistic treatment than the people. And then there is the live video of Scott Willard as the ""Executive in Chief"" talking to the planet....The styles don't mesh well for me. I appreciate the thought-line that the humans look more cartoon because of the surreal and clueless nature of their existence on the ship, as well as our inept and greedy custodianship of the planet. I can imagine that the live video is meant to help connect children with the cartoon-nature of certain government officials and the patronizing policies they always on display these days on the evening news. Maybe this is all true, but it's probably also a way to rationalize a limited budget and time schedule. The bottom-line for me that the discrepancies between the treatments didn't work that well for me.Most of the time the characters are so extremely cute and lovable, it's a complement to their creators. But sometimes the cultural cliché's and visual slapstick are a bit much. Overall, it all adds up to a very sweet and moving film, but just a little less ""shtick"" would have been fine by me.Some thoughts on other reviews I've read here:Is the Message Too Heavy-Handed? I don't think so. It's mainly aimed at small kids. They get it, and they take it to heart. Maybe the question should be ""is the message loud enough?"" We earthlings still don't seem to be getting the message. Last I checked, we were still busy polluting the air, water, soil and every life form on the planet...oh, and ruining our climate also. We are feeding our families and enjoying ourselves, but sorry we are each helping to destroy the planet along the way. ""Oh well. It's not like I can make a difference"". Let's just leave the problem for the kids. Good luck kids! Do you think mom and dad are making ""good choices?""It's a moment of truth for us. Are we up to it? Are we truly awake yet and smelling the rising levels of toxicity in our environment? Maybe the message was said softer people would get it more?Regarding those people who have posted negatively, that they couldn't connect, and even thought of walking out...everyone is absolutely entitled to their opinion and to state it. But, gosh, If this film didn't make them gasp at beauty, smile warmly, laugh knowingly...if it didn't put a lump in your throat or make an eye or two teary, then...that's just sad, and even a bit scary.If you haven't seen this film yet, run and see it on the big screen while you can. I think you will enjoy taking some kids. You will see them enthralled and fully-attuned to the message. It's a good thing."
"In the Twentieth-Eighth Century, Earth is completely depleted and with the ecological system destroyed. The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter  Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old ""Hello Dolly"" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.""WALL-E"" is one of the best animations I have ever seen, with adorable characters and a deep story, showing a possible scenario of the depletion of our planet caused by the lack of concern from the big corporations with the environment. In addition, there is the beautiful love story of WALL-E, the importance of small and forgotten things; a great nostalgia of the old times among many other message. The story is very well developed in spite of having very few dialogs. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""WALL-E"""
"The stunning virtual world of Wall.E shows Pixar at the top of their creative graphic powers. Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale. I'm guessing the target audience for this movie is somewhere around 6th graders. Great summer family fare but not a great movie if you want something more substantial in terms of plot and character development."
"I went in to this movie with very high expectations, having anticipated it since I saw the first previews. Pixar blew me through the roof. From the opening star-scape with ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"" playing cheerily in the background, to the closing credits, this movie is in an utter masterpiece. There's never a dull moment in this beautiful film. The audience is taken through such a vast range of emotions, ranging from the pure joy of discovery, to the near-hopeless sense of defeat. Director Andrew Stanton has done it again, adding WALL-E on top of his previous Pixar success, Finding Nemo. Nemo was originally my favorite Pixar film. But then along came this little robot, who tore my heartstrings clear out of my chest and took his rightful place at the top of my favorite films list."
"My favorite animated movie was, and still is The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Wall-E comes in at close second. Pixar outdid themselves in every possible way, and it seems that though they've done that with each of their films, this one stands above the others. It's cute, without those lame sappy moments that cause you to uncomfortably stare at the floor. It's emotional, with some scenes even leaving a lump in my throat. The animation is amazing and the story is both inventive and original (for the most part). Wall-E is the quintessential Pixar film...no, it's the quintessential animated movie.Wall-E (or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth class) is a lonely robot on futuristic Earth. The year is around 2800 and all the humans have ""temporarily"" been taken off of Earth into a space cruise where they are awaiting Earth to be cleaned up. Wall-E's only friend is a cockroach, and he lives in a little storage shelter where he keeps interesting items he finds in the trash he compacts. One day a spaceship drops off another robot, this one named EVE. Her mission is to find plant life on Earth, which would signal that the humans can return. Wall-E is fascinated by EVE, and more than anything just wants to hold her hand, like in his favorite musical, Hello Dolly. EVE sees a plant that Wall-E had previously found, and they both end up being taken up into space on the space cruise ship. All the humans on board have lost track of reality, don't walk or do any exercise, and they are all morbidly obese. Wall-E and EVE end up having to save the plant life they brought up to show to the ship's captain so they can go back to Earth, but the ship computer doesn't like that idea.I have no critiques for this film. As I've said, this is about as close to perfect as you can come, I'll just explain what I really liked. I enjoyed the romance between Wall-E and EVE, which was so sweet, sort of sad at times, and more real than the typical teen comedy romance. The human characters were great. Jeff Garlin plays the ship captain and does an excellent job. One of the best scenes in the movie has the captain studying up on Earth wide eyed, learning all the things humans (now adays) have known since we were infants. John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy voice two humans who face reality before the others and get off their fat rears to have some fun and take a moment to notice the stars. The animation is the best Pixar's ever done, and even with the cartoonish designs of the characters, sometimes I'd forget I was watching a cartoon. Wall-E, as a character, was an amazing lead. Amazing in that he carried the movie flawlessly, and made me truly feel for the poor guy, and amazing in that the only thing that he says in the movie, along with some grunts and squeals, is ""EVE-a!"". I have no clue how Pixar molds these likable characters, but they did a fantastic job. I'd see it 10 more times in the theaters, and I hope it makes a billion at the box office.Pixar's done it again! They hit gold, more so than any of their other pictures, and Wall-E ranks up there with one of the best animated pictures of all time. It was the first film in months to leave me 100% satisfied. I loved it! My rating: **** out of ****. 100 mins. Rated G."
"Boy, the visuals were as stunning as I had read they were; absolutely spectacular. I hate to use this cliché, but this is a ""must"" for Blu-Ray fans. You have to see - and hear - this film in HD because it is a great treat for your senses. The surround sounds are everywhere while the colors and artwork are something to behold! And, yes - it's still very pretty on a regular DVD, too.The story is ""cute,"" but nowhere near the visuals and audio. It's okay, subtlety humorous, dramatic and romantic parts. It gets a tiny bit preachy with the usual environmental digs and a comment about how fat we humans can get by lying around too much, but otherwise just plays it for comedy and cool-looking characters. Everyone and everything in this film is pretty amazing-looking.It's kind of a strange story, with much of it taking place on a big space ship. My favorite parts were in the beginning on Earth with the little robot WALL-E and his cockroach friend.There is so much to see in this film, it makes multiple viewings all the more attractive but, I'll assume, you're always going to catch some things you didn't see the first few times. Overall, not a super story but yet an amazing film, one that is one you want to show off your Blu-Ray DVD player to friends. This sets yet another new standard in animation."
"Pixar and Disney have done it again! This is an historic piece of film-making and an example of what can happen when a studio like Pixar continually refuses to compromise making the best film possible....every time...and we're talking nine times now in a row!!! This movie works as kid's movie, a science fiction film, a romantic comedy, and for much of it...a silent film. It had a great message but was not preachy. It had stunning visuals throughout. My expectations were so high for this film...and yet they were far exceeded by the geniuses at Pixar...I don't know how they do it. This movie makes up for the disappointment I felt after seeing the latest Indiana Jones installment. Spielberg and Lucas, I have a ""directive"" for you. Take your kids to see WALL-E immediately, and definitely take notepad!!!Overall Score: 9.2/10"
"No problem! Finally an animated movie that dares to be.... animated! Pixar has set a new standard in digital animation. I say digital, because I'd still like to see more traditional hand drawn films. You don't need recognizable voices coming out of animals that resemble them. You don't need cheesy jokes or failed one liners. No musical cues to band either. I don't think I'll be able to watch a computer animated movie for a long time, I'll compare to this for a while. Pixar was not in this for the cheap quick cash in, they made a movie, that I think, will stand the test of time. I can tell people will be watching this for years and years, like Fantasia."
"I saw Wall-E at a special sneak preview. I'm not a Pixar fanboy. I've enjoyed a number of their movies, but this is first I've seen at the theater.Wall*e was an enjoyable diversion. The titular character is robot that has spent his many days performing his task in isolation. All the other robots have worn out over time. Wall*e is different in that he is a survivor. In the many years he has worked, he has evolved a sense of self. Unfortunately, that involves a feeling of loneliness. After a significant event, it is resolving this loneliness that becomes his quest.The stars of the shows are the various robots. Their emotions are inferred through their actions, grunts, clicks and the occasional verbalization. This however is not a limitation. Pixar has created characters you care about. Wall*e is a hero in the tradition of Danny Kaye. He is a simple guy with simple ambitions that just happen to coincide with the events in the movie. He isn't glory seeking, he just wants companionship in the sappiest Disney tradition. It is this purity of soul that is his most endearing quality.This more of a kid's film that past Pixar efforts and the hand of Disney is firmly felt. There are sweeping scenes that designed to evoke adolescent dreams and emotions. That is not to say adults won't find it enjoyable. Pixar takes shot at a couple of themes; Consumerism, the environment, even some mild political humor. There are even a couple of gags relating to cockroaches and Twinkies which have oft been repeated. However, it lacks some of the sly adult wit that some of the previous films had.There little highbrow comedy here. Most of the gags come from slapstick pratfalls and such. However, the gags are executed with such precision, and the characters are so compelling that they were very effective. The rest of the humor consists of sight gags. Most not rising to the point past a chuckle, but taken as whole weaves a rich tapestry of the world that Wall-E lives in.Adults will find it enjoyable. Kids will love it beyond words and you're going to have to buy them Wall-E dolls for Christmas."
"I just returned from a midnight showing of WALL-E, and all I can say is 'amazing'. Pixar have clearly outdone themselves, producing what is sure to be one of their best films ever. All the characters have personality, and there are no throwaway characters. Every character that is introduced in the story has their own unique personality, and it really shows how hard Pixar worked on the movie.The movie serves as both a sci-fi futuristic love comedy, and also a warning to humanity. We've got to take care of our planet now, because as charming as the movie was, I personally would not like to see those events transpire here, 700 years in the future or any other time.I would give this movie an 11 if I could. It is an absolutely brilliant piece of cinema and one that should not be missed. If you're a parent, take your kids. Even if you don't have kids, go see this movie, it's fun and lighthearted and will make you laugh out loud several times over.A+ Pixar, I can't wait to see what they cock up next."
"""Wall-E,"" the latest offering from the movie-making geniuses at Pixar Studios, is a certifiable visual masterpiece that provides an endlessly inventive vision of what life might be like in the 29th Century - although, come to think of it, the term ""life"" may be something of a misnomer, for in ""Wall-E""'s post-apocalyptic image of the future, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution and garbage that have risen to toxic levels. The humans have long since fled to a high-tech way station located somewhere out in the far reaches of outer space, leaving the planet virtually deserted except for a sweet trash-compressing robot named Wall-E and his indestructible cockroach sidekick. Like all good little robots, Wall-E tirelessly performs the one function he has been programmed to carry out, even after the reason for that task no longer exists. Thus, he spends his days dutifully collecting all the litter generously strewn about the deserted city and converting it into skyscraper-high mounds of compacted trash. At night, he wiles away the hours watching an old videotape of ""Hello Dolly"" and pining away for a female companion who will alleviate his loneliness and bring some meaning to his life. Then, one fine day, his dream becomes a reality when a sleek, sexy little number named Eve - actually an environmental robot sent from the way station to see if any signs of life have returned to the planet - shows up unexpectedly in Wall-E's neighborhood.The early section of the movie, in which Wall-E wordlessly goes about his business against a haunting backdrop of a decaying infrastructure and heaps of garbage, has much of the delicate beauty and sense of wonder we find in the opening moments of ""E.T."" (whose main character obviously served as the model for Wall-E). Written and directed by Andrew Stanton and brought to life by an army of miracle-working animators too numerous to mention, ""Wall-E"" is one of those rare films that, through sheer visual design alone, is able to magically transport us to the unique little world it's created. The burgeoning romance between the two mechanical creatures is handled with a great deal of tenderness and wit, and the film is sprinkled with subtle little homages to ""West Side Story"" (in the aerial views of the city), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Titanic"" for the more cinematically astute among us to revel and delight in. In the second half of the movie, ""Wall-E"" travels to the spaceship housing the colony of ex-patriot earthlings, where he encounters problems with a sophisticated computer who wants to control the humans and prevent them from returning to a planet that just may be becoming inhabitable once again.This is a sweet and wistful fable about not only how each individual must find his own special place in the universe but how we as a species must cherish and preserve this one special place we all call home. Yet, for all its rare and wonderful qualities, I wish I could say that I loved this movie more than I do. For like some of Pixar's other products, ""Wall-E"" is more impressive in its visuals than in its storytelling. Too often in ""Wall-E"" we feel as if the narrative is lagging a few paces behind all the technical ingenuity. Indescribably beautiful as it is to look at, the movie doesn't generate sufficient conflict and drama to pull us all the way into the story. And for that reason, ""Wall-E,"" while a true cornucopia of visual delights and easily one of the most spectacular-LOOKING films ever made, still falls just a hairsbreadth short of greatness when all is said and done."
"My reaction to the early TV trailers for WALL-E was ""ok, another Pixar movie. No biggie."" Consider, though I've seen almost every Pixar movie (girlfriend renting them on DVD) my reactions ranged from ""mildly amused"" to ""cute, but mostly CGI eye-candy"". Of course, as a thirty-something male, I never assumed Pixar movies were targeted to my demographic in the first place. ""Pixar is for kids"", after all, right? Then one day a 5-minute sneak peak was shown on TV featuring WALL-E and Eve (scene where he gets stuck in space capsule with plant). During those 5 minutes, the essence of WALL-E's character took hold and never let go. My girlfriend and I decided we wouldn't be able to wait any longer than opening day to see it. Embarrassing to admit, but I go the theater twice in a year at most, and yet I actually bought our WALL-E tickets 2 weeks in advance.Having seen the movie today, he's honestly no less than the most adorable and brilliant animated character of all time. His personality and mannerisms spread themselves like sunlight - turning even the coldest of hearts to liquid, and bursting preconceptions to dust. Until now, no character (fictional or otherwise) ever managed to awaken the kid in me with the old notion ""I wish this character was real so I could take it home with me"". The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders. All of the film's characters other than WALL-E are really just props, like arrows pointing your attention back at him, and always when it's the last thing he would want. His plant also seems symbolic of him (and that will make sense after you've seen the movie).All that aside, the graphics are brilliant, especially the WALL-E character, in that it looks like a real physical robot shot on film. Great care was taken on subtleties like focus/defocus and depth perception to make him look real-world, all *within* a real-world (especially the scenes during which he's alone on earth).I wish it would've been longer, but only because like all great rides, it went by fast and eventually had to have an end. Can't wait to see it again."
"This is the story of Wall-E a robot who is alone working on earth cleaning up the polluted planet. One day he finds a plant and takes it home. When one day a space ship lands Wall-E meets EVE who has been left on the planet for some reason. The reason is to find signs that plants are returning, so when Wall-E shows EVE the planet she sends a signal for pick up and is whisked back to a space ship where all of mankind has been living-with Wall-E in pursuit.This is a mostly wordless feature film not only about robots who fall in love but also what it means to be human and what it means to be alive. Its also a satire, of sorts, about the fat lazy people that we in the West have become.Technically this is one of the most beautifully animated films that Pixar has done. Its wonderful to look at. The places and spaces and the characters are all beautifully rendered. The film creates more than good number of real characters, both robots and people and its the characters that make the film worth seeing.The problem is that the story is a bit of a mess. On the one hand you have the central story of the romance of Wall-E and EVE, but you also have this glaring social commentary looming over everything. From the polluted Earth of the first half to the fat people in space during the second. Which is more important? To me its the romance and its there that the film shines. Frankly I got teary during any number of sequences dealing with the romance. Unfortunately the ""get the plant so we can go home story"" kind of goes nowhere smoothly as situation keeps being inserted again and again to keep it going. On top of that we have the not so hidden messages about how lazy we all are and how happiness is ""not following the path"". The story goes from well told story about Wall-e and Eve to the Captain (who is wonderful and under utilized-I wanted more of him) to the two human ""lovers"" John and Mary who begin to see life out side of their hoover-chairs.There is this really good robot romance stuck in here thats gotten lost somewhere along the way. I was sobbing during the four minute trailer that was floating around a few months ago that focused beautifully on the romance. I went from not being sure if it would work to being sure they hit it out of the park. There's this wonderful simple story locked in there with all this not as wonderful stuff around it. (A word of warning- the trailers give a good number of gags away) Yes I've complain about every Pixar Movie. (Toy Story 2 isn't as good as the first one, Bugs Life is too slow, Monsters Inc was not quite Toys Story, Nemo didn't completely thrill me, Incredibles is too long, Cars is too simple and their eyes wig me out, Ratatouille, while very good, isn't the the great second coming many claimed) Say What you will I own all but A Bugs Life. Other than Cars I think all have improved with time (thanks to the critical claim that this Pixar is the next big thing no loner being considered) And while I do think Ratatouille has too much story and needs to be trimmed down, I don't think that any of them have as many problems story wise as this (certainly none has as many character needing exploration and fleshing out).What is this film about-really I don't know. I adore the romance and wish I had someone to take to see it since its so charming, but at the same time...I don't know it all doesn't come together for me.Perhaps I could see some of the story line too clearly. I could tell what the next shot was or the next motion would be. Perhaps I saw too many jokes in the trailers and commercials. Maybe it was the god awful Hello Dolly clip playing over and over and over. Maybe it was the one movie too many that played Le Vie En Rose. I don't know. there is something about the film that doesn't allow it to hang together for me. I admire its construction but I don't love the result.I still like it. I'd give it between 6.5 to 7 out of 10, but at the same time the parts are better then the whole.Go see it and make up your own mind-if nothing else there are some really neat things in it."
"Many are complaining about the hypocritical message that Disney/Pixar is offering by making a movie about the evils of commercialism and capitalism and then marketing it and its products. On that point they've missed the mark because it's not about the evils of commercialism and capitalism, it's about gluttony and what can happen when you stop paying attention. I think the movie itself is a representation of this, don't get distracted by Wall-E's charm, Eve's streamlined features, and the ever mesmerizing animation. Instead pause and remember the film is trying to offer you something besides entertainment. If you just sit there and let the film wash over you, you've only had a pleasurable experience (not unlike a smooth hover chair ride). But if you engage with Wall-E, Eve, the captain and their struggles you can take away more from the theatre, you'll need to get out of your hover chair to do it though and actually take a good look at the stars outside. Secondly environmentalism, capitalism, commercialism, monopolies, and so forth were not the only topics addressed in this film. I felt undercurrents of both self-discovery and appreciation for others uniqueness. Wall-E apparently already wasn't quite like other robots. He's curious, inventive, and protective. However Wall-E doesn't learn what he's really made of until he takes his journey into space to ""save"" Eve. There he proves that he's not only loyal and creative but also courageous, tenacious, and friendly. This rounds out his character as a hero and one that changes over the course of the story even though he was designed with a single purpose. Eve is purposeful, career-oriented, and a little bit dangerous. She does her job well and defines herself by her directives. Through her journey she expands her programming by learning what friends can and will do for one another. She learns other things are sometimes more important than carry out your duties. No more clearly does she learn this lesson then at the end of the film when the Wall-Eness of Wall-E seems to have disappeared. I feel this is also the point in the film that drives home the message of self-discovery and individuality. Without that certain spark, Wall-E is just like all the other Wall-Es around him. Finally there is the captain. No one knows how he got his position on the ship but however it happened his position merely has the illusion of power. From the trailers I thought the captain was going to be the villain of the story, but he is a good guy and he too goes on a journey of growth and exploration. It seems he is just like the other humans, but instead he proves himself to be capable of bettering himself through self-starting education and changing the way he functions on a daily basis. Though he remains somewhat a bumbling character throughout the film he does the right thing and passes his newfound knowledge and hope onto the other humans. On that note stick around until the credits start scrolling on black. The story doesn't end when the computer animation does. This story was told mostly without words so when the other sound effects leave the screen don't assume the message ends. At that point the purest form of film is left: story through images. I think the negative reviewers forgot that too."
"DO NOT listen to those who say this is a bad movie because there's hardly any dialog. Everything in this movie is so perfect, it doesn't NEED dialog!! The animation was so REAL. Everything was perfect!! The landscapes were beautiful, the technology was creative, smooth, and incredibly flawless, the robots were great! I thought it was interesting how real humans were used in small parts of the movie, and the humans in the future were animated, shown as really large, lazy people we may become in the future, if we're not careful. As soon as the movie started, I fell in love with Wall-e. He was possible the most adorable thing I have ever seen! His character was so deep, you could forget he's not human. Wall-e has the biggest heart of any of the characters I've seen. You have to be insane to not love Wall-e. I really enjoyed seeing the chemistry develop between EVE and Wall-e. They are so different, EVE being a fast, powerful, advanced robot, and Wall-e being a sweet, simple, rusty little trash-compacting robot, and they work together PERFECTLY!!! They are the cutest couple in Pixar history. The messages in the story were very well-presented. It showed what could happen to our planet if we trashed it and took it for granted and what could happen if we all get too lazy. The perfect combination of humor, CGI, heart, and lessons to be learned, this is truly a Pixar triumph."
"The odd title is actually an acronym: Waste Allocation Lift Loader, Earth-Class. This little robot unit is the last of a series originally intended to clean up a massively polluted Earth while humankind left the planet for a temporary five years which, after the failure of the project, has resulted in an absence of 700 years. The pacing and atmosphere of the movie would be remarkable for any work, let alone one of animation, with a long opening scene with little action and no dialogue. Even when another robot EVE arrives from outer space and a technical romance ensues, the dialogue is minimalist but the action accelerates at a exciting and satisfying pace.Pixar have here given us outstanding work and Andrew Stanton, who conceived the story and directed the film, deserves special praise. The film is entertaining with action, humour and great visuals, but its is also subtly instructive with clear messages about the damage to the planet and to our bodies from our adoration of consumerism, making it appealing to children and adults alike. Many science fiction classics - from ""2001"" to ""Silent Running"" - are referenced, but the treatment is so original that ""WALL·E"" itself is destined to be a classic."
"Having won the PR war, there is now no means by which a viewer can allow himself to judge a Pixar product as wanting or in this case, horrid. A movie so underscripted (and over messaged) that if you wasted five words describing the plot you'd give everything away. Audiences still don't know when they're being narratively cheated, or when a slightly promising idea has gone off the rails, or become a bloated, maddening mess. I never ever imagined when I rented this that I would be swearing at the screen as the unbearable latter two thirds of this movie wore out their welcome.So here we are (AGAIN) with the unpromising clichés of a robot who wants to feel love, a ships computer issuing a self-destruct countdown, a crowd that requires one person to save them.Wall-e himself makes sad eyes over and over. The movie milks this in every scene - Put ""robot"" and ""love"" into the big Hollywood script writing machine and you always get something like this. The movie becomes bloated with surface activity whose conception calls for dragging out tired computer animation, and the familiar set of unnecessary/lookalike obstacles to be overcome. It devolves into the usual thought (and time) wasters. In the end, things have reached the same frantic, overproduced excess that execs have been pushing for 50 years. Wall-E is exactly as bloated as Hello Dolly was in 1969. (& I challenge you to sit through that forgotten dud.)In the 1968 movie Oliver, at an emotional bottom, the title moppet sings a song called ""Where is love?"" Lionel Bart was criticized for writing a song with sentiments too developed for a child to voice. While a child may seek the love a missing parent, they don't seek love in general as a disembodied ideal. Likewise for Wall-e. Here, barely three minutes after Wall-E is introduced, he's dreary little headcase pining for love, which is a limp idea dramatically for a kids film, and forces half the problems that ensue. The other half come from the wearying agenda, and this is coming from someone who is relieved we are finally in the green era.Vain, high-concept viewers have taken pride in their ignorance of a device here, which is old news; large stretches of silence are novel only to audiences who are unfamiliar with Jaques Tati, the 28 silent minutes that open 2001, enormous silent stretches of the ingenious Blow-Up (& countless other examples) and who can't fathom the silent era.The movie asks two tiny things of an audience; to nod in agreement with its simpleton moral pronouncements, and to pass the time distracted by a bunch of surface activity. Right in the middle, between those two things, is where any good movies soul resides, what the movie ask you to cogitate over; ideas! Sorry no ideas here, just an abundance of messages: Towers of garbage taller than the skyscrapers we built (check, message delivered) An indictment of bignesss and Wal-mart (check, message delivered) Headed by a craven CEO (check, message delivered) A single remaining plant (check, messaged delivered) A space-ark filled with helpless fatties (check, message delivered) etc. etc. etc. etc. (message delivered).A glimpse into the future has never been so hopelessly stuck in the narrative past, and never looked so much like Victorian corn. The movie just cannot rest until a parade of morals has been pounded home. There is little sense of wonder in it. It ain't surprising that it was directed by the guy who made Little Nemo.The movie becomes exactly as dreary, tiring and preachy as the premise of a largely wordless movie about ecology sounds. It does not overcome its major decisions. Regardless of it's popularity now, no one will be watching this in ten years because no one will be able to trudge through it. It is grotesquely unsubtle hideously preachy.Wall-E is is as insufferable as a dinner guest who explains the correct moral stance on every topic that comes up. Message delivered."
"I decided to add my voice because this film is highly rated and I have never found myself at such odds with the majority of the IMDb audience.Spoiler at end.I read enough to see that I have nothing to add concerning its technical achievement, obviously well done.I am an avid science fiction fan (books and film) so I agree with those who find this story weak. I went because I wanted to know why this film was so highly rated across all the demographic areas although I had my doubts based on the preview.Apparently many do not agree with me but I would like to caution others that if you look forward to thought provoking ideas and having your preconceived notions challenged you will be disappointed. Even younger audiences may become bored after 1/2 hour although the visual stimulation may be sufficient.My background includes special effects in film and computer program development so I naturally appreciate the films technical prowess. But I also know well almost all the science fiction films made to date including those with serious as well as comic presentations and WALL-E does not rate well for me when compared to them.WALL_E missed being sufficiently provocative or amusing so I found it bland. The film, however, was much better portraying the emotional connections between the two main characters which is quite an achievement considering WALL-E was a garbage disposal unit who apparently developed over a long period of time a more than human heart (think of your feelings for roaches).Spoiler follows: The ideas of planet ruin via garbage and humans becoming fat, technologically catered to, isolated in space, and thus unmotivated beings after 700 years is interesting but each of these is not original and I, at this time, cannot clearly describe why the film failed to engage me. Perhaps with such a future there should be more angst."
"I was ready to be wowed by this film and the first 20 minutes or so were ecstatic for me. Sometimes I think there's no comparison between Japanese anime and the stuff Hollywood puts out, but this was clearly inspired and ingenious film making that can hold its own against Japan's best. But then the film has trouble dealing with the problems it poses, not unlike how we're failing to deal with the REAL problems of over consumption and the mindless accumulation of waste that it alludes to. The setting changes and the story takes a rather depressing turn into frenetic activity that made me anxious to see it over. It's not that the film's point is misguided or even over sold. It's just that it's a different issue and not necessarily a consequence of the first more successfully contrived part. That second issue is our becoming overly serviced by robots in a blind pursuit of entertainment and sensation. Still, the creation of a robot with a completely engaging personality is so brilliant and indelible that no one should miss this somewhat mixed film. Clearly the people who made this have their head's on straight and have a better vision of what could result from our culture than some of our most highly respected leaders."
"Nothing much to say, really, about the animation. PIXAR steps it up another notch. Simply stunning, which is par for the course for PIXAR. I gave the film six stars and at least five of them go to the visuals.However, the story didn't really match those visuals. And the two robot leads were cute, I'll grant, but not much more than that.SPOILERS FOLLOW.Basically, humans created the mess that made it necessary for them to leave the planet. And we're supposed to root for them to come back? I'm sorry, I just don't get it. It's not a strong enough reason for me to root for the protagonists. And the antagonists are, likewise, not compelling enough, with no real apparent motivation for keeping the humans from re-inhabiting earth, unless it's to protect the earth from humans overloading the world with trash again, in which case, I'm not sure we shouldn't have rooted for them instead.And what about the other species? We see fish in the end credits. Presumably, the planet was okay for them and other species? The movie doesn't really go into that, unless I missed something.Meanwhile, while the humans were away, they came to rely on being carted around on hover-chairs. As the film explains, this leads to some bone loss. And their ability to walk has apparently atrophied over the centuries. Only it hasn't, as we see the uniformly obese humans learn to walk again, much like overgrown infants learn to walk. Perhaps this is meant to be symbolic, but it doesn't make a lot of logical sense.Finally, I'm not sure why a live action Fred Willard was used, but this is a minor point. Given the rest of the movie, I find that I really don't care. I just find it a little odd."
"PIXAR has made a long string of good movies. With the weakest being CARS, witch still was a good movie (just not perfection/near perfection like the rest) could there reputation hold up to the next movie.Do we need oxygen to live? I can't think of a bad part in this movie. There are some scientific errors beyond basic sci-fi, but the movie is good enough to look past them. The little dialog beyond some robot designating things such as ""Target"" or ""Foreign substance"" and a few commercials. One particular thing I enjoyed was when a space craft was passing the moon, you could see the Armstrong landing sight. Next to it was an add for a BUY-N-LARGE superstore.The animation was flawless. If I was looking at the images minus the people and some robots (not all however)I would swear it was live action.The sounds are going to win an Oscar. The music will be nominated (though I doubt it will win) I really doubt any movie will beat this for best animated feature film 2008. I wouldn't be surprised if it got nominated for best screenplay. I will defiantly by the DVD. So I have to wait till about November/December."
"So yeah, this is a pretty good movie. It's something that the everyone in the family can enjoy; and is well worth the 9 bucks I paid to see it.However......this movie probably shouldn't be in the top 250, let alone top 25. It's not even Pixar's best. Both of the two Toy Stories, AND Finding Nemo are better movies! They may not surpass WALL-E in animation, but they are better, and more original stories. Even the animation doesn't leave me in awe as it does so many others on IMDb apparently. It is repetitive, and lacks style in a way. An example would be ""scared"" WALL-E (even if you haven't seen the movie, you've seen it in previews). He just shakes! That would be OK, except he does it 3 or 4 times in the movie! Do something different! To add to that, both the story and music is basically stolen. 2001: a space odyssey, star trek, star wars; all stolen from."
"From Curious George to E.T. and right on down to the present day, cinema-goers have always had a strong affinity towards, for lack of a better term, ""curious little critters"", small animals, aliens or other beings who are simultaneously inquisitive and clueless about the ways of Earth, and are preferably also quite clumsy, and Wall-E, as a character and as a movie, delivers in spades. Taking a pratfall as effortlessly as Keaton, and doing a terrified double take better than the most racist of cinema servitude, the sentient being, whose job it is to pick up and compact trash on a desolate future Earth, is equally fascinated by the inner workings of lightbulbs, Twinkies, garbage can lids and iPods, but can't seem to cover his head, as countless manner of things continually seem to be crashing down upon it. This mundane existence is shattered by a mysterious craft that deploys a scanning probe, another sentient being, this time with an infectious giggle and an itchy trigger finger, named Eve.Pixar has an uncanny knack for turning familiarity into universiality. Case in point: the love story presented in ""WALL-E"" is a story that doesn't take a single turn that hasn't been preordained by 80 years of cinema history, but Pixar still manages to turn it on its ear: The love story here is between robots, and our protagonists, despite only having model numbers and call signs for names, and literally knowing four words between them (two, discounting their own names), are more human than any couple seen on the silver screen in some time, and when life and responsibility intervene, there's a sense of heartbreak and loss seldom possible with flesh and blood.The second act takes us as far in the other direction as possible, as Eve is picked back up by her ship, and Wall-E hitches a ride on the side, desperate for his only love. The scenes of travel here function as both a sort of montage, a transition between acts, but also serve to provide the audience with what may be the most awe-inspiring presentation of space seen since ""2001"", which also gets an immediately recognizable character nod that could work as a gap to that film when they're older. What he finds when the ship arrives is a completely autonomous society, co-existing between morbidly obese humans on floating chairs, no longer required to do anything of effort, even communicating on viewscreens directly across from each other, coexisting with all manner of robotic denizens, who have far more of the human experience than their living counterparts, including frustrated custodians, tough-as-nails security officers and even a mental health ward.I won't take the time to explain the particulars of the humans' situation, or any more of the plot, because part of the fun is exploring for yourself. Pixar has never been one to skimp on the details, and every inch of the screen is filled with glorious colors, wondrous intricacies and charming touches that just add to the amazing glory unfolding before you. The fact that you know what's going to happen is less of a detriment and more of a comfort, much like watching a old video of your favorite sports' team's greatest triumph: You may know all the ups and down, but on screen, it's always happening for the first time, and damnit, it feels that way too, a testament to the skill, expertise and above all HEART, something Pixar has always seemed to possess just a little bit more of than everybody else, like they discovered some hidden secret on how to entertain everybody, to transcend labels like ""children's movie"", ""animated movie"" or even ""family movie"", to where all you have to say is ""Pixar"", and the inference is there: You're going to love it, and Pixar has stepped up to say, ""Don't give up on 2008 just yet."" As for ""WALL-E"", the message is clear: All you need is love (All together now!). All you need is love (Everybody!). All you need is love, love...Love is all you need.{Grade: 9.5/10 (A) / #1 (of 53) of 2008 / #187 of all time}"
"Watched Wall-E this weekend with my five year old son, an avid movie watcher. With all the hype it is hard not to go into this movie with high expectations. Yet after the first half hour of the film I did feel this was not living up to these high hopes. For me, I love the work of Brad Bird, I think it's physical and very human and clicks along at a fair pace, and although they don't make you think deeper about your life, you still have a great time watching them. As with all Pixar movies the visual work is excellent and earthy tones used on Earth are beautiful. The problem really is with the pacing and the pretty obvious plot of the story. Even my son half way through asked how long to go, and this seemed to be the general state of many of the children in the audience. I don't want to add spoilers because you're figure it out pretty quickly anyway. For me this is a date movie or even a 'chick flick' so beware parents it may be a bumpy ride. But I could have been tired!"
"I love animation. I love Pixar. I love the character of Wall-E, and enjoyed the relationship with EVE. Is the animation amazing looking? Sure. Not as great as last years wonderful little rat movie or even as enthralling as Finding Nemo, but still an achievement and better than what most other studios can even dream of.But There was about 15 minutes of story here. Maybe 20. Much like a silent film of the past which doesn't hold up to today's standards, Wall-E just wears thin after a while. Yawning was contagious in parts, as was seat squirming. I've only experienced that once before at a Pixar film, Cars. Which also had a very shallow story, BTW.Wall-E felt longer than it was, never a good sign for a film. That they can carry a film that long with almost no dialog is amazing, but the pacing could have been stronger. But frankly, what you watch is a very compelling character basically run around in a video game environment. It's as if the whole movie was created just so it could be put onto an Xbox. ""This is the garbage collections stage."" ""Now that you cleared that, here's an interstitial story element."" ""Now this is the run away from EVE stage."" ""Now the run away from the guard robot stage."" ""Now the run away from cleaner robot stage."" ""More guard robots, different floor"" Etc. And watching someone play a video game is just not that exciting. How many chase scenes does one movie need? If you thought the end of Monsters Inc. was overly long due to the drawn out chase, you ain't seen nothing until you sit through the 40 minutes of chases in Wall-E.A technically distracting problem was the mixing of LIVE ACTION footage of Fred Willard and Hello Dolly with animated humans. It made no sense from a visual standpoint, and I really don't know what Lasseter was thinking here letting this idea get into the final film. Why Fred Willard wasn't animated like everyone else is just beyond comprehension.Another major problem with the movie is that Wall-E doesn't matter much to the story. He is not concerned with getting from A-B, which is kind of important. Without giving too much away, Wall-E is only interested in making EVE his girlfriend, which means that the ""mission"" that he is put on is not important to him. Which means he has no stake in the outcome. He doesn't care if it succeeds or fails other than it would please the girl robot, and even then, she doesn't really care either. And the resolution is full of deus ex machina moments. All of which reinforce the video game feel of the movie, where it's about clearing levels and completing tasks rather than a uniquely compelling story.In addition to the lack of a layered story and main character who has any stake, the environmental message was heavy handed and logically flawed to the point of being laughable. Goes far beyond the most outspoken doom and gloom propaganda you've ever heard. And it's not an ironic extreme, it's just a stupid one. The opening of the film was annoying in it's stupidity, no matter how well crafted it was. (The wall-mart bashing was similarly stupid, but at least that was more ironic.) But in terms of the trash and the air, humans could not have survived on the earth they left long enough to create the technology to leave it if it was in that condition. And no matter what some would like you to believe, it would be impossible to reach that state in less than 100 years. Not to mention that if humans create a giant biosphere to live in until they fix the earth, why do they fly off into a far off solar system it it? There is no need. Just create it ON earth. Self-contained is self- contained. And this shouldn't matter at all except it is a film aimed at children (and simple minded adults) with the goal of indoctrinating them into an extremist way of looking at the world, and specifically the USA (the world was deserted, but there was no mention of any city or country other than the USA). And I truly believe that the reason so many critics liked this film so much was this last point. It was anti-USA, anti-business, and environmentally alarmist, and fits perfectly with the Hollywood and media agenda of the last 15 years. I really respected Pixar for not falling into the ""message film"" trap, but I guess that combining Pixar management with Disney brought some of that influence into the fold, which is a bad thing for all of us."
"I can't believe wall e's on the IMDb top 250 list, and that too at no. 29 when i write this.The film is strictly average. Agreed, that the theme is a little unconventional, and a little refreshing at first, but it soon becomes run-of-the-mill. The way the romance between the two robots has been depicted is contrived and plain irritating. All the two robots can say, are their names, and that too, in highly pitched, irritating sounds. Wall e's urge to grab eve's hand is just unnatural for a robot, and very awkward.The first half of the movie, when the interactions between wall e and the cockroach are shown, is interesting, but the second half of the film is cheesy, clichéd, and boring. As usual, you have the good robots, and the bad robots, and wall e defies all odds and emerges the hero. I mean, how unexpected is that.The only thing about this movie that stays with you after you've left the theater, is a headache from the incessant cries of 'wall e!' and 'eve!' from the two robots.6/10, that too because of the brilliant animation."
"When Pixar's not sucking on the Disney Empire's sinister teat or filling landfills with discarded kitsch packaged in slow-to-biodegrade plastic and made by suicidal kids in China at environment destroying mega-factories...they're making eco-cautionary, anti corporatist films. In this regard we had the clean energy advocating ""Monster's Inc"" and ""Cars 2"", and the eco-loving, anti-consumerist, anti-corporate ""WALL-E"". Pixar's other films have a stranger tension, ""Cars"" decrying urban sprawl, gas guzzlers and life in the fast-lane by celebrating retro-cars, speedy races and old-school, ""good"", ""small town capitalism"", whilst the ""Toy Story"" movies yearn for the tactile, nostalgic pleasures of solid-state toys even as Pixar's dependence on pixels, processors and Pentiums pulverises whatever pull pre-digital entertainment ever had. Want to play with Mr Potato Head, honey? Screw that, Mom. Hit me some X-box. Now! Disney once performed a similar magic trick, making billions off public domain material whilst militantly copyrighting the same material (Disney lobbies were behind the drive to extend copyrights to a full century), aggressively suing everyone from the Academy Awards to daycare centres who dared place Snow Whites and Quasimodos in classrooms or playgrounds.Directed by Andrew Stanton, ""WALL-E"" revolves around a cute robot called WALL-E. He's (why do we assume WALL-E's male?) a cross between ET and ""Short Circuit's"" Johnny 5, with big robot eyes and a perpetually sad, puppy-dog look. When he's not mimicking old Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd routines, WALL-E's patrolling a now derelict planet Earth, stacking garbage, junk and dutifully doing his best to repair a polluted planet. Enter EVE, an apparently female robot who has been sent to Earth to scan for vegetation. While WALL-E resembles an old VHS system, EVE's a cross between a tampon and an Ipod, all sleek enamel, digital readouts and laser beams. The duo embark on an adventure which teaches us about the fragility and strengths of our ecosystem and condemns mega-corporations/branding/advertising/rampant-consumerism (shades of the sci-fi eco-parable ""Silent Running""), before launching into a second half which takes place upon the Axiom (literally, ""the worthy few""), a spaceship where fat, lazy humans are doted on by machines.The film's best moments occur in its first, Earth-bound quarter. Here our robots share a courtship that evokes Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"", ""Modern Times"", Virginia Cherrill's blind flower girl in ""City Lights"" and the love affair in Keaton's ""The General"". This section is also quite melancholic, WALL-E a lonely outcast thanklessly tasked with cleaning up humanity's mess. We feel for him. He's also a bit like Neville of Matheson's ""I am Legend"" (pet cockroach instead of dog), barricading himself in his bunker each night in an effort to escape sandstorms.Unfortunately the film quickly becomes Pixar's most saccharine, manipulative, contrived, obvious and heavy handed. Cheap death scenes are frequently rolled out to elicit tears (WALL-E keeps dying and his cockroach keeps getting squashed), WALL-E's big sad eyes are relentlessly milked, and the film's ""GARGANTUAN EMOTIONAL MOMENTS"" are mostly all forced and obvious. Throw in a generic ""red button"", ""ticking clock"", ""countdown to explosion"" finale, a series of second-rate action scenes (and obligatory ""poetic flying scenes""), last-minute villains (""2001's"" HAL meets ""Flight of the Navigator's"" Max), weak comedy, corny characters and you have one of Pixar's worst. The film also struggles to cook up interesting visuals and virtual sets, its aesthetics becoming conventional as soon as the film launches into outer space. Stanton's previous Pixar effort (""Finding Nemo"") kept its two sections – expansive ocean reefs and claustrophobic urban fish tanks – much more fresh. With ""WALL-E"" you've seen it all before.""WALL-E's"" message is all over the place, which upon release resulted in it being embraced by both American liberals (hug a tree!) and conservatives (pro free-market, anti big government). Regardless, the film has little real world bearing. Historically, machines increase work, obesity is linked to social class (ie, the poor, not the indolent) and in the real world consumerism/fatties are bolstered not by machines but skinny slave labour abroad. In this way ""WALL-E's"" a very white, middle class, American-centric film: it's an appeal to stop consuming and start recycling rather than a look into the reasons for and futility of both. Bizarrely, the film's ""anti-consumerism"" but fetishizes retro objects - silent films, Zippo lighters, plastic forks, hubcaps, Rubik's cubes, nuts, bolts and bits of treasure - treasure which WALL-E identifies as being representative of humanity. For WALL-E (cool: he's more a historian than garbage-bot), objects have souls, which is capitalist nostalgia axenic.Like most ""environmental films"", ""WALL'E's"" aching for a pure, untouched, unpolluted, pre-globalisation, pre-digital past. A return to the wilderness (see ""Survivors of the Dead""). And like these films (""Avatar"" etc), it wrongly turns ""environmentalism"" into a personal choice. But people are mostly frugal and it is systems, not people, which make society ""happen"". It is not your fault you're inundated with packaging, spam and products with short life-spans. Rather, capitalism as an ordering system hinges on waste, overproduction, expansion, over-accumulation, exponentially increasing consumption, and is designed such that most products go trashed and/or unsold (corporations destroy tonnes of merchandise to prevent sales on the black market and horde goods to manipulate demand/prices etc). It is the ""normal situation"" of bourgeois society for a great part of existing products and of the previously created productive forces, to be wasted. Much of this waste comes from an economic system which pits the same products against one another and requires copious labels and advertising as weaponry in this war. There can be no ""environmentalism"" or ""green movement"" unless one first radically re-figures our whole concept of production, wealth and ""money"" (wrongly, ""WALL-E"" is post money), ""money"" having long been exposed as a powerful political tool for expropriation, as opposed to a mere ""neutral medium of exchange"", as is commonly believed.7.5/10 – Almost as annoying as ""Avatar""."
"What's up with Pixar? Maybe the fact that it takes a LONG time to plan and create an animated feature contributes to the fact that Pixar gets it right EVERY TIME.They have certainly hit the mark with WALL-E. A great movie for kids, a great movie for adults, a not-too-subtle wake up call for us all. A definite winner.My autistic child has been obsessing on being able to see WALL-E for almost a year. That's a lot of build up, and he wasn't disappointed.Take the wife, take the kids, take a date (and be prepared to hold hands!).Loved it."
"As an analogy, this is a TV dinner.You know what you're getting, you know that it will - to a point - satisfy you, yet - just like a TV dinner you'll feel ripped off, hungry for more yet with a sense of regret. You'll come away wishing that you saved up for steak instead.Make no mistake - this isn't a ""Toy Story"" - this isn't a ""Nemo"". The first hour of the movie with little story, few comical moments and NOT A SINGLE LINE OF SPOKEN DIALOGUE, will no doubt leave you questioning the target audience of the movie.Whereas other Pixar/Dreamworks movies will always claim a $15-$20 DVD purchase fee I suspect that Wall-E will sadly eventually become a budget offering in the bargain bin. It has little content for the younger generation and the curdling environmental message leaves little desire to put myself through it's agonizing 90 minutes ever again.What started off as an original offering soon ended up being a ""wannabe classic"" - they tried too hard, or maybe they didn't even try at all.. either way, it just simply doesn't work.Disappointing."
