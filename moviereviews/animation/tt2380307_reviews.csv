Reviews
"Music is banned in Miguel's household after his musical great-grandfather abandoned his great-grandmother and her young daughter. On Mexico's Day Of The Dead festival, a convoluted series of events sees Miguel transported to the Land of the Dead, where he discovers that the dead disappear when no-one remembers them. He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!The story here is very artificially structured, with all sorts of bits and pieces present s that a predetermined trail of events can be created. But you never notice that, so natural is the narrative flow. This film is highly original, full of truly gorgeous visuals, lovely songs, delightful characters, and touching resolutions to several individual story threads. And yet it appeared in the UK with no publicity, trailers, or warnings whatsoever, and my local multiscreen didn't even get it in 3D despite the fact that it is clear that the 3D would be dazzling.This is as good as any Pixar film over the last several years, and better than most."
"Im Mexican and all i can say is Thanks you Pizax,I just saw this movie and i just remembered all my childhood with my grandparents, Mexico was represented beautifully,the music, the colors. This movie touched me in my soul and i cried a lot, i created an account just to say how good pixar made everything, again gracias pixar por tan hermosa pelicula."
"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only reason I was there was to take my daughter to see it is strictly because my wife said there was a short Frozen film that played along with the movie and my daughter just so happens to be the biggest Frozen fan on the face of the planet.Not only was I surprised by Coco, it might be the most in depth best story line I've ever seen in an animated movie. It was also educational and shed an entirely new light on the background of the Mexican holiday Dia De Los Muertos.Wonderful movie, can't say enough good things about it!"
"I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.Though the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.Coco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll."
"Coco is about Dias de las Muerte (Day of the Dead), family, family crises and musical passion. The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.We were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :)It surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. ""there will be no X in this family!"" X being ""instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past"". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?Did I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them ""mama, I miss you.""Beautiful."
As a Mexican born child I cried when I saw this movie and my son who is American born with Mexican parents loves it too.. love to teach him about our roots
"I'm no critic, but Coco is close to movie perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away."
Pixar has come a long way. To them their creations have become a science into human emotion and I don't know any better company that has nearly perfected the craft. Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified. It takes ones thick skull (pun intended) and supplies human emotion as the medium to communicate the message so as to reach the heart. One may call that manipulation but due to its sincere true message and goodness I humbly give it a 10.
We came across with the movie when flipping the channels. No idea what it was and ended up watching one of the best movies ever
"I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town. Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.I got my wish. This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken. This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.Thank you, Pixar."
"Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music. In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos. Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel. Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes. In high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly. It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!"
"I'm a 24 year old student who sometimes tends to overthink about the values of life and how one, including myself, expresses these kinds of thoughts through every form of art that tells a story. So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.Coco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the ""Day of the Dead"" tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family's approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds. 
Quiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn't make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my ""top 10 best movie scenes"" list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me. Actually crying.I could go on and on about Coco, but I'll leave with saying that this is a fantastic movie and I honestly feel grateful that I had the chance to watch it.A must see!!!"
"Coco is a movie with lots of joyfulness and emotion...
I nearly cried when Miguel sang ""Remember Me"" to her great-grandma, that was so impressively touching!!!
And the end of the movie, my heart filled with so much happiness and joy...Everybody should see this Movie..!!!"
"Pixar has done it AGAIN! 'Coco' is a yet another delightful ride from the prolific animation studio, who's winning streak seems to never end. And that's good for all, since 'Coco' is all heart & soul, rewarding the moviegoer wholeheartedly.'Coco' Synopsis: Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.'Coco' captures the themes of Life & Death, with genuine feeling. Themes of family, passion, defeat & redemption also are explored here, but with humor & real emotion. While I laughed for a good share of this winning story, I also found myself weeping in the film's final-act. This is a true fantasy-adventure, that gives life & death true meaning. 
Adrian Molina & Matthew Aldrich's Screenplay is excellent. Lee Unkrich's Direction is colorful. And of course, the Animation is extraordinary. 'Coco' unfolds gorgeously & not for a second, does the pace drop.Vocal-Performances are top-notch! Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, the protagonist, is a joy, Gael García Bernal s Héctor Rivera, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz, the most famous musician in the history of Mexico and Miguel's idol & Ana Ofelia Murguía as Mamá Socorro ""Coco"" Rivera, Miguel's great-grandmother, stand out. And yes, this is a Film made in America about Mexicans & their tradition. Take That, Mr. President!On the whole, 'Coco' deserves all your time & money. Don't Miss It. Oscars, are you ready?"
"Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few ""adult"" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.RATING: 10.0/10.0"
It was great. My favorite part was how the guitar playing was accurate.
"The children movie Coco, was a very heartwarming movie. It showed what the real meaning to family should be. It showed that even though your family might disappoint you there are always there and will be remembered."
"A Pixar's masterpiece, impeccably done in terms of research (about the Mexican culture), animation, script, musicalization, direction and production. A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a quality of animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerful soundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatable characters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in which the story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a ""back to basics"" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about."
"What can i say? I didn't expect much before watching this movie, but it turned out to be a giant masterpiece. Easily the greatest animated movie of all time."
"All my family waiting this movie all the year since we see the teaser and blow up...and more because was a Pixar movie and they all make right all the movies they make (at least the 80%).And Jesus we all not disappointed at all...The music,the animation,the characters,the colors,the family...everything was just perfect.Now being a Mexican born a was worried that Pixar takes so many liberties of the Mexican culture,people,music and more...But that didn't happen they took all the things i mention before and converted in one of the best animated pictures i ever see and make me even more proud to born Mexican.I know you all the see the trailers and teasers and know how the movie it is but NO...the movie have a great twist and surprises that gonna make you love the movie even more...Like i say before everything in the movie is just perfect and one i have to say is that PIXAR portrait The day of the Death (dia de los muertos) very accurate and with a lot of respect.Just see it...you gonna love it Pixar make another classic movie to they collection and Mexican people of all the world...You be pride to be what you are!"
"Absolutely beautiful film. It touched my heart and soul like no other film ever has. Visually gorgeous. The acting was wonderful. That little boy, Miguel, was such a lovely, likable character. I wanted to reach on the screen and hug him. The songs? Wow, just amazing. Where there clichés? Sure, maybe but it didn't matter since the characters were original. The negative and so so reviews.....sorry but you have no heart. I don't think I can trust anyone who doesn't love this film. You are not human."
"Three words... WOW, what an amazing movie, the story starts getting better and better, such a beautiful story, with so much touching moments, amazing soundtrack, congratulations to pixar, total respect to you guys, Mexico is amazing!!! you learn so much about the Mexican culture, incredible."
"I've been trying to get my kids to watch this for a year. They were never interested. Finally, it was my turn to pick. The whole family was in awe. It was colorful, imaginative, and the story was beautiful. That kid who boxes Miguel is amazing. It got me thinking we should start celebrating Dia de los Muertos."
"If you agree with the 'family comes first"" motto, but are tired of it being linked solely to the muscular bald guys and fast cars, then Coco will become a pleasant refreshment for you. A lush and lovingly made animation film based on the Dia de los Muertos theme from the Mexican culture, it is a touching experience and a joy to watch.However, after all the praise Coco received from all around, the actual viewing experience has left me slightly disappointed. Maybe because I did watch The Book of Life, another animation inspired by the Dia de los Muertos lore and featuring the similar ""family wishes vs personal destination"" conflict, a film some consider Coco to be a rip-off of. Or maybe it's because, despite all its pretty visuals, cute characters and singing solid enough, Coco clearly doesn't invest too much into having more than a single layer of meaning.You see, here we have a painted prettily and with lots of fizzy buoyant quirks, but still a rather simplistic take on the eternal topic of love's duality and generations' conflict. A kid who loves music, but hatred for it is a family trait for several generations, so he embarks on an unexpected journey through the world of the dead to find a way to unite again what has once been separated and to mend what was once broken. And to sing a few songs and to battle some personal fears while he's at it. There are some nice and emotional scenes along the way, and some lessons learned for some characters, but it's still more or less a linear journey from A to B where good is mostly good (although not without a typical feminine touch of a raging maelstrom of emotionality), and bad is, well, at least clearly selfish from the get-go, and then it's plain outright evil.What is missing in my opinion is the multi-facet delivery, or at least a deeper morals of the story. Sure, ""love your relatives and do what you believe in"" is cool, but ain't it what every single animated film is eventually about? And you could reach the ending inevitable for such genre with some more convoluted and morally difficult effort than just being a boisterous music prodigy with tons of luck to his aid.It's not a good idea to criticize art for not meeting your expectations. After all, nobody does it just for you, so why what you think must matter at all? Still, if you are not too fond of stories being rather straightforward, then Coco might feel somewhat shallow. And if you're not a kid who loves everything shiny and moving, then the second half of the film might feel kinda random, slapstick'y and, at times, on seriously heavy drugs (the color-changing monkey burping blue flames or multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya to drink an even more giant cactus' tears being some examples). For you, I might recommend watching The Book of Life instead, which, albeit arguably less glossy and vibrant visually, has a story much more complex and not stamping ""good"" and ""evil"" labels on things, thus showing the duality of people and of the life itself.For everyone else, go ahead and watch this film. For its loving care for the Mexican traditions, sharing not just the language but also the passion for something outside the typical Western outlook. And clearly for the multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya - that was hilarious beyond all sane measure!"
"It blows my mind that a majority of people I come across have never seen this movie. I guess people couldn't ""relate"" to the Day of The Dead theme and honoring Mexican heritage. It shows how people are still so self-absorbed about what they want to ""relate"" to, instead of being open to learning about other cultures and traditions that can teach us ALL something. The main theme of this film is FAMILY. So well done, beautifully animated with fantastic songs and incredible moments. The best animated Disney film I have seen in so long. An actual original concept and not a sequel! Enjoyed every second of this film. And cried...a little. Okay, a lot."
"Well Disney and pixar really make such a great movies this year, kinda classic, but you know i love all the character, the color of the picture , and of course the story line , story twist. It was kind of tribute to Mexico culture. I think its a good movie, we learn about Mexican culture of death too in this movie. I think it suits for family, kiddo's will like it very much. well, so far every Disney animation never disappoint me ever, not this time too. Keep a good work Pixar!!PS: i really fascinating with the playful mind blowing color in this movie"
"It's not a secret that every time Disney's Pixar make people of all ages spend their holiday or weekend with their families on the theaters to watch their latest product, the movie must be full of lovable characters, funny scenes, memorable soundtracks, and tear- jerking scenes that would push a critic website like Rotten Tomatoes to score it above 90% or so. Just take a look at Toy Story 3 (99%), Up (98%), Inside Out (98%), and Wall-e (96%). As for this year, we have Coco. As I write this review, Coco already gained a score of 96% on the aforementioned website. Well, it turns out that critics (almost) never wrong when it comes to scoring. Coco helps viewers to remember that no one ever truly dies as long as the memories about them, be it good or bad, live inside the hearts and minds of their loved ones, that the real and true death comes when the records of the dead simply vanished and no one is left to keep them safe and sound inside their neuron system, a cruel fate that everyone on the planet share sooner or later. As terrifying as it is, we are left with the choice of how we are going to be remembered before we fade away into nothingness, is it by doing something remarkable? something evil? something amazing? embarrassing? or just something mediocre? You decide..... Another element that I fall in love with in this movie is the plot twist and what it brings to our protagonist, Miguel, and his family, dead or alive. I mean seriously, no one would ever see that coming, the shocking revelation that will make our mouth open wide and turn the tide of the story.It wouldn't be a Disney movie if at near the end of the movie, they didn't include at least one tear-dropping scene that would almost make everyone sobbing. This time, the heartwarming conversation between our hero, Miguel, and his great-grandmother, Coco (from whom this movie gets it's title). I swear to every divine being that had been, or has been, or being, or will be worshiped by humankind, the guy who sit next to me was rubbing his eyes for a moment (and honestly, I was ready to rub mine had tears leaked from both of my eyes).So far, this movie is really fine by my standard, every generation from every corner of the globe should watch it to remind them that death is not something to be afraid of for it is a part of our life that everyone will undergo someday, that no one ever truly dies, as long as someone still remember them in their memories, forever and ever."
"Once every few years Disney manages to prove me wrong that they are running out of ideas for producing wondeful anime movies based on new concepts / ideas. This movie is trully a masterpiece, unquestionably one of their best ever. I think this film is much better than my favorite of the last few years ""Inside Out"". The quality of the movie is going beyond any expectations as it is brilliantly funny, extremely emotional, and the music is fantastic. Overall, thumbs up for what I personally think is the best anime Disney has delivered in the last 20 years to say the least. 10/10"
"Pixar and Disney, managed to cover in the most masterful way the Mexican custom of the Day of the Dead, a cinematic experience that the world deserves to see to better understand one of the most famous Mexican traditions of this planet. This film is an offering to the Mexican people and a sort of reconciliation between Mexico and the United States."
"I stumbled across this on a streaming service a few days ago, so I popped in here to check out reviews, as Pixar can be hit and miss. WALL-E and up are brilliant, the continuing Toy Story or Cars after the first one not so much. Then I saw all these 10 scores. I thought BS, no film is a 10. Well, except for Citizen Kane.
Coco, a joyous celebration of life and love for life has absolutely changed my mind. Every part of this wonderful film makes the whole film a masterpiece.My first ever 10, and likely my last, cos Coco is unique and will be nearly impossible to top.Genius."
"When i see the trailer, i'm just interested with visual, just that.But this is more and more than that, it's really a masterpiece. This is a movie with very powerful message about love, about family, about dream, about passion, and how we can choose the best in life.I recommend you all to watch this movie."
"There is absolutely everything in this for everyone. Laughs, life lessons, crying. Its all there. This is what happens when Disney get it so right. I cry every single time. The music is amazing throughout. Just perfect."
"Honestly, this movie made me so emotional! I loved it, really felt it with my heart! I'm really happy to see that in the end of 2017 we can still see such quality movies, with great story and feeling in it! Even though I admit, Mexican culture is not so familiar with me, neither I am a fan of this type of music, the movie grabbed me so much!!! Really, it's something I will remember for the rest of my life and will always give me a special feeling once I think of it! Thank you Pixar!!!!"
"The storyline was very unique, so was the concept of the movie. 
To everyone who enjoys watching animations I would recommend this movie. It also has a educational plot, because it shows the importance of family and a bit of the Mexican culture. It was hands down one of the best animations I have watched."
"In the begining I want expecting the movie will be OK, but Pixar done a great great work. Funny moments, tears, laugh all combined in this movie. Plus this is not for kids, adults can find something from this movie. Dont think twice and watch. You can thank yourself later to spend your free time. Go pixar go!"
"Taking place in contemporary Mexico, in a fictional village named Santa Cecilia, ""Coco"" tells the story of a 12 year old musician, Miguel Rivera, whose family - ironically - hates music. There's a pretty good reason why they are against music though. Anyway, nothing can kill Miguel's dreams to meet the success of his icon, Ernesto de la Cruz. It all gets more complicated when he discovers that he is his ancestor and ""steals"" his magic guitar, which sends him to the World of the Dead. Throughout his journey there, he has the company of his adorable dog, Dante, and a trickster skeleton, Hector. That's how much I can reveal about the story.Coco is a flawlessly crafted movie. It's a visual marvel, a musical phenomenon that has three dimensional characters, top-notch voice acting, great sense of humor, a wonderful, deep message and some really emotional moments that will surely make you cry. Coco is about death, life, love, music and hope. It's also the best and most loyal representation of Mexican culture and the Dia des Muertos (Day of the Dead) holiday I've ever seen. At the same time, it's very refreshing, creative and authentic, which will surprise those who think it's a carbon copy of ""Book of Life"". It now has a special place in my heart and it's yet another masterpiece from the studio that reinvented the animation genre."
No words. I'm not one for cartoon movies but this honestly made me cry thinking of my family. Would totally rewatch and recommend ! Be sure to get the tissues out if you're sensitive :')
The story was just so great. The animation was also just the best. I cried at the end.
An Outstanding movie made by Pixar. I never felt so much emotion since after watching Toy Story 3. A lot of creativity was put into this film and I love the Mexican culture brilliantly portrayed in the film.Coco is about family and life. A well written story with a surprising twist at the end which interests the audience to watch what happens next. Spectacular
"Perfection. Good animation, Good colors, Fine songs and Great Messages.
Wonderful. 
Pixar let loose the waterfall of my eyes once again.
So glad, I watched this film."
"What a beautiful movie. Watched it twice and I still liked it very much! The story and the music makes me so happy and I loved that Disney made a movie about the culture of Mexico, especially now with president Trump. What a stunt!"
"Gloriously animated, ""Coco"" takes about twenty minutes to really get going, but when it does, it's an absolute delight for the senses. The animation is strikingly detailed without distracting from the plot, bringing to life a colorful world that's truly unlike anything I've seen in an animated movie before. The musical sequences are alternately gorgeous and touching, full of life and vigor without straying into obnoxiousness, and the movie's characters are well-rounded and engaging. But what makes ""Coco"" all the more impressive is its sprawling, sympathetic narrative, which finds its titular character lost in the afterworld while attempting to find a long-dead relative to benedict his burgeoning love of music. It allows the production team nearly limitless opportunities to create a self-contained world defined by its splendor and its peculiarities, and the finished product is stamped with a deliberate, unique visual and sonic identity. It's a great movie for all ages, but it will surely hold more meaning for those who already have an appreciation for music."
"I have seen a lot of films but only a few of them have touched me as much as coco.
The story building was incredible, you really get to know Michuel and start to feel attached to his story.
De colorfull atmosphere makes it enjoyable to watch and participates in delivering an excellent all-round movie with joy, tears and drama.Pixar delivers yet another masterpiece with (in my opinion) the most powerfull story!"
"Heart touching, mind blowing, forever unforgettable movie. thank you for producing and bringing life to such a cute story."
"How do you feel watching a fantasy movie??
I never tired of watching fantasy movies.
As usual Pixar amazed us with stunning visuals.Story line is very interesting.They have done a very good execution on this 
Hats off to Pixar"
"Have always loved Pixar, and really like to love most of their films (all three 'Cars' films and 'The Good Dinosaur' are my least favourites, and although the second 'Cars' had a lot of problems for me the third one is the only less than average one).As for favourites, they are all three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Up', love 'Wall-E' and 'Finding Nemo' as well. After seeing 'Coco' yesterday, hearing nothing but great things about it and seeing the near-universal critical acclaim, from personal opinion (and many others it seems) it is right up there with the Pixar masterpieces. Would go as far to say it is easily their best since 'Inside Out', which is saying a lot since the films between that and this were lesser Pixar efforts (enjoyed 'Finding Dory' though, though it is a long way from being one of Pixar's best).'Coco' is one of the longest Pixar films, clocking in at nearly two hours, but it sure didn't feel like it. Seeing it in the cinema, the audience was a quite large one, if on a side note not as many as thought. With it being a family film, the weekend and that it was only released three days ago, part of me was thinking it would be sold out. Throughout everybody, children and adults alike, was laughing, in awe and crying. It is also a different Pixar film, with a unique setting and that it is more music/song-oriented, and has replaced 'Inside Out' as their most mature and in depth, with themes that are remarkably daring and relevant.Lets talk about what is so brilliant about 'Coco'. The film is a triumph when it comes to visuals, one of Pixar's best-looking easily. The animation throughout is absolutely spectacular, whether in the real world or the Land of the Dead. The colours are so vibrant and atmospheric and there is so much gorgeous detailing in the backgrounds, nuances in the way the characters look and the skeletal designs and movements have amazing dexterity that is both clever and ghoulish.Just as triumphant is the music. Michael Giacchino's score is one of his best and most multi-layered, capturing the spirit of Mexico in a way that's celebratory. The songs are similarly infectious, ""Remember Me"" is not just a beautiful song but it has a great, upbeat message and adds a lot to the story.The writing has so much spirit, poignancy and entertainment value. The jokes are sophisticated and amusing, neither childish or repetitive to me and Dante is both adorable and funny, and the emotional elements are truly heartfelt, especially in the last act. The story is bright and breezy in pacing, despite the fairly long length one doesn't feel it. The Mexican culture and family values were clearly comprehensively researched and the film feels like a warm, fun and heartfelt tribute and celebration to culture, family, music and even Latino cinema in the Golden Age (the latter proving crucial to the revelation of a major plot twist).Not since 'Inside Out' has a Pixar film made me laugh and bring tears to my eyes as much as 'Coco' did, not since 'Paddington 2' has a film's ending leave me sobbing. The relationship between Hector and Miguel has a huge amount of heart and complexity, one can understand the point of view of the Rivera family (living and dead) and the macabre elements are very imaginatively realised. The twists in particularly the last act keep coming, mostly unexpected and all very clever. Some elements of the reveal with Ernesto were not that surprising (Pixar have done similar and it is fairly clichéd, my one slight criticism with 'Coco' but found it easy to overlook) but none of it was guessable too early and it was extremely well done and tense regardless.All the characters are fully formed and have strengths and flaws. Hector was the most fully rounded and provided the most heart and a lot of us are likely to find ourselves in Miguel and his aspirations. Imelda is also memorable as a character and the chemistry between all the characters is realised beautifully too. Voice acting is first rate, especially the remarkably multi-faceted contribution from Gael García Bernal as Hector. Anthony Gonzalez also voices with spirit and emotion, Alanna Ubach achieves a balance to Imelda of not wanting to get on the wrong side of her and having a caring side and Benjamin Bratt shows a side that one is surprised is in him. In summary, truly amazing and a celebration of a lifetime. One of the most deserving recipients of a perfect score in a while. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Coco (2017) is an animated film co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. It is a story set in the fictitious Mexican town of Santa Cecilia, where young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) embarks on a journey when his passion in life and dreams are called into question by his family. All Miguel wants from this life is emulating the great and famous singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) but his abuela and relatives oppose. Miguel must come to terms with his family and return back home after he disrespects the ""dia de los muertos"" tradition and a curse falls upon him, trapping him with the dead. He finds help from the deceased Hector (Gael Garcia) and members of his family like Mama Imelda (Alana Ubach) as he finds a way to express his talents and learns family history. At its core Coco is a story about passion, memory and family. Miguel follows a story arch where he must learn self value, bravery and the value of being true to one's self while remaining loyal to family, respecting tradition and remembering one's past in the form of family history. With a reputation for great storytelling, juggernauts Disney and Pixar have found a way to tell a story with such a worn arch with a new and authentic style. A lesson is learned by almost every main character as they grow and develop. Passion is pitted against tradition (and perhaps stubborn customs) and the outcome produces strong emotions on the viewer. At times the story felt carried itself with the drama and flair of a Mexican ""Telenovela"". These are some rich themes for what may be considered a ""kid's film"" but they develop organically and are never forced. However the film doesn't lack that slapstick humour or easy and quirky kid's comedy (Especially present in the playfulness of the dead characters' bones). The production team made a respectable effort preparing for the production of this film, and the results were worthwhile and evident. The film is brilliantly set in Mexico, showcasing a wide range of customs and cultural icons that made the film feel authentic. Everything from Mexican cuisine (Like tacos, tamales or ""pan de muerto"") to celebrities (Like Frida Kahlo, El Santo, Pedro Infante or Cantinflas) make an appearance. Traditional ""Mariachi"" or ""Charro"" suits and elaborate woman hairstyles are accurately represented. Mexican family culture is accurately represented from the respect towards our loving, stern and kiss filling abuelas, to that spicy and sassy personality characteristic of Mexican and Latin women. Even the idolization of popular musical icons, similar to Ernesto de la Cruz in the film, resembles the decades old fascination with the likes of actual celebrities like Pedro Infante or Jose Alfredo Jimenez. I authentically felt the story was set in a real, picturesque Mexican pueblo. Every small detail felt in place and that enhanced the story. The film understands and respects the traditions of ""dia de los muertos"" while giving it a modern twist. Despite the difficulties, and risks, that come with portraying such a rich and complex culture the film makes a much appreciated effort in introducing a side of Mexican culture that is at times neglected in favour of easy-to-go stereotypes.The film felt beautifully animated with intricate finger movements while playing a worn-out guitar or the miniscule pores and imperfections of the bones. Visually gorgeous and impressive the film makes use of a brightly coloured pallet, like with the rich orange used for the ""cempazuchitl"" flowers or the ""papel picado"" banners. The music fit perfectly with the tone used for the story and never stopped having a particularly Mexican flavour from the use of the guitar or trumpets to the ""marimba"". The score continued to set the story appropriately. Coco is carried by memorable fun moments, like Miguel's encounter with exotic Frida Kahlo, and beautiful and emotionally filled ones, such as that of the last act which grounded the story's themes of love for music and family during a scene that is sure to invoke a tear or two. Despite a few moments where it felt that the plot was driven by the oversimplified and unexplained mechanics of the curse, the film in general doesn't stop being the memorable and enjoyable experience of a familiar story executed with fresh and authentic style."
"""Coco"" is unquestionably a movie about bridging gaps. In the film, a literal bridge of marigold petals links the Worlds of the Living and the Dead for a night. In the real world, Pixar has tended a symbolic bridge with this film to link Mexicans, Chicanos (U.S.-based Mexicans and their descendants), U.S. nationals and the world via one of our most difficult shared human experiences. This isn't a movie spearheaded by Mexican artists to introduce the world to one of our beloved idiosyncrasies, like the inevitably comparable ""The Book of Life"" (a movie that I like but have far more issues with as a film fan than ""Coco"", regardless of nationality) but to simplify it as ""a culturally appropriative work by a non-Mexican"" would be to not only miss the point of the story told in it but to miss the point in its creation as well.Lee Unkrich and the team at Pixar clearly went at great lengths to not only understand the holiday itself but also how to best present it to those unfamiliar. There's also a clear effort to try and understand the culture(s) that originate, adapt and celebrate the holiday (or as much as one can ""understand"" Mexico in anything less than a lifetime). Why so much effort? What one can infer from interviews with Unkrich is that his decision to make the movie came from a place of genuine admiration and curiosity. Filtered through Pixar's famously thorough work ethic in the service of storytelling, you end up with a film fruit of both love and intelligent, hard work, clear in many of the filmmaking decisions.For those in the know, Mexican Spanish expressions are uttered without subtitles, national celebrities (or at least their skeletal avatars) appear and are paid tribute, the cultural differences between regions of Mexico are alluded to, the movie is clearly set in the modern day and respect for the country, its people and sometimes complicated family dynamics is on display. Regarding our relatives north of the border and elsewhere, the cast of the film is more Chicano than Mexican-born and the more internationally-popular term ""Día de LOS Muertos"" is as common as our preferred ""Día de Muertos"". For those complete outsiders to the holiday, its emotionality and symbolism are explained just the right amount to follow the plot yet leaving some air of mystery while Santa Cecilia is not too far from that most-familiar depiction of small, dusty colonial towns as the face of Mexico. All these compromises show that the film is intended as a message of unity and understanding. Yes, some references will definitely fly over many audiences' heads, but the Pixar magic lies in that, making some parts of the film so specific, they've managed to turn the whole universal.Mexicans, a people defined by a tug-of-war between indigenous, European, personal, global and other identities that work best when balance between them is achieved, are a prime example of the importance of finding what's universal. Our holiday dedicated to ""let's turn mourning into joy"" may seem incongruous but it comes from the observation of joy and death as being equally unifying. We're all united by knowing joy, some of it courtesy of those who've passed on. We're all united by and equal in death, to every being that's ever lived. The death of beloved ones brings us memories, their memories bring us joy, this is the essence of Día de Muertos. ""Coco""'s noble essence, par for the course of the Pixar canon (perhaps not as bold as ""Wall-E"" or ""Monsters University"", but bold enough) is to bridge the relatively small gaps between personal passion and responsibility, Mexas and others, on the same level as those huge gaps between joy and mourning, death and life. Thanks to the respectful research and collaborations behind the film, its essence not only aligns with that of the holiday, but hopefully will complement and strenghten each other, for years to come, for every early November night that we remember... and smile."
"Oh we just came from the movies trying to learn everything about this great animated movie.
