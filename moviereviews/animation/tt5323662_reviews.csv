"Despite revolving around a girl who has impaired hearing, the film has as protagonist Shoya Ishida. He is a bully during his childhood, but when he becomes the victim of bullying himself he grows into a depressive teenager who loathes himself. He starts to understand Nishimiya's solitary world. Both Ishida and Nishimiya end up becoming teenagers who deeply despise themselves for all the burden they cause to their families and how painfully difficult it is to try to make friends.An interesting scene happens when a girl confesses her love to Ishida and he is unable to comprehend what is happening. Some people might say he is too dense to misunderstand what she is clearly doing, but what I see is Ishida hates himself so much he doesn't believe anyone can love him. The concept of a person actually liking him is so alien it doesn't even comes as a possibility in his head.Another interesting scene is when Ishida is leisurely walking and talking with some people and he asks himself if that is really OK. In his head, he has no right of being happy after everything he has done and caused. Despite trying his hardest to redeem himself, he still thinks he is worthless and unforgivable.Don't go into this movie expecting a romance. It is a redemption story."
"A Silent Voice is an emotional and beautiful movie that almost anyone can relate to in some shape or form.The story is both heart wrenching and heartwarming, as it tackles many issues such as bullying, social anxiety, depression, and suicide. Many of the characters deal with some or all of these issues. The issues the characters deal with in the past ultimately lead them into becoming what they are in the present movie. There are many characters in a Silent Voice with some shining more than others. Shoya is a great main protagonist who (unlike most movies) is battling something much bigger in his life, his past self. The other main character Shoko is outstanding. You can really genuinely feel all her emotions just through her facial animations alone. Other notable characters I enjoyed were Shoya's best friend Tomohiro (who brought a nice comedic presence to the film) and Shoko's little sister Yuzuru. My only problem with a Silent Voice is with a couple of side characters who show up once and a while, but don't really contribute as much to the film - this is only a small nitpick though.The majority of the music in a Silent Voice is played only by piano making the film take a more somber tone. This makes a lot of scenes feel more peaceful and calm contradicting what many of the characters feel deep down inside. 
The song titled ""Lit"" is a beautiful piano piece that I believe would make anyone emotional, when listening to it. So I enjoyed a lot of music in a Silent Voice with a couple of songs that really stood out.The animation in this movie is absolutely gorgeous. There's a firework scene that is beautiful, it definitely is the animation highlight in this film...it's breathtaking.In conclusion, I absolutely love this film. Everything feels so genuine and the characters feel so real. It really feels like there was a lot of love and care put into this movie and it definitely shows. This movie made me cry and I can almost assure you that it will do the same to you.

"Have always been a big fan of anime, particularly Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki without restricting myself to just them (some of my favourites are actually without either involved).Any film dealing with bullying and its consequences deserves to be applauded for the effort. Bullying, often stemming from something that should be a non-issue but turns out to be an easy target for bullies (for examples if your parents disallow you to play a popular video game for obvious reasons, if you have a posh accent, if you listen to and perform classical music, if you have a physical or social disability, false rumours spread about you, if you were a hard-worker rather than somebody who messed about and disrespected substitute teachers) is something that is very much relevant still and has damaging effects, it is an issue that needs to be addressed and acted upon much more than it is. This is coming from somebody who suffered merciless bullying myself in school, for all the above reasons apart from the first (in my case my school did nothing about it too), and nearly a decade on it has damaged my confidence/self-esteem, made me feel worthless and made my already bad anxiety worse despite getting a degree in music and singing regularly.So as one can probably tell, 'A Silent Voice' really resonated with me on an emotional level. At the same time, it also really made me think and see that there is much more to the issue, the bully, the witnesses and the victim than one would tend to perceive. 'A Silent Voice' also turned out to be a very good film in its own right. It isn't flawless, some of the supporting characters are under-explored and in a few cases inconsistently and one-dimensionally written and some of the story jumps around and doesn't always feel complete.Despite being over two hours, didn't think it was too long considering the number of characters and their stories. If anything, perhaps 'A Silent Voice' would have been even better as a series which would have solved the problems.On the other hand, 'A Silent Voice' has an awful amount to recommend. Great isn't a strong enough word to describe the animation. Rich in meticulous background and character detail, atmospheric and ethereal in colour schemes and alive to nuances in its use of settings and character gestures and expressions, it becomes a character of its own and there are some memorable images throughout like towards the end. The music has whimsy, haunting beauty and understatement, while not overbearing the drama and letting it speak when needed. The song is catchy.The writing is thought-provoking and contemplative, doing it in a way that will make bullying victims and those who bullied alike identify with what is said. A lot of it is remarkably insightful, and even when the film was really resonating with me it taught me a lot about an issue that isn't as black and white as perceived. The story has its issues but has a strong emotional core, with the truly powerful and touching ending leaving me shell-shocked.Not often does one find themselves rooting for a bully as well as the victim, 'A Silent Voice' is one of those rarities. The voice acting is dynamic.In summary, not perfect but very well done. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"To begin with, a friend of mine recommended me this movie. At first, I was skeptical about it because personally, I'm not a big fan of Anime type of movies but I decided to give it a go.The movie is beautiful to look at. The movie is hand-drawn, and the outdoor settings and backdrops are breathtaking.A Silent Voice is a film that had me hating throughout the first act, realizing I was wrong throughout the second act, and on the verge of tears throughout the third act, due to how well this movie does a complete 180. The story is powerful enough to have many in tears in the final sequences. Therefore, for me, ""A Silent Voice"" is a true piece of art.This movie is definitely worth the time and the awards."
This is one of the best animated movies I ever watched.
"The visual storytelling is powerful and effective soundtrack, you don't even need to read the subtitles to know what the characters are saying. But I felt sad for that girl. There is a huge shock in this movie. How people change. How much a person can be loved. As a teenager I have much more things to learn. Probably If I'll have time I will watch it twice. Even I fall in love with ANIME after watched this."
"A Silent Voice or Shape of Voice is a beautiful drama film about a guy who struggles to redeem his past that tackles heavy themes such as bullying.Apparently, there are a lot of characters in this 2-hour long film. And quite a number of them I believe didn't develop to the maximum as the film concludes but it was suffice enough to convey the message that the film desires to.However, huge compliments should be given to this film for the amazing build up before reaching its climax which is realistically intense, powerful and heartfelt that will leave you on the edge of your seat with your jaws dropped. You might as well cry, too.The only technical thing that I didn't like in this film is that some scenes have unusual tones that don't match well with their focuses (most probably because of cultural differences). It was really odd for me.In a nutshell, I love this film for tackling heavy themes and also for its healthy dose of drama. I believe it might be better if it's made into a series. XDThank you for your time!"
"Another, fantastic, Brilliant work of art by Kyoto Animation alongside Trigger studio, MadHouse and of course Studio Ghibli and many more theses are the studios that lead the anime world, In my opinion. Koe no katachi or A silent voice is honestly one of my favorite anime alongside Spirited Away from the animation alone is brilliant, when I first saw the trailer I feel in love and knew it was going to be up there as one of my favorite but actually seeing, the story is well done, follows the Manga well, the Manga characters are explored a lot more in depth then the movie but the movie is like 2 hours 10 minutes long it would be difficult to add 7 volumes worth of content into that time frame but Kyoto Animations did the manga justice, I would recommend the Manga author/artist Oima Yoshitoki its a brilliant Manga I would beyond recommend the anime its doesn't matter what one you read/watch first the movie covers the main bulk of the manga. In my opinion one of the best movies, it has sensitive subject matters but deals with them with respect and such a beautiful message when you watch the films I would also recommend looking more into reviews and other views on it and theory's they really make you...Smile :)Story. 10/10 As I said before sensitive subjects, well executed though.Animation. 10/10 Its Kyoto Animations...I will leave it at that. Music. 10/10 Yeah brilliant the opening was unexpected but not unwelcome, the tone change that happens after the opening was brilliant and the music throughout was fantastic. Characters. 10/10 (As I said manga goes in more depth but the movie goes into the characters quite well you feel like you understand motives etc.) Also I bow to the voice actress of Nishimiya Shōko (Saori Hayami)just beautiful. Enjoyment. 10/10 I'll be honest I cried, like four times but that is just me I get emotional with my anime but still didn't stop me loving this anime in fact I love it even more. listen I just cant get enough of this anime just. WELL DONE!"
"When it comes to anime, I don't find myself watching nearly enough in order to form a list of favourites, but even if I had watched everything under the moon, I still believe A Silent Voice would make the list. This is a spectacular film from start to finish. Keep in mind, this can be a very tough film to sit through for multiple reasons, and that is exactly what I'm going to dive into throughout this review, because I feel that a few precautions should be taken when going in. Here is why A Silent Voice deserves to be seen by everyone, even though it won't please everyone.At its core, this film is about a new student that comes into a school, who just so happens to be hearing impaired. Ishida, the school bully, taunts her to the point of tears, for audiences as well. Without ruining the impact of certain scenes, I'll just say that his actions were quite Risqué. I found myself absolutely hating his character, which was very frustrating, due to the fact that the film asks you to sympathize with him on multiple occasions. After growing up and leaving his harsh ways in the past, these two characters reconnect, forming a highly unlikely bond. A Silent Voice asks for your acceptance almost too often, but trust me, if you're in the forgiving mood, this film turns out to be extremely powerful. So that's the warning I must give you, that if you're not ready to be forgiving of a terrible actions, I'd wait until you're in the right mood to watch this movie.Throughout Ishida's transformation from a bully to a kind-hearted human being, it wasn't just the dialogue that impacted me, but the visuals surrounding him. Every time he would pass by other people that knew him, they had X's on their face. When this aspect comes into play a little later in the movie, I'd be lying if I said it didn't move me. From beginning to hate the film for displaying a very unlikable character, this story really does a great job at winning you over, especially through it's silent, visual storytelling in the background, foreground, and even anytime that it makes it blatantly obvious.When a movie makes you wait for it to be really good, it can be a pretty frustrating experience, but I see something different when reflecting on this film. It's all about redemption and how forgiveness is everything when you truly want to become a better person that what you were in the past. Evil is all throughout everyone, but you're not supposed to act on it. This is one of the message that I feel the movie tries to convey and I believe it's a wonderful lesson to everyone. The themes presented throughout this film are taken very seriously, so I don't think it will appeal to a younger audience, but I think older teenagers will be the perfect demographic here, for the lesson it's giving.In the end, A Silent Voice is a film that had me hating throughout the first act, realizing I was wrong throughout the second act, and on the verge of tears throughout the third act, due to how well this movie does a complete 180. With a powerful story, a final sequences that will have many in tears, and an overall film that is worthy of awards, I can't recommend this enough. That being said, I can't get myself to give this movie a perfect score, due to the fact that I think it took a little too long to win me over. I found myself disliking the movie throughout the majority of it, until my eventual realization, which is my one warning, so I feel I won't be alone on that. A Silent Voice is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year."
"One of my favorite movies of all time is koe no Katachi which is a Japanese animated film. I love this essay because the animation is vibrant and beautiful , the characters are fun and loveable, and the plot is quite different. The movie is about a group of grade schoolers who recently had a new student join their class but there is one problem, she is deaf. The class at first doesn't really interact with her much because of her disability and some downright don't like her. The main character in the movie named shouko is just a kid who hasn't yet been taught manners. Everyone in the class thinks he is hilarious, he is the one who harasses shoya the most by doing all sorts of terrible stuff to her. But one day he takes her hearing aid and ends up hurting her. Even though she endures all of this, she try's to be friends with everyone. Everything then comes to a stop when the principle comes to discus that shouko is being builled, and shoya is the one everyone blames even though he wasn't the only one. Shouko ends up transferring away, and the class turns against shoya. He ends up being the most hilarious to most hated, it's like night and day for Shoya. Everyone treats him like how he treated shouko telling him to get lost. He then goes on with his schooling with no friends which totally changes him, he becomes quite, introverted, and unsociable.This movie is great because it is such an emotional movie that shows you that you should treat everyone you meet with kindness. It really humbles your ego by showing how this boy was trying to be funny but in the end no one liked him. You go from hating him to almost feeling bad for him. Even though he did all this cruel stuff to her I felt bad because everyone makes mistakes in there lives. Some mistakes are being then others which means the punishment is greater. Shoya ends up going to sign language school to try and make amends with Shouko and himself. I really liked the fact that he realizes that he messed up bad and try's repent for his sins. This movie really makes you think before you say anything in life becasue the decisions you make can drasticly affect your life for the better or good. The animation of the movie koe no Katachi is so spectacular. The colors of this movie are very vibrant and warm even though most of the story is quite sad. This movie because of its animation has won best screen play in Japan. Many of the characters in the movie are easy to get attached to and well put together. Each character is very unique and has its own place in the story. Without these characters the movie would have been quite bland. The story is quite different then most storylines but I am glad it was like this because it truly puts you in a roller coaster of emotion. The movie tackles the topic of mental health, well being and as well as redemption. I feel this is a topic lots of people can relate with. This movie shows us how devastating depression and anxiety is to someone, and how even though this people have depression or unhealthy mental they are still trying to find redemption for there actions."
2017 is a good years for anime lovers around the world because after Kimi no na wa one of my favorite anime movie of all time we have a chance to witness Koe no katachi a anime that not only is the best example why we love anime but also can connects with each of us in a very personal level.Seriously i can't tell how many time my mouth open wide with pure shock and exited when some of the scene in the movie can relate so much to me and my life from just a little boy to a full adult today.The characters is very likable and very realistic from my view point when they deal with a lot of hardship in life that when from just a small decision to something that can literally change your personality and make your regret for the rest of your life.The anime also balance the comedy and drama very well so when a important scene happen you can easy follow and feel the same emotion of the characters.I bet after this anime anyone can learn a valuable lesson about life and can change to be a better version of yourself.Now had to read to manga right the way so you guys after read my review better buy a ticket and see this movie ASAP
"A Silent Voice is an anime drama film directed by Naoko Yamada (K-On!). Based on the manga of the same name by Yoshitoki Oima, it is a touching and affecting story of one's struggle for redemption.While he was in elementary school, Shoya Ishida, in an effort to fit in with his fellow peers, teased and bullied a deaf girl in class named Shoko Nishimiya. However, this backfires on Shoya and he ends up being shunned by the other students as Shoko ultimately ends up transferring elsewhere. Now in high school, Shoya has felt constant remorse for his actions and attempts make things right with both Shoko and the classmates who ostracised him.Poignant and beautifully animated, A Silent Voice is not only a well made anime film, but also an interesting commentary on the state of one's mental health and well-being. This film will likely strike a chord with anybody suffering from depression and/or anxiety who wish they could find a way to fix their past mistakes. Also, despite its serious tone, director Naoko Yamada still manages to insert some humorous and quirky comic relief at appropriate times, much in the vein of what was seen in K-On!, her previous work. The Japanese voice acting is solid, however it is Saori Hayami as the voice of Shoko Nishimiya who stands out the most. Her performance as a deaf girl was highly convincing and never seemed exaggerated or too comical. I have not yet seen the English dub but I plan to do so in the not-to-distant future.I rate it 8.5/10"
"I rate A Silent Voice a solid 9.5/10. I'd recommend to for it's beautiful animations done by Kyoto Animation and the beautifully written story by Reiko Yoshida. The poster art may come off as a romantic anime movie, but I think it would be more accurate to describe it as a modern tale of heartfelt moments and tragedy. The main character of the story Shoya is shown as a playful boy, but after Shoko, a deaf girl, transfers into his elementary school. He finds her disability disgusting and starts to bully her. The bullying eventually gets to the point where she has the adults involved and eventually transfers away. However, during the time in between these two events and after Shoya gets bullied. He recieves his karma for his actions more and more before he realizes he might not have any friends. I would recommend this movie to others if you want a sad, but heartfelt movie. I would rate this movie a 9.5/10 and not a 10/10 for one reason. I was disappointed that the part where Shoya visits his elementary school and confronts the teacher about his past, from the original manga, was left out of the film. 
To refute a certain critique, who says many things have been left void, I say do you not see the story line. Although the beginning skips a bit in time, the rest of the film goes in chronological order. If you are asking what were the other characters doing during their time away from Shoya and Shoko they were doing their own things. This is shown when everyone is shown watching fireworks, revealing to your surprise they have a life out side of the story. This certain critI rate A Silent Voice a solid 9.5/10.

This certain critique continues on that the character developments were dull. What was dull about the characters? They each had their own personalities and ways of thinking. Yuzuru was a caring sister who wanted to help her sister after hearing of her sister's troubles. Ueno was bit of jerk, but showed she really did care about Shoya by trying to help him make up with his old friends to go back to his good old days. Their are many other characters that were flushed out, but I do see how a character such as Toshi Mashibasa was not really flushed out as a character, since his segment with Shoya from the original works were not adapted, but overall there was definitely character development that you either missed or ignored.
This certain reviewer continues tries to point out Shoko's confession to Shoya that she had feelings for him was a stupid moment for Shoya. Have you actually understood that it was hard for him to understand her. I could see how the translation seems weird since it was a misunderstanding done with Japanese word play, but it is quite simple to understand that she spoke in way that it was hard for him to understand. You also say if he accepted her confession it would have prevented Shoko's attempt at suicide, but do you really think it was because of her failure to convey her feelings at that time, rather than the argument that essentially revolved her and Shoya split the group of friends? The reviewer continues on that they were disappointed that Shoya and Shoko did not become a pair. I personally don't see the proper argument for this at all. I do see how the poster art is misleading, but I thought it was shown this was not a love story when he could not understand her confession. The movie gives it that one scene and is it. They are just close friends. This reviewer continues on that he promised god that he would face his disasters and this was frustrating to them since he broke the promise. He did eventually come to terms with everyone when all of the X's on their faces fell off. The movie shows he has extreme trust issues with the literal X's illustrating how he views people his age. This reasoning was even shown during his montage to a high schooler, when he was bullied by his closest childhood friends. He was isolated, beaten, and was talked badly about to others ruining his own reputation. His closest friends were something he couldn't think of as friends and caused him to be traumatized. Your argument of the promise is no stronger than a New Years resolution, but instead of losing weight it was a promise to overcome his past trauma ique continues on that the character developments were dull.

"I love this movie so much. It's one of the best animated movies I've ever seen period, I cried much more than I'd like to admit. And now it's even more sad after the tragic fire that claimed 33 lives last night at Kyoto Animation. I am still at a loss for words over it. My condolences and best wishes to the whole company and I am praying for a speedy recovery. Stay Strong KyoAni, we all love you. <3"
"Everyone deserves a shot at redemption at least once, especially if they are already repenting the wrongs they have done to others in the past. A Silent Voice ruminates on the issues of bullying, how it not only affects the ones directly involved but those around as well, and how the path to forgiveness is more complex than it seems.The story of A Silent Voice (also called The Shape of Voice) concerns a high school boy who deeply regrets his elementary school days during which he bullied a deaf classmate to the point where she moves away. Shunned by his friends and living a life of a social outcast since, he tries to make amends by finding her & apologising.Directed by Naoko Yamada, the film is narrated in non-chronological order which at times is difficult to follow since the segments aren't properly arranged. The themes of isolation, bullying, loneliness, companionship, peer pressure, regret & redemption are addressed well but the story still needed a more compact structure to deliver the desired impact.There are times when it becomes a bit repetitive, it definitely runs a tad too long and it struggles to juggle with so many characters at once to the point that we have hard time differentiating some of them or what role they played in the event that its plot is weaved around. The animation is wonderful, voice acting is serviceable, and it's got some emotionally powerful moments in store too.But this would have been a far more involving & emotionally rewarding experience if it had kept its focus on Shoya & Shoko for the most part. The supporting characters are given far more attention than required, making this film overlong, plus they don't even play that big a role in the final outcome either. All in all, A Silent Voice is going to impress many folks but had it trimmed the fat and streamlined the narrative, that number would've gotten some serious boost. Worth a shot anyway."
"I cant say too much, but the movie is very nice and make me so sad. It's better than Kimi No Nawa/Your Name in my opinion. Suicide, social anxiety, bullying, disabilities, depression, none of these are played as anything overly dark, dramatic, or tragic. It's just portrayed as real. Which they are."
Just one word fantasic.i cry everytime i think about nishimiya :(
"Makoto Shinkai shadowed this movie so hard it seems that Koe no Katachi lost its capacity to shine; he did a good job and all, but this is just one step above on every aspect. Doing an adaptation of another amazing work, inserting several manga inside a single movie of that quality is really hard, and only a few people did that throught history. Naoko Yamada is still the messiah anime needs but not the one weebs want. She's Jesus and Batman combined, and Liz and the Blue Bird will probably suffer of the same thing."
"I tell ya, this was one of the hardest anime film I have ever watched. I was literally so angry at Shôya and Ueno for throwing away Shoko's eight hearing aids (nearly nine when Ueno did try again to throw away Shokos hearing aids). They really were such bullies that if either of them were my children, I would definitely give them great punishment that would wake them up for the rest of their lives. I actually was really glad that Shoyas mother took money out of his bank account and paid Shokos mother. You would definitely feel sorry for Shoko, she was so badly picked on because of who she was as a deaf person. I don't know anyone personally who is deaf but unfortunately, I am sure bullying regarding deaf people exists and its just not fair for them because they didn't ask for it. It really is sad the world we live in. I was even glad this wasn't a romance this time, normally I would say the main characters should be together but in this film, it would be better off to not have Shoko and Shoya to be together romantically. I mean, I really wish Shoya didn't have to meet him again for the way he treated her, although I feel sorry for him that he is thinking of suicide, so is Shoko. It is definitely not a nice feeling when you bullied someone, you are full of guilt and you meet them again with regret hanging over you. That's why I think it would be better to not have the pair of them meet together again. Its a really good film too despite its very sad concept. It really does wake you up to wanting to help someone who is bullied and is in need of support from a friend. Bullying always needs to stop, please help someone who is in need of help folks <3"
"This is the first anime I am reviewing. The story is really powerful. It is a story about relationships, growing up and redemption. Ishida who bullied a deaf and mute girl in school becomes the victim of alienation and ignorance in his subsequent years. He doesn't remember friendship and is on the verge of killing himself. Seeing the girl that he bullied in his formative years again changes everything.This anime has a strong character development, we see a loner learning to live again and even make some friends. Don't get fooled by the cutesy looks, the anime has deep and dark undertones which are very prevalent in today's society. Overall a great anime which shows it is never too late to forgive yourself."
"Following the success of ""Your name"" we now have the next successful anime that is currently sweeping the charts of Japanese and Asian box offices. ""A silent voice"" captures various mature and serious topics, packed into a wonderfully animated 2 hour feature. It deals with topics such as: social anxiety, fitting in, bullying, suicide, all such that wouldn't be expected in a teenage romance/drama anime that we were led to believe. No, a silence voice tries to capture a much broader idea with a reasonable amount success. Though the film has been heavily marketed to feature the female protagonist, a deaf girl she really isn't the centerpiece of this film, this film really takes a much more in depth look at our male protagonist, a bully. This is quite a refreshing view from the lens of someone on the other side of most modern day films and takes an unconventional look from a very interesting angle, while sidelining the romance as a brief sub-plot. This film at its core is about trying to fit in and the notion of being isolated but it was also highlighted that it was very important for one to get over their own guilt and to quite literally put in this film ""face the world again"".This film does best at capturing this atmosphere, the sense of mistrust and uncertainty towards others, the use of literal crosses on the characters that our protagonist encounters to represent his own lack of self confidence and fear of social interactions was a very good stylistic choice in my opinion. This film is however flawed mostly in the development of character, many of the secondary characters and even in some cases the main characters are quite poorly developed, many secondary characters come out of nowhere and their motives are very much unknown to the audiences and sometimes plain irrational, I understand that it was a very important thing that within this group of friends each character represents their own flaws however because of this lack of development these characters grow to be rather irritating and distracting, detracting from the overall narrative at various times. These character flaws can be understood due to the fact that this is an adaptation of a manga series and it should noted that it attempts to cram in way too much information resulting in such complications."
"I know a lot of you would disagree with me but this movie is by far better then Your Name. Look I know Your Name is 2017's best anime movie but I have to disagree. Personally I think this movie shows teaches you how to deal with bullies, not to go into depression of killing your self and how you can seek redemption of your past mistakes. This movie even explains to you doesn't matter if you are deaf or blind there is always help and places you can fit into. Long story short you must watch this movie."
"Jesus Christ, this movie is so sad, yet also strangely heartwarming. I was in tears throughout most of the movie. I found myself rooting for Shoko and eventually Shoya as well. I think this movie should be a requirement for children in school, as it shows the consequences of bullying and that there is redemption even for a bully.Obviously, the writing in this is great, as well as the animation.My only qualm with this movie was some confusion over the flashbacks. The way some scenes were cut together made it hard to decipher exactly what was happening or what had happened. This is a Japanese film so maybe this confusion has something to do with it being translated for English audiences? Either way, this confusion didn't hinder the movie too much and it was still very enjoyable to watch.I would recommend this movie a hundred times over!"
"It taught me about how people that bullied me only did that because I never spoke up and that infuriated them even more. They thought that I thought that I was the only victim in those situations. I wasn't the only one that was bullied in my class. There was a guy that had hearing problems which most of the kids in my class treated the same way the characters did Nishimiya at the beginning of the movie (they were kind to him and helped him out whenever they could) but a few days pass and that routine becomes annoying to everyone because he ""doesn't contribute"" to anything and he gets all the special treatment so everyone started to turn on him besides me and a couple of other people. What I would like to say next is that I was like grown up Mashiba in the movie and made them stop doing that, but no, I was like the most despicable character in the movie, Kawai. I thought of myself as someone that was good just because I thought what they were doing was bad. I also thought it was brave of me to say they should quit doing that, but as soon as I sensed they might turn on me even more, I just stopped saying that to them. Now that I've watched this movie I am disgusted by my younger self and that I ever thought I was a good person for just thinking what the others were doing to him was bad instead of taking action. I now know, because of this movie, why almost nobody liked me when I was younger. I am a changed man now, bsacuse of this movie.
Thank you for reading my review of the most important movie of my life."
A Silent Voice Is more than just a really good high school romantic drama. It is a captivating love story that deals with depression and friendship in a remarkably relatable way. Without spoiling too much. I just really appreciate the believably of most of the film. Unlike Your Name where I found some parts to be overly cheesy or slow paced. A Silent Voice offers up nice character development and introduces a whole array of interesting side characters to the plot. I do really like the idea of having a deaf friend. I've often thought about what that would be like and the whole learning sign language and writing on a book to communicate. It offers a-not often seen- perspective of that life. I found it quite invigorating and motivating to step up my own life.
"And I think I found a great film to start on. I liked pretty much everything about it. The two main characters were both very well developed and were placed inside of a great narrative. This movie gets very sad at some points. It's very emotional effective although I didn't cry. (Keep in mind no movie has actually made me cry as of yet). I genuinely didn't know where the story was going. It's not like there were a bunch of twists or turns, I'm just saying it wasn't necessarily predictable. Also another thing that impressed me was how defined the side characters were as well. I liked all of them and they all had unique traits, except there was this one guy who just came out of nowhere and wasn't interesting in the slightest. Forget his name, but he had red hair. The one problem I did have with it wasn't really the movies fault it's just that the version I was watching didn't have subtitles for the sign language. So that was annoying but over the film still works incredibly well. Oh I also forgot to mention that the animation is beautiful. This movie is just on the verge of being a 10. It's 94% though."
"Started with manga book #1 but after the first few pages got the impression it was going to be too much of just another young adult school love drama. So decided to go ahead with the movie: if I liked it, then I would read the series.
Boy, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.
To start with the only negative comment I have: this is by far and beyond the movie which includes the most apologies I have ever seen in any movie. Some times it's not really clear whether the characters have any reason to apologize, they just feel terrible about something that happened, they can't or couldn't have changed it, they clearly wish it had not happened, or some times they even are the victims... In any case, they apologize, and apologize, and apologize... Almost all of them apologize at some point or another throughout the movie. And these are not casual apologies, some are very formal and intense, Japanese style, long and expressive ones.
And done with the negatives. I'm giving this movie 9/10 because even though the apologizing can feel suffocating at times, it's there because of rather serious circumstances which do pile up and call upon so many sorrys. Quite a nasty class of bullying is on the table. Also plain old meanness, unfairness, miscommunication, depression, isolation, low self esteem, fear, anxiety, love, loss, etc. etc. I found this light-looking young adult movie deeply heart wrenching and poignant. I'm not exactly a cry-baby, and second half of this movie I was pretty much in tears most of the time. From childhood till adulthood I grew up with a neighbor who was deaf-mute, that might be part of it. Also not sure if they used an actual deaf-mute actress for the German version but to me it sounded completely realistic and plausible the way a deaf-mute sounds like. Every time that character apologizes for anything, just to hear the way she pronounces ""Tut mir leid"" (sorry) is quite the heartbreaking experience for me, even if German is not my native language whatsoever.
This movie was also imho quite original, visually speaking. Simply beautiful.
After going through the unexpected emotional rollercoaster of watching it for the first time, only then I read about it and found out that both the movie and manga series have received several awards.
In conclusion, and needless to say, very very highly recommended."
"I came upon many films in this time, like Your name, Wolf Children, 5 Centimeters per Second, Garden of Words. And really they are all beautiful in their own ways. But today I came upon this film ""Koe No Katachi""(Aka A Silent Voice) and after watching this, I felt for an eternity that this is best film, I have ever seen in my life. Really this catalyst creation is a masterpiece in its terms and condition. It chooses a 60's song as OP which clearly brought out the jerk characteristics of the hero when he was a child and a solitary ending with soothing sound of reality which prevails the polished soul of the hero when he was successful in his way to redemption. The most important is that the story is not only focus in a point, but it is rather made a great impact through out our society and gave many celestial message about the bad effects of bulling, social anxiety e.t.c.At last I have to say it is a much worthy film that mankind should give it a run in their lifetime. This is a motivation being itself.Though I listened this news that it is not as attractive as the manga but i have to say, this film is enough to beat all categories. You have to agree that it is quite impossible to pen a 7 volume manga into a 2 hours film. So don't provide negativity, just fell it and be positive, It is only for your benefit. All the above is just my personal opinion, so don't carried away by it. And thanks for paying visit to this receive, I bet it touches you."
"I watched this movie only yesterday, and I was really entertained by the whole movie. But it wasn't until today that I realized just how much I loved it. Various scenes went around in my head and the messages of the movie were made clear in my mind.Is this the greatest movie ever made? No. Is it one of my personal favorite movies of all time? Without a doubt, the answer is yes.From a story point of view, Koe no Katachi is a very unique movie. To my knowledge, there has never been an animated movie based around a Deaf character in any shape or form, and if there were, the deafness is usually used as a comedic tool. This movie takes the concept of a deaf girl and uses it as an aid for emotion. This is a redemption story, about a man who tries to redeem himself not for anyone else in particular, but instead for himself and the girl, as he realizes that what he did all those years ago was wrong and he needs to put them rightAs this is an Anime movie, Art is very important to get right. This movie has an believably beautiful, yet simplistic art style. For me, it fits somewhere between the shade and detail heavy (yet somewhow still simplistic) Kimi No Na Wa and the simple shade light style of Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo. It's very pleasing to the eyes and heavily relies on a lot of light shades of colour, which contrasts very nicely with any shading it might useSoundwise, the movie uses a lot of pleasing piano melodies that accentuate the raw emotional parts of certain scenes and really draws you in. The use of the Who's 'My Generation' at the start isn't something that I expected in this kind of film (usually it's a J-Rock or J-Pop song), but it fits with the part it's used in. The neding some also has beautiful lyrics that sum up the messages in the movieThe characters in this film all have defining traits that make them stand out. The main character's redemption completely changes his character, to the point where he changes for the better, while still containing elements of his personality of his younger self. The deaf girl is a beautiful character who only wants people to understand what she's been through and to always show a smile and always look on the bright side. She is without a doubt my favorite character in the movie, as her determination to put things right even if they aren't her fault really spoke to me and I really wanted her to be happy. Plus I thought she was just really adorable and by the end I just really wanted to reach out and give her a big hug and let her know everything is OK. i won't talk about the other characters as it would spoil key points, but they are all vital to the development of the 2 main characters and all have defining traits.This was one of the most enjoyable movies that I had ever seen. The amount of thought that went into writing every word was evident. Every second of this movie was top quality and I couldn't pick a single flaw at any point in the film. There were just so many messages in the film, but I think that main one was basically; No matter what you've done in your past, if you've ever bullied anyone or picked on anyone, if you've done harm to others, it is never too late to redeem yourselves. Even if it's just for yourself so you aren't haunted by your past, or if you want to put things right with someone who deserves all the best or didn't deserve hate in the past. The important thing to remember is if you really try, you can create good deeds from bad memories. Getting into Anime really has been on of the best things I've ever done. The quality of the stories, the emotional values and the effect it has you is like nothing I've ever witnessed before."
"Without adding exaggerated dramatic scenes, this movie has the elements for being a perfect drama.
Discrimination, love, life, depression, friendship, betrayal, death, loneliness and all of the human feelings are there in a group of teenagers, and mainly two of them, who struggle to understand each other beyond what makes them different, both mentally and physically.
The movie has a deep and touching message.
Despite the animation not being amazingly colourful or full of shadings, the music and the visual sequences allow for the spectator to connect with the characters. Because of this, I highly recommend paying attention to every detail and analogy.
Without spoiling much, I'd like to point out that its characters are incredibly realistic. It's not the typical movie with a Deux ex Machina or a life-changing event which makes all of the characters suddenly realise their mistakes or become more mature from one scene to the other, so that at the end everyone is happy. It is actually closer to what real life is.
This movie is definitely a must watch , not only for anime fans, but for everyone."
"An Engaging plot, fleshed out characters, beautiful animation and a dose of complex emotions combine to make one of the best Japanese animated films I've seen. Every time I watch it, I keep on wanting to watch it again, a day later."
I love it so much!!It made me cry 3 or 4 times.It made me cry because one of the characters was gonna commit suicide and the other person was trying to save her and then the person saving the other person but...BUT then the person trying to save the other person ended up falling but luckily the person ended up landing in the water...THANK GOODNESS!!!
"Watched for MyAnimeList's Anime Watching Challenge 2019 - Watch an award-winning animeAs someone who grew up partially deaf, Koe no Katachi is a manga series that has held my heart ever since I first discovered it. Shoko has always been a character I've been able to somewhat relate to and look up to in a way. When the anime movie was first announced, I wasn't so keen on the idea. I didn't think they'd be able to fully create the same effect that the manga has, the same beautiful scenes and facial expressions that really capture the full heart of this story.I'm so glad I decided to watch it and at least try it out and see how it was.What Naoko Yamada did with the Koe no Katachi franchise is nothing short of amazing. You can feel just how much love went into this film, how much care was put into the frames. I don't think I caught any mistakes or goofs or any sight of any lazy drawing or animations.This is an utterly touching story on depression, writing your wrongs, friendship and a strong message that no matter what, you aren't alone. With tense scenes, beautiful heart-felt scenes that make you tear up and sniff, this is the utmost best that could have been created for the Koe no Katachi franchise. This film brings together all the handcrafted details that make this story as special as it is. Every second is crafted from nothing but pure love and attention to detail to create such an accurate and detailed story that leaves the viewer out of breath, in tears and with a fully warmed heart. As someone with impaired hearing, I could not have asked for better representation in Shoko and as someone with depression, I couldn't have asked for better representation than Ishida.If you haven't watched this yet, I highly recommend it."
"This animated film tells the story of a deaf girl who joins a school, but she quickly becomes the target of bullying. After she moves away, her bullies find ways to reconcile with themselves and with her.It is quite unexpected that an animation can be so deeply touching and contemplative. The emotions of the deaf girl and her main bully are well communicated. I can feel her pain, which is really something for an animation. The final climax made my palms sweat, and I had reach for tissues to wipe my palms! It is an intense, emotional and engrossing animation. I enjoyed watching it."
"Make no mistake, this is not the best movie out there, there are some people who were really into this movie so I'd begun watching it with high expectations, it didn't disappoint me after all.I can say everything is good about this movie, and most importantly, it succeeds at delivering the message, well let's say, many messages (Can't spoil). I liked everything about it, it is really good, but not the best, and sure as hell do I recommend it ! It felt a little bit long and it could've been shortened a little bit but no harm's been done. The ending was confusing, they could've invested a few more ideas on the ending.8/10"
"This is the first film that I've seen by Naoko Yamada and while in some ways I'm impressed in others I think it was gallant failure.Starting with the good, like most modern Japanese anime it looks great and at times simply stunning. The voice actors do a great job and at over two hours it's great value for money. It might also be worth mentioning at the screening I went to the cinema was about half full, which is a good turn out for a sub-titled animated feature.Unfortunately it's not a film that I particularly want to watch again and there a number of reasons for that. While I'm aware that it's based on a manga, it feels too long and I'm sorry to say depressing. Most of the characters are people that you wouldn't want to spend much time with and there is maybe only one scene that could be called funny. Also just because it's long doesn't mean that all the conflicts are going to be resolved.Don't get me wrong if you're an anime fan you're probably going to like this, but I can't see it appealing to a wider audience."
"I must say, amazing animations!HOWEVER,There is zero development on the side characters. ZERO.In the manga, each side character is explained and has their own backstory, and I think that adds much more meaning to the entire plot.Yuzuru is such a wonderful character yet only 10% of her concern and love for Shoko is shown in the movie. They never explain why she took photos of dead things. They never elaborated on her actions and words.Each one of Shouya's friends has their own backstory, however it's all thrown out the window and all we get are characters with random actions.The entire story would be better if made into a short series. A movie is simply too short to explain everything.Please just read the manga and don't watch the movie, you'd get a lot more out of it."
"You may have read so many reviews about this movie, I'll just say that I agree about the positive comments about the voice actors and of course the animation. Pure art. But, these are what I think that ruined the beautiful concept of the movie:1. So many things left void. For example Ueno's character resolution, the white haired guy's existence, etc;2. Character developments are complete dull. What I'm saying here is, so, Nagatsuka's role is just to comfort Ishida? I thought there would be some interesting background about him, that will somehow connect to Ishida's resolution. Another example, how about Kawai's? It's never clear that she still has that blame-for-my-own-benefit character;3. Well, I don't think that the director wanted this film a pure romance, but... Still, I think that would be good if AT LEAST Ishida replied back Shoya properly, about her confession earlier. It doesn't matter how, but that just would be better if being put explicitly. Why is it matter? I think the answer is simple, Shoya's love for Ishida was also the reason that she attempted suicide. She thought that because of her existence Ishida suffered, unhappy. So wouldn't it be nicer if that love matter being solved clearly in the end?4. The story is confusing. At first I thought that the ending will be Ishida and Shoya being together, but I guess it won't. Then I thought it will end with a beautiful resolution, that Ueno and the whoever dudes involved in the story from the past, get together along again in the friendship, but I guess that's wrong too. So what? I don't even understand why Ishida started to not able to see people's faces. I thought because Ishida's rumor that he was a bully was spreading, but I guess after people accepted him (in the end when Shoya walked him to his class), he still couldn't face them. So, what was the cause? Also didn't he just promised God that he won't run away from reality anymore if Shoya's save? Why would he just break that promise right after he made that promise? Well, I don't really get it.2 hours of waiting for resolution, in the end it just appeared that Ishida could finally see people's faces again.Really disappointed, because the concept is just already so beautiful, heartwarming, and unique for me.5 out of 10 because the concept is really beautiful, and Shoya's heart is just pure and heartwarming. I actually learned a lot from her about life."
"The movie is tremendously beautiful , the personalities of the characters are very realistic and well shaped ! The story is very realistic and it feels very real when you think of it . I recommend this movie to all of teens ! I really enjoined watching it and i will share it with every one i know !"
"I am surprised to see how highly critics and audiences have rated this film. I find this movie visually spectacular with nice music and it started on an interesting note. The storytellers of this film are sincere with themes like depression, heartbreak and isolation.
However, there is a list of things I would like to point to in which this film has fallen short: Firstly, the characters are not very relatable and in fact, even irritating. The boy as well as the deaf girl are unrelatable and difficult to root for. The deaf girl (Nishiyama), especially is hard to empathize with it because she is so emotionally weak and self-abhorring. The film treats her with so much admiration and respect when, honestly, I think there were other characters who I thought deserved more admiration and attention than her. 2) Also, I think that other characters like the dark-haired bully girl was more interesting because we could really have delved into the reasons of why she bullied Nishiyama, her insecurities. Howeve, the film mocks this character. Nishiyama, the deaf girl, on the other hand, is never criticized in that way for her self-pitying and her weakness but she is elevated. Perhaps, because they consider her sins to be a 'virtuous' kind whereas toher characters' sins are much heavier. This sort of discrimination seems unfair. Thirdly, the film felt overlong. I am okay with stories meandering a lot and exploring themes we do not expect, but this film stretches so much and SO MANY (god, so many) over-sentimental, melodramatic events occur (suicides, fights, crying) that by the time we have reached the end with the Ishida finally finding redemption, we don't care anymore. We are more relieved that the film is over than that he has become more open towards people in his school. I guess this is the fault with a lot of anime movies (like 'Your Name') that they are mushy and try to be too 'kawaii' (deaf, sweet girl meets her bully and changes his life, but she is stainless. She changes everyone's life, the girl is so cute with her signature smiles and pink hair). It is hard to take it seriously. I don't think stories of depressed teengaers with issues should be reduced to overly sentimental, cutes-y and cringey moments. Teenagers deserve a somber, more complex insight without promises of easy conclusions and redemption. 
Maybe I am being too hard on a movie that is obviously directed towards teens and pre-teens who love anime and enjoy kawaii moments with good-looking heroes and plainer side-kicks. If you love a good tear-jerker and love rom-com tropes this one is def for you. If you want a film that is more accurate about depression and isolation, and is dark and dry, instead of cliched, preachy and sentimental, STAY. AWAY."
"Yeah, this is a ""pretty"" movie. The animation is nice, the character designs are pretty solid, and the voice actors are all good in their own right. The problem with this movie isn't technical, because from a Visual aspect it's all very good. The issue is in it's main story, scratch that, it's with the main characters.The central plot device here is following the main character, Shoya, who ruthlessly bullied a deaf girl in elementary school until she was forced to switch schools. There are other characters too, a lot of other (to the movie's credit, believably written) characters who also partake in this cruelty, in what is a very well done portrayal of the escalation of torment for kids. The issue is what comes after, in which suddenly Shoya is supposed to be this sympathetic character. That's the chief problem, this movie tries to make you feel badly for someone who has no right to be pitied. It's about him trying to make amends, like that will undo everything and make the world all pretty again. Other characters are there too, and overall they all fall into this central theme, and problem, in that the film seems to assume that just because you feel ""Bad"" about something, that makes it okay.These characters go around acting like feeling bad because they were cruel justifies it, that just because they're ""sorry"" they're suddenly absolved of sin. The film milks this dry and keeps trying to kick you in the gut, but it fails because there's no way this mentality can be sympathized with. Feeling sorry for yourself because you were a bully doesn't render your actions void, it doesn't make everything better, and the damage they've caused never goes away. As much as the film wants you to think that everyone is secretly good, it never gives me reason to believe as such. They haven't learned anything, they're just as selfish and mean as they used to be, they just learned how to make it SEEM different. One of the characters hates Shoko (The deaf girl), slaps her repeatedly, tells her that she hates her TO HER FACE, blames her for her problems, and then suddenly at the end we're supposed to think she's good just because she feels bad later. In conclusion, it's a visually engaging film, but it's skewed perspective of ""redemption"" drags it down and makes it impossible to empathize with anything it presents."
"This is the next best anime in the recent time after 'Your Name'. Not that you know this director very well, not at the international level. But with a film like this, she's going to be. This is another teen romance. Well, romance is not exactly a word that matches with what this film is about narrative, but there's no other way to describe its theme. It was like before romance, that mean before committing to a relationship and after you had started to like someone while fixing the mistakes made in the past.It's a high school tale. Before that, it opened with a brief flashback of the elementary school events, where Shoya Ishida bullied a new admission Shoko Nishimiya for her hearing impairment. Soon after that, she'd transferred to another school. Now, a few years later, they meet again in the high school, where Ishida tried to fix what he had done wrong a while ago for her. So a relationship develops, despite people around them does not understand their commitment. At some point, it will be tested, which might lead to uncover their true feeling to one another.This is surely aimed at the teen audience. Especially, the romance and sentimental parts are intended for the youngsters, but anyone would enjoy it. So, I felt them, but not like I'm still young. Otherwise, I would have said it is a masterpiece. That's only from the story perspective. The sketches and animations were not bad. The film characters were awesome. Each one was very unique and different people pick different characters as their favourite. I liked Yuzuru as I always like tomboyish type roles. But obviously Ishida and Shoko make this film.❝Please don't make such a serious face. And, let me say... I am sorry.❞Smooth animation. Technically comparable with any big names (anime titles). That also means the director is now in the league of the best anime-maker. She's young and I hope she keeps doing more films. As I said many times before, that after Hayao Miyazaki retired from making films, we need more people like this filmmaker to fill that empty space. The film won many awards for its great achievement, as well as box office success in the domestic market. Expecting the rest of the world and anime fans to receive it at the same extent.It was originally based on the manga of the same name, and a television series was made before this feature anime. As I collect film quotes, the best ones, I was disappointed on that context. There were many emotionally and romantically appealing lines, but not on the moral perception. That does not mean the film lacks the social consciousness. In fact, the film highlights the bullying and its severe consequences. That alone is enough, this is a must see for the school kids.Surely kids, teens and some youngsters would love it, but as far as the adults, this is not an ideal thematic, yet you can't ignore its artistry and the intention of the film. Sometimes it might help you to like it in the second viewing. Because this is one of those kind. My issue was understanding the Japanese sign language. Besides, the subtitle for that was not much helpful, as it was exactly translated as what the hearing impaired character babbled which is an alternate spelling for every word and sentence.I had lots of fun watching it, as well as other moods like romantic, touching, annoyance, but overall it leans towards the good side. Just over two hours, it never looked too slow or hurried in the story or the character developments. Could be the best to pick as a date flick or get together with your school friends, particularly opposite sex friends. My final saying is, it is not to be missed for many reasons I've mentioned in this review and the other one is it being an anime, a quality one.7/10"
"I'll start by admitting that I'm not very familiarized with the anime movie genre in general, even less so with titles that are mainly dramas. That said I did have a previous experience with an amazing dramatic/romantic anime movie, ""Omohide poro poro"" - Only Yesterday, which until this date is one of the most remarkable movies I ever saw. With that in mind I was curious about this movie, because I kept hearing good things about it, and how it handled such delicate themes like bullying and depression. Now, regarding the movie itself, personally, I found it to be a big lackluster in many aspects, and the overall, over-the-top, melodramatic tone almost made the movie unbearable at some points. I'll briefly summarize what main issues I had: 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: I felt like there were too many characters, and most of them were underdeveloped. Most of the time I was struggling to understand the motivation behind their behaviors and reactions because their personalities/traits/goals were not well established. 𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐞: I know that the main demographic for this movie are teenagers, but still, I couldn't help to feel that the way they handled delicate issues like depression/anxiety/bullying is so overtly melodramatic that it almost rips the seriousness out them. When I saw ""Only Yesterday"", I felt the tone managed to be nostalgic, serious and whimsical, showcasing great balance and attention to detail to portray emotion. Now, with ""Koe no Katachi"" I felt like I was constantly being force- fed ""emotional"" scenes and dialogue, just for the sake of ""feels"". 𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐜: Some of my favorite movie scores of all time are from anime movies (e.g. My Neighbour Totoro; Howl's Moving Castle, and many other). That being said, I found this soundtrack to be pretty forgettable, and at some points it even added to the overall over- the-top melodramatics. 𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: The animation was, to me, the only redeeming aspect of this movie. There are a couple of great scenes that present really nice details that manage to illustrate the importance of non-verbal communication in human relationships.To wrap up, I want to disclose that perhaps I'm just not used to watch anime dramas, and perhaps all the tropes and details I found annoying are just part of the style itself. That being said, I would recommend people to watch ""Only Yesterday"", a film that maybe is responsible for my ""anime drama"" expectations bar being raised too high."
"A truly emotional work with mesmerizing animations dissecting the phases of life from adolescence to early adulthood focusing mainly on bullying,social anxiety,repentance and acceptance with brilliant writing that has great understanding of emotions and characters. It takes time,traveling in a slow pace,to explore its characters from the very beginning to build a strong emotional connection throughout that never seems forced or pointless rather more matured and effective."
"Words alone cannot describe how much I was hooked onto this dramatic story.'Koe no Katachi' (or A Silent Voice) revolves around Shoya, a 12-year-old boy in junior high who is at odds with a disabled girl named Shoko in his class since she is unable to speak clear sentences and can only use Sign Language to communicate. When one of his teasings finally gets out of hand, it affects his social life greatly as an older teen. Hoping to seek redemption and repent over his past, he finds Shoko again years later and tries to make amends for himself and those he hurt.After seeing Makoto Shinkai's 'Your Name,' I see what Shinkai meant when he described this film as an interesting piece of work that he cannot easily replicate. Creator Yoshitoki Oima and director Naoko Yamada sure brought these characters to life with both depth and emotion. Even with the use of Sign Language, it has this sense of realism as it's being shown. The imagery involving physical abuse, suicide, and inner turmoil were things I couldn't imagine be pulled off this dramatically well in an anime film. For a runtime of a little over two hours, it's definitely a must-see from beginning to end. Whether you're into Japanese animation or not, the story is what really matters as it can pertain to real-life as well.Shoya's predicament had me reflecting on my own life at a young age too. Through pride and vanity comes damaging repercussions on one's own outlook. I had my share of regrets and if I could take any of them back, I wouldn't hesitate. It sure had me thinking of the social follies in some people.The moral: The past cannot be changed, but discover that there's more to life than just hurting those around oneself by starting anew."
"One of the best films i've seen in a long time...I cannot recommend it enough. A story about a bully who in turn gets bullied and his path to make amends with the one he had wronged, in the process learning the meaning of friendship. Somehow this story is able to tackle multiple issues (interacting with deafness, bullying, suicide, loneliness, friendship, young love) through the awkwardness of adolescence with such honesty and without out being heavy-handed or losing focus."
"I feel so guilty 4 not watching it be4, cuz it was such a emotional & expertly written movie. I even cried a couple of times thru it & that's rare 4 me 2 cry during movies. The only other movies I've ever recalled crying at were E.T., The Green Mile & Dances with Wolves.But this movie is next level, trust! It tackles issues that aren't common in the animation world, let alone anime world, including disabilities (in the case o' this film, primarily deafness & troubling eye contact), suicidal thoughts, social anxiety & bullying. All these subjects R done in a masterful way & given I myself have sum disabilities, it was really hard-hitting 2 me. This was a film that made me feel better about who I am & that I shouldn't let any negative aspects of myself get in the way of my own self-being. I myself create & write a lot of characters wit disabilities, so this movie pretty much gave me more motivation 2 work wit them.So, pretty much - gorgeous animation, great characters, a story wit a huge emotional impact & subject matters that IMO really need 2 B looked at more in animation & anime.If U haven't watched it, I suggest U go & do that right now, as it is truly something special.In other words, it's a 10/10 modern masterpiece"
"A silent voice is a beautiful film that leaves us with a great message of how we treat people, what we give is what we will receive one day and our actions can affect not only our future but that of the people around us. In summary a beautiful redemption movie, and friendship ties."
"I've been a fan of animation all my life. It was only natural to move from after school cartoons to more sophisticated anime as I got older. Although, to be honest, not all anime is sophisticated. A lot of it - and a lot of the stuff I choose to watch - is flat out silly. This, however, is not the case for A Silent Voice.To the contrary, A Silent Voice is a much different, more serious sort of anime. Which brings me to some content warning: this movie deals with bullying as well as suicidal ideation. Although it is handled well, it can still be upsetting at times.Shoko Nishimiya is the new girl in school and while she looks as normal as everyone else, she has one major difference - she's deaf. Unfortunately, this sets her up for bullying by her classmates, leaving her feeling ostracized and alone. Despite this, Shoko never stops trying to make friends and to be a part of the group. Things escalate and Shoko is eventually transferred to another school in hopes of giving her a better experience. Sadly, this is all too common in our schools these days. Kids can be the cruelest of people at times. Brutal honesty at its harshest.Fast forward to high school. Shoya Ishida, formerly one of Shoko's biggest tormentors, finds himself on the other side of the fence. After helping another loner being harassed by a bully, Shoya decides to search out Shoko in an attempt to redeem his past self.He has a long road ahead of him because he was quite awful to Shoko in elementary school. However, years of being a social outcast have changed him. Shoya's no longer able to look others in the eye and has no one he can call a friend. Reuniting with Shoko changes everything for both himself and for Shoko and her family. Slowly, they begin to build a lasting friendship that they never had the chance to start in elementary school.Beautifully animated, A Silent Voice is mesmerizing both visually and emotionally. I often found myself laughing one moment at one of Tomohiro Nagatsuka's antics and sobbing the next. Every time a red x fell from someone's face, I felt my heart skip with joy for Shoya. Dark, and yet full of hope, this is a movie for families to watch together, or for friends to share with one another. It's all too true to reality which only makes it more of a must-see movie. I saw so much of my own high school days in these characters, making me connect even more to them all in one way or another. Parent or not, teen or not, I think most of us will be able to relate to the story of A Silent Voice."
"I started this movie without any context and expecting a romantic story like many anime movies.This story really goes beyond and shows a beautiful picture of depression, anxiety and learning about self-love.
Even though a great part of the story is between the two main characters and their relationships together, the main focus is the protagonist, Shoya, and his dealing with the consequences of his actions and his own mind.
It's beautiful to see how well portrayed depression is. From the fact that he can't look people in the eyes, to how he can't believe he's allowed to have fun or friends at all.But maybe the best part is, in a heart-warming way, how he's able to break from his struggles and let himself be happy again. In the last scene, when he finally let's his own isolation go and allows himself to see and hear everyone, you can feel the wave of emotions it brings to him and how you have actually reached the happy ending.TL;DR An amazing movie with a great story, great characters, beautiful animation and soundtrack; full of emotions with a non-conventional way of portraying love towards others and yourself."
