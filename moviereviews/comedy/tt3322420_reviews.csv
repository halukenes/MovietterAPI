"Wanna experience a hot air balloon ride? If not literally, Vikas Bahl's 'Queen' will surely give you the feel! This one too takes off after fire of strife but gradually zooms up in the air higher and higher, all liberated from the shackles of earthly rules and grief. 'Queen' is a journey of discovering oneself. Simply put – ""When things go wrong, cry not; gather your guts, not just move over but fly!"". A more detailed analysis follows: Plot: The plot resembles Gauri Shinde's 'English vinglish' in its theme but it is the execution and premises which makes 'Queen' more exuberant. While the former was poised and mature, this one is raw, yet sensitive, sensible, effervescent, all at the same time. How an otherwise banal story on paper could become so entertaining on-screen, only Bahl can tell. He injected the same positivity in his debut venture 'Chillar party' earlier. Another endearing fact is the handling of 'haww'-type (by Indian sanskriti standards) cheeky humor gracefully enough to make it watchable with family. Dialogues by Anvita Dutt and Kangana (yes, she has contributed here too) are pertinent. Despite lot of French and little Japanese here & there (with no subtitles), you don't mind as the situation and emotions say it all. Dilliwali Punjabi lingo, though, adds credibility. Heartiest congratulations to Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane for shelling put money for such a cinematic delight! Cast: It is out and out Kangana's film, with all others in supporting role. Bahl is believable in saying he penned Rani's role keeping only her in mind. No other actress would have better lived the vulnerability, innocence, craziness, elegance and emotions of Rani, the way Kangana did. This movie will definitely mark as a milestone in her career and give all reasons to other filmmakers to look beyond her fashionistic persona. Donning demure, no make-up, plaited look and wearing kurti with sweaters, she looks perfectly the Indian girl next door. At the climax too, she looks glamorous not out of the dress but the confidence she wears! Full marks to casting directors as all actors play within the skin of their respective characters, be it the confused Rajkkumar Rao, Rani's family (Dadi is esp. lovable), sensuous smart Lisa Hayden or Rani's endearing firangi friends. Cinematography: On Rani's canvas, you get to move from rues of Lajpat Nagar to the majestic Eifel Tower to the picturesque bridges of Amsterdam! Kudos to Siddharth Diwan and Bobby Singh for the awesome camera work! Music: Amit Trivedi is a winner all the way. Already hit ""London thumakda"" gives way to ""Ranjha"", classical pop 'Badra bahaar' and 'O gujariya'. However, it is the remixed ""Hungama ho gaya"" from 'Anhonee' (1973) rendered emphatically by ever boisterous Asha Bhosle, which stays with you even after you leave the theatre. Songs are nowhere a speed- breaker in this flick. Flaws: I failed to find any. :)The film ends with a confident rejuvenated Rani thanking her betrayer for giving her the opportunity for self-awakening; we as audience thank the director for infusing optimism into the minds and hearts of esp. female watchers. Go ladies, this one's the best Woman's day gift you can give to yourself. Men too will surely enjoy it for all its youthfulness. It's a movie for all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My rating: ****1/2 (my favourite in the last 1 year)P.S.: Ending credential FB ishtyle are not to be missed!"
"QUEEN is directed by Vikas Bahl, starring Kangana Ranaut, in the lead role, along with Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Haydon.The film revolves around Rani (Kangana Ranaut), an innocent Punjabi girl, who gets dumped one day before her wedding day. She gets an idea to go on her honeymoon all by herself, and that very trip shows her road to self-empowerment while going through several comical situations...The trailer of Queen didn't quite attract much attention, therefore, the film was extremely underrated by several critics, including me. However, the songs did grab a portion of my attention, so I was curious to know whether I was looking at Queen from a wrong angle. The film, itself, faced fierce competition from Madhuri-Juhi starrer, Gulaab Gang and the much-awaited Total Siyapaa. However, the reviews came in for the three films, and I was shocked to see so much praise for Queen. So I decided to go with the critics and chose Queen over Total Siyapaa that weekend. And I think its safe for me to say that it is one of the best decisions I've made in my life (and it might be yours too).Queen starts off in the most mainstream desi way possible. The Big Fat Indian Wedding with relatives at every nook and corner and dance to Punjabi tunes is galore. The calling off of the wedding takes place and you feel yourself going through the very same events as Rani. This is due to pure direction and acting. However, the film takes a VERY sharp turn when she leaves for her honeymoon. Rani meets new friends, goes through life how a woman should, and I think it was a smart move on the director to release it on Women's Day, because at the end of the film, the message is pretty clear. However, I shall not go on further about the plot, because after she leaves India, its all just fun.The acting is just top-notch. Kangana Ranaut, in all honesty, carries the film on her shoulders throughout the 2h30m run time. She portrays her character with such finesse that she deserves awards and utter praise for it. Rajkummar Rao played a great job as well and the rest of the foreign actors were just delightful and splendid to see.The songs are great as well. Amit Trivedi also deserves applause for the great music as well as background score. Every single song captures a theme of the film and just blends perfectly with the several scenes in the film. It helps you feel like Rani while she goes through her journey. 'London Thumakada' captures the Indian Wedding Theme, while 'O Gujariya' is just great to listen to. A special mention about the remake of 'Hungama Ho Gaya' which is just complete fun to listen to.In conclusion, QUEEN is possibly one of the best films of the year. I can't seem to see any flaw in the film; it is just complete fun. Go watch it; I highly recommend it.QUEEN- 10/10"
Its not every year (or sometimes even years) that you come across a bollywood flick that stays with you for days after you watched it. Queen is one such film that will make you want to watch it again.The story is similar in theme to English Vinglish (Yet another masterpiece) but stands out in execution and story telling.Kangana Ranaut delivers her career best in Queen no doubt.I was actually there on location in Amsterdam sometime in September 2012 when they were filming the last scene where she runs down the bridge to meet her friends at the rock show. The simplicity of the set and all involved was an indication of a good film which i later found out was to be named 'Queen' Watch it right away and you will leave the hall with a smile.
"Kangana Ranaut delivers a performance that marks her light years ahead of any of her contemporaries. She conveys most through her pitch-perfect body language. And even in her dialogues she gets the right tonality for it all. 'Queen' might be the birth of a legend and thank God for that! If Kangana was exemplary, a large part of the success of it can be attributed to Bahl. He had done the detailing of the film with a hawk like precision. I won't be surprised if the director had already painted in his head the image of how he will pursue every scene and every slide in the film.'Queen' is easily one of the most accomplished films made in a long time. The skillful direction of Vikas and Kangana's easy virtuoso makes this one an indulgent affair."
"Sit Back, Relax, and Enjoy the Joyride that Kangana a.k.a. Queen takes us through. However, the ride wouldn't be same without the supporting characters; all of them detailed really well. The ride wouldn't also be same without the Rocking music of Amit Trivedi. And How can I not mention Vikas Bahl here? Quality Direction;Quality Screenplay. Too many names; too little space. With Big names such as Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane involved in Editing and Production as well; the product had to be Top Notch.A movie that would require the audience to connect with the Lead Character; eventually got me connected to all the characters, including Vijay played by Rajkummar Rao. I am sure most guys (at-least in their heads) can relate to that lad.Some scenes were executed perfectly. Some Punchlines were too good. Kudos to the whole Team.Kangana gave it all in this movie. She was immersed deep in the character. Her dialogue delivery;her posture;her expressions. One of the finest performances I have seen by any Bollywood Actress in Long time.From the right perspective; you can see that Queen has many messages. Highlights the issue that women do face in this country. Don't tell me i am wrong ; THEY DO.Overall; A MUST WATCH. Salute to the QUEEN."
"8th March is International Women's Day and Queen celebrates it with panache. When Rani played amazingly brilliant by Kangana Ranaut discovers herself on her solo honeymoon trip in Paris and Amsterdam, she comes back to India with a winning smile on her face. The same smile is pasted on your face throughout the movie. There is hardly any feminine emotion left that is not being touched upon in this witty, gritty, funny, emotional and very subtle cinematic portrayal of finding that a woman is more than being a mother, a sister or a wife. The movie talks in the language of love and affection which is not bound by the country in which you were born. All foreign characters here, be it Indian French single mother, the child-like Japanese guy, the European artist, the French restaurant owner or the black guy here play true to their cultures and don't seem fake at all. After Kangana, movie belongs to writer-director Vikas Bahl who shall be remembered now forever for penning this neat story and screenplay flooded with so many fresh and out of box ideas. So don't wait, go and experience the fun (read hungama) with your friends. It is one of the finest cinematic work of Bollywood. Period."
"This film is a good example of Director's clarity of mind regarding characterization, mood of scenes and way of approach. Director Mr Vikas Bahl work is fantastic. In spite of very thin story line he projected this movie in a very unique, interesting and entertaining way. This movie speaks less and shows maximum. Screenplay is average. Dialogues by Anvita Dutt and Kangana Ranaut are very good. Even very average scenes are so good just because of expression and the way of taking the scene i.e When Rani goes on stage for dance, she copies other dancers and removes her sweater, rolls it like them but in spite of throwing it like them she keeps it in her bag. The way she struggles with the bag snatcher that this average scene comes out a laughter riot. Director inserted some flash back between the scene, which enhanced the scene very well and also projected some different emotions. Even the small characters are minutely observed . In a scene Rani goes to meet her family friend in Paris but that family ladies discuss about the money given to her just for a good luck or rituals. They minimize the amount because Rani is a distant relative. When Rani lives in Paris with her wonderful room mates, in this complete sequence Rani is wondered so director chose a T-shirt for Rani with quotation Alice in wonderland. This quotation clearly reflects Rani state of mind. Director never goes over board and never let the actors go over board. So, interest and entertainment remain intact. Of course Director has been supported by fantastic performance of actors. Kangana Ranaut is out standing. No one could have have performed better than her. Raj Kumar Yadav is OK. Lisa Haydon as Vijaylaxmi is fantastic. All actors are very good including Rani's Paris room mates. Music by Amit Trivedi suits the mood of film."
"Today is international women's day and this movie is a perfect gift. Kangna acts super fantastic with her cute expressions as a typical Desi girl who loves her family, gets over the fear and humiliation of no marriage and lives her own life to the full. First half is very pleasant, Lisa has a good comeback to this movie and impresses well. ""London Thumukda"" song makes audience tap their feet once. I had no idea that Kangna can live up to this mark, her appearance is quite impressive and i guess every Indian girl will like her. If you are assuming her to be the same as in ""Tanu weds Manu"", you are mistaken. You will not be disappointed. My rating: 8/10"
"QUEEN - We hardly get woman oriented movies in Bollywood,,,,and most of them does disastrous business at box office....but our country kind of started liking woman oriented movies after superlative No One Killed Jessica,,,,and then comes Kahani..... Both of these movies create some space for heroins in Bollywood to get movies for them only.... But they too are not commercial movies,,,,being thriller they have limited audience,,,,so we want some light hearted movie and guess what we got English WINGLISH,,,,a perfect example of light hearted woman oriented film.....Queen goes on the same track of English Winglish but has crossed it...... Vikash Bhal (director of Chillar party) on his second directorial venture has taken care of each and every scenes of the movie.....There is a scenes where Kangana gives French toast to a french person in breakfast and the person replied m from France and there is nothing like french toast there ,, so Kangana replied 'Ye Sirf India Mein Milta Hei'...... You can laugh 100 times on such jokes,,,,,they are written with such cute humour...... There is another scenes where Kangana run out of the bathroom screaming after seeing a lizard and feel like a fool,,,,but when three of the boys who are her roommates also get scared Kangana take a deep breath with happiness and say 'Savi Dar Gaye',,,,.....Such cute scenes are rare in bollywood...... Story is simple,,,Kangana ' s Mangetar says he will not marry her a day before there marriage and with frustration Kangana decided to go to her Honeymoon alone..... So a girl who barely cross road in India without anyone's help in going to Paris alone.....Here is start of interesting session..... Most of the Bollywood movies make u laugh in there first half and become melodramatic in the second half like what happened in case of Ye Jawani Hei Dewani and a little bit in case of Shaadi Ke Side effect,,,,,but Queen is something far from being melodramatic..... Infect we have a very few films in Bollywood which can make u laugh from start till end despite of some emotional scenes in between those laughs.....Queen is one of the best among them..... To talk about Kangana m speechless,,,,she has always done glamorous roles in Bollywood but she walks into the shoes of such anti glamorous character of Rani with ease.....She has proved that she is far far ahead of the other actresses of her league....Get warned other actresses..... Lisa as the french friend of Rani is too good....Infect she has something great in comparison to what she last did in the movie RASCAL.....When she left Kangana on her way to Amsterdam u wish that she would have gone with her..... The three Roommates of Rani in Amsterdam are perfect...... Vikash Bhal need special mention,,,,,he has crafted every scene with his heart in it.....Casting was so perfect...... Songs goes with the mood of the movie.....Not a single song is wasted,,,,,or stop the flow of the movie,,,,my favorite are O Gujariya and Harjaniya....... I cant say that editing is bad but the movie could have been small,,,,that doesn't mean it will bore u...... So its the first film in 2014 to which m giving more then 3.75 .... M going for 4.25 out of 5...... Its a must watch for every body on this women's day occasion..... By ANuP APu KuMaR"
"Well well well, what do i tell you about Vikas Bahl & Kangana Ranaut. They have done excellent justice to the movie. Nobody could have played ""Rani- The Queen"" better than her. She is absolutely marvelous and a plain delight to watch.Its a simple story about a simple girl who is dumped by her fiancé a day before their marriage and she leaves for her ""honeymoon"" all by herself. There she discovers life and herself amongst people she hardly knows and befriends.Watch it for a stunning performance by Kangana who is nothing less than ""Vidya Bagchi"" as she carries the film on her own shoulders and for its super fine direction.P.S : I wish Kangana's father would watch this film. He'd be really proud of his daughter."
"GO and WATCH this movie in theater. Bollywood needs high quality movies like this, which are not only meaningful but also provide full entertainment and fun without appearing pretentious/ fake. These are the kind of movies that need to make money so that producers invest in them.I feel a bit out-of-league reviewing this movie. When all the movie critics and stalwarts of Bollywood such as Karan Johar and Aamir Khan have highly praised this movie and Kangana Ranaut's performance in almost unanimous voice, it really leaves one with nothing more to say. So I am going to only mention few things in more detail.Ranaut's performance: One of the best performances to come out of Hindi cinema in several years, this is not about shedding tears, yelling, looking cute/ gorgeous or dancing (which interestingly accounts for ""good acting"" for most Indian audience). It is marked by subtleties, such as faintly raised eyebrows, shrunk nose, narrowed eyes, aversive gaze, awkwardly positioned arms/ legs, contorted body, crestfallen face, shadow of a smirk, etc. Even when she cries, her wailing makes you wonder if you are really watching an act? Ranaut, who in real life is well-known as a fashionista, has transformed her body language, her mannerisms and her expressions completely for this role. One thing is certain - it is hard to imagine any other actress in this role and hard to imagine this movie without Kangana Ranaut as Rani.Vikas Bahl's direction: The credit also goes to the director, Vikas Bahl. Without him, the movie could have been a wreck. The movie has a very simple plot and is therefore not an easy story to make a movie with. But Bahl manages to steer clear of all traps for derailment that the story provides. The movie may seem a bit slow in the middle, but then, without sufficient time to develop the emotions and attitude of the character, the movie would not be as effective. He is also one of the very few directors who have managed to utilize Ranaut's potential as an artist. I heard in an interview that Bahl allowed Ranaut creative freedom, allowing her even to pen her own dialogs for some parts of the movie - wish all those control freaks out there are hearing! Story/ Screenplay/ Dialog: Rani's challenges in this story are not hers alone - they are the trials of every person, man or woman, who has felt diffident owing to their cultivated nature or low-spirited when bowed down by circumstances. This is a story of gaining perspective and discovering one's potential through travel, cross-cultural exposure and external support. That is why the story is so meaningful for every person. One of the reasons the movie works is because it has realistic dialog - dialog as Indians use in normal daily life, nothing cheesy that Hindi movies are so used to. Music: The movie is aptly supported by Amit Trivedi's foot-tapping and innovative score. That said, if I could, I would either eliminate some songs or shorten them just to reduce the length of the movie. Entertainment factor: Make no mistake, this is NOT an ""art film"" or parallel cinema. This is a highly entertaining and fun movie that also happens to be high quality and meaningful. Though the protagonist of the movie is a woman, the movie is equally entertaining for all men and women."
"To All the Bollywood fan's you should watch QUEEN not because it has a good story no it doesn't the plot has been used numerous times but the journey of Kangana from a shy obedient Rajouri Garden Delhi Girl to a confident open minded today's modern girl is quite awesome. The small moments the little subplots that define Kangana's character is brilliantly written and filmed. Bollywood often becomes predictable but this movie isn't, u ll never be able to guess that such subplots would appear. The dancing of drunk Kangana in front of police scene, the sex toy shop scene, the boob pressing scene there are many more. Kangana's acting is brilliant even the side characters have played their part perfectly. Amit Trivedi's Music as always is amazing it suits the movie there are brilliant songs within the movie which has not been promoted in trailers plus oh Gujariya and Hungama Hogaya would rock any party. Director Vikas Bahl does a brilliant job. Only part where they could have done better is cinematography it is average. This movie falls in the category of very few good women centric movies that Bollywood has created and you can count them on your fingertips. Consistently entertaining i am going with 8/10 rating for this movie do watch it."
"The acting is just top-notch. Kangana Ranaut, in all honesty, carries the film on her shoulders throughout the 2h30m run time. She portrays her character with such finesse that she deserves awards and utter praise for it.Every single song captures a theme of the film and just blends perfectly with the several scenes in the film. It helps you feel like Rani while she goes through her journey.Possibly one of the best films of the year. I can't seem to see any flaw in the film; it is just complete fun. Go watch it; I highly recommend it."
"Queen (Hindi): The Phantom Productions are back with a bang this year after their fresh romance in ""Hasee Toh Phansee"" with the story of a typical Punjabi girl whose journey causing the change of her real identity which has been shown brilliantly in the film which has shades of films like ""Jab We Met"" , ""Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara"" and even some of the Satyajit Ray's films like ""Charulata"" and ""Mahanagar"" . Hatsoff to director Vikas Behl for showing the brilliant character development of the protagonist (played by Kangana Ranaut) from Rani to Queen which scores in its riveting screenplay (Behl, Parveez Sheikh and Chaitily Parmar) along with crackling dialogues (Anvita Dutt and Kangana Ranaut), the cinematography by Bobby Singh and Siddharth Diwan actually reminds of the film 'Dev D' and it captures the locales beautifully along with the moments in the film and then comes the music score by Amit Trivedi which is simply fabulous and scores in making the narrative flow like anything. In the performances, the foreign cast (Bokyo Mish, Jeffery Ho and Joseph Guitobh) are simply superb and riveting. Rajkummar Rao and Lisa Hayden provide shoulder brilliantly to the protagonist and it's development. Last but not the least, it's Kangana Ranaut who brilliantly carries the film on her shoulders and she repeats her brilliance what we saw in films like ""Gangster"" and ""Fashion"" and she comes out as a real winner and a real Queen. Despite some draggy moments, director Behl's narration succeeds in making the film worth a watch for some fresh cinematic experience. My rating would be: 4/5."
"Every moment I was just hoping that it shouldn't come to an end! This movie bring smile to your face. Very very well done Kangna.I would give it 100/10 if I could. The simplicity of it to really touch people is just unbelievable. One word, MESMERISING.I just want to watch it forever. This movie deserves 10 times more money than bullshit Dhoom 3. To bad it's just cutting the edge of the budget. The story, direction, acting everything is perfect. Just perfect.I don't have enough words to describe the amazing experience. Whoever said this was a genius, ""this movie is a tight slap to the Indian men who want to westernise but still want their sisters and wives to be typical Indian."""
"movie review : QUEEN Story of a gal who faces her fears and the fake sympathy that comes after a failed marriage and goes on to learn the most important lessons of life. Once she decides to get out of her comfort zone, the magic happens. She learns, lives the unthinkable. She makes friends, lives in a male dorm and goes on to kiss an Italian guy, all sober and in full senses. Now my hope from this film is that young women of our country will see the movie and realize the meaning of freedom and importance of decision making. Travelling provides you the opportunity of doing all that. It makes u stronger and confident. If u want to grow, don't wait for a failure in life but go ahead and move out of ur comfort zone because that is where the magic Happens.."
"Take stunning performances from Kangana Ranaut (and all her co-actors), brilliant direction and a crisp-smart 21st century storyline... Mix it with spoonfuls of Parisian streets, Champs-Élysées, Tour Eiffel, Sacre-Couer, River Seine and Pont de l'Archevêché . Stir well with Amsterdam Canal Ring, Canal Cruises, Tram-rides, glimpses of Rembrandtplein, Red Light District, Sex shops and last but not the least, the famed THE BULLDOG COFFEESHOP.. And there you go. your delicious dish of a new-age bollywood entertainment is ready to be servedAll hail the ""Queen""!!!!"
"Do you like to laugh? Do you like to cry? Do you like to be surprised.
This is the film.
An Indian queen does the unexpected and meets many surpriding events but with a happy ending. She is beautiful gorgeous and fertile but has to travel solo. She does it and wins the world.
One reason all men only love beautiful fertile Indian women. Other women cannot compete for the attention of Indian men. Another reason shy (and lady like Indian women) need to speak up and be more proud"
"I had high expectation from the movie as it was rated 9 on IMDb. Everybody praising the movie and I disliked the movie. I watched the movie twice just to make sure that I am not missing something. The story was straight forward and little different from others. That was the only thing I found good about Queen. I find that like many other bollywood movies, the director doesn't believe in logic. All the technicalities have gone for a toss. It includes all known jokes. I really do not understand Why people have liked the movie. The movie tries to show empowerment of a girl and how do they show it by simply lowering the standard to start with. A Delhi girl who is scared to cross streets in Paris ( was she not crossing much crowded streets in Delhi? ) , Speaks continuously in Hindi. Rukhrsar(Roxette) comes to Amsterdam to study because they had no money(BOLLYWOOD LOGIC). Every scene follows some cliché. Gol gappe scene, the web cam scene, the sex toys shop scene etc were too predictable. For me there was nothing extra-ordinary in movie."
"Very slow and predictable. I guess if you have nothing better to do, you could fast forward and finish the movie in say, an hour. A repetition of several American movies seen over the last 2-3 generations. The main actress seems like she's uncomfortable speaking both Hindi and English ! Very odd. I've heard she won some awards due to her tantrums. Also because she's hit her mid 30's but shaves off 6 years from her age for publicity and to do these younger roles. Whatever. An average performance, at best. Dull. Might actually be terribly relevant to Indians in India. But unnatural for folks whose families left India 3-4 generations ago, precisely so they don't have these ridiculous situations. The actress also considers herself some sort of women's rights beacon but that's hard to buy given her average performances, odd comments to the press and insecurities with the performances and success of other actors and actresses. Don't waste your time."
"There are not many reviews which cover how bad this movie was and so I felt compelled to write one. For one, a rating of 9.1/10 on IMDb. Its an insult to the entire film making industry. Off late specially for the Bollywood movies people are being able to rig the ratings on IMDb as well at least for a short duration which is sad.Coming to the point...everything is fine till Rani lands in Paris. Within a few sequences she completely forgets that she is in Paris and starts talking in Hindi with almost everyone...LOL. So the character is not conservative she lacks common sense and downright stupid. And then she has the guts to travel in dark and deserted alleys and is surprised to hear that the stewardess has a child without marriage...Give me a break..perhaps they did not have a television also at their home or was she from the 50's. I am not sure if the Rajouri they are referring to is in Delhi.If it was Delhi, its an insult to the Delhites. The director tries all these gimmickry to evoke sympathy for the character of Rani but sadly there is none. In fact, the sheer stupidity that the character portrays evokes contempt for her.It's evident why so many people have rated this movie highly as they take it to be female empowerment. Going on a binge is not becoming assertive or becoming empowered it only shows the weakness and shallowness of character."
"This maybe the worst movie i've ever seen,only reason i watched it is because of its high rating and i believe a kid can make a better movie this is pure crap IMO.Most reviews here i believe who rated 10/10 are all female for sure.Just imagine a kid trying to make his first ""foreign-place movie"" who has no idea about the world and cultures and has it all mixed up in his head and this is what you get. Amazingly inaccurate and confusing settings and like only few critics said, dumb story.When the heroin lands in Paris i guess she forgot its a foreign country and start speaking to everyone in Hindi!what rubbish,and how could someone hailed from delhi all of a sudden afraid to cross the street in Paris Oh my God very laughable. If there is an award for worst movie, nothing can compete with this.One of the most ridiculous film I've ever seen how come it got 8/8 rating, looks like looks like the voters were force by aliens to rate it this high."
"Its all about movie actress queen, heart of film lovely actress Kangna , She must get Filmare award for her role, She did very well role i really loved her, how she manage situation with her innocent face and dialogue show that real Indian girl which is well discipline and belongs to well cultured, Apart from actress i really enjoyed songs and role played by her friends all of them are amazing, its look new actor but they showed talent beyond and language is not issue for all of them, how they express their feeling on movie they don't need words, its just amazing new guys.Finally, I would say that just go and must watch movie .Enjoy life with Fullest!!!"
"Kangana's performance is simply outstanding. One of the best movie of the millennium. Must watch movie of the decade. It's simple and clear to understand. Outstanding performances by the actors. Queen is irresistible. Highly recommended. A must see film. You will leave the theater with your heart humming happily. There isn't a moment in this cozy and charming film when you aren't smiling. The writers are the kings of this Queen; they've made every character so real. Kangana displays a surprising capacity for both comedy and emotion. As Rani, she displays amazing vulnerability and depth that very few performers can pull off. She is a delight - be it in the drunken scene, the ride back home in the rickshaw after she has been dumped, or fighting off a mugger on a street."
****Spoiler alert *****This is really a disrespect to entire film industry that such non-sense movie is rated 8.9 on IMDb. Anyway few generic points I disagree ... 1) People blamed Slumdog Millionaire for showing wrong (poverty and dirty places etc) side of India. Then we should blame Queen like movies for showing dirty side of foreign (Europe). 2) Directer only tried to get sympathy for Rani's character throughout the film ... most of the scenes does not make any sense to me. Why she visits some places? How she lands up in a hostel in Amsterdam? etc. 3) Best part I liked is ... Rani is from India and she could not cross a street in Paris ... thats the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen.
"I don't really get what's so great about this film. The film is like a collection of all the goofy stuff that Indians do. The film was edited pretty well - everything moves along briskly. Just when you start feeling like a scene is crap - they move on to the next one.The writing is pretty audacious. So even though a lot of ridiculous stuff happens on screen, they have made it all quite believable.KANGNA is pretty sensational in many of the scenes. And so are many of the supporting actors. The makers definitely hired a great casting director. For example, the actors who played KANGNA's friends in Amsterdam were pretty cool.It's not like Hindi cinema has improved much. It's still the same crap they used to churn out ages ago, but it is like more refined crap with a clear feminist bias."
"Most ridiculous movie i have ever seen. No theme of the movie just a wastage of time..... Who so ever had made this movie i am searching him since i have watched this movie to slap him. Its really a no sense theme movie, who have plenty of unnecessary time so they can watch this movie its a great deal for them. No any learning from the movie. Its really useless wasted money on making this movie. And who so ever has given the rating in the IMDb i also want to meet him that on what basis they have given this movie 8.8?I am not spoiling the content but i am writing the truth and actual thing what i have seen."
"Now This is one super awesome movie!!!!!!!!!!!! :D You don't need people, who don't need you!! You are good enough to go out and carve your own niche!! If there are lakhs of bad people, then there are thousands of great people!! This is what ""Queen"" is all about! Definitely the best movie of the year till now, Seriously how awesomely it makes you feel good! Yaar Dil khush kar diya!! :DAnd Definitely, not to leave out, that awesome cast! If you thought Srivedi was amazing in English Vinglish and you kinda connected, even though the story wasn't about Gen-Y, then you would just love Kangana as Queen!! I have my whole doubts of anyone doing a better justice to the movie than her! In every frame of the movie she felt real and you just see yourself in her, no matter how much confident you are!! Girls, its time to take over and fly! There are thousands of opportunities around! All you need to do is come out of that box, feel the fresh air and live life!! Go Girl power! :D"
"This is the 2nd time I am writing a review about any movie. the 1st one was Raanjhanaa. I am not into bollywood movies that much. but there are some movies of bollywood which really moves you. like ""Dil Chahta hai"".This movie has a brilliant storyline which will surely touch you. The direction has done perfectly well. And Kangna... what should I say?She has done the great justice to the movie. I guess no one could have played the role of naive and simple ""Rani"" better than her.The best part about this movie is that it will teach you lesson of life and its beauty. This movie has got everything. amazing story, emotions, laugh and voyage of self discovery and exploring life !!This movie is a must watch. worth every penny and every second."
"Queen is a happy film. The underdog wins... unlike the heartlessness of real life.The film is directed, shot and acted brilliantly. Vikas Bahl has done a great job. He now establishes himself as a director of a different cut. The film is incredibly detailed and nuanced. Some of the subtle humor may escape parts of the audience and therein lies its accomplishments. It tugs the hearts of a broad audience base at various levels. I tend to nitpick but this one is hard to find a flaw in.Most of all, it isn't over-dramatic. Nor does it stereotype (well, the hamming Jap maybe.) Neither is it predictably Bollywood.For a girl from a small town in North India, it takes a lot of chutzpah to get to where Kangana has. And she nails this fair and square. She is understated, spontaneous and one almost wants to reach out to her through the film.This one is going to be hard to beat in 2014. And its only March! Don't miss this gem."
"I went to watch this movie after reading rave reviews and have to admit that it quite lived up to my expectations, in fact surpassed them at times. Such a beautiful portrayal of a woman's emotion done in such an unadulterated way was so Indian and yet very global simultaneously. What I liked about Kangana's performance was that she looked totally original and truly herself, not inspired by any earlier performances by some other leading actresses like Kareena Kapoor. Given the fact that despite some moments in the movie looking like as having been enacted before in Indian Cinema, to maintain authenticity and originality without a trace of repetitiveness is a feat not very easy to pull off, other than by being totally connected to and having belief in your inner-self; something in which Kangana emerged triumphant.This is easily one of the milestone movies in Indian Cinema like JAB WE MET and must definitely get accolades to Kangana and the Director.Two Thumbs Up for this one !"
"Do you ever get that sinking feeling , as though you are being pulled down or the world is just collapsing before your eyes..and does that leave you feeling depressed and despondent? This is exactly the same trauma that Rani (Kangana Ranaut) ,a middle class Punjabi girl , experiences when her fiancé Vijay(Rajkumarr Rao) calls off their wedding at the last moment. You would think it to be a lamenting saga sympathizing with her but director Vikas Bahl adopts a refreshingly delirious approach and tells the adventures of the female protagonist who decides to travel on her honeymoon all alone , establishing an implicit ode to women empowerment.Rani is the quintessential conservative girl hailing from a small-town Mithaiwala family whose solo-travel(on honeymoon) marks her plunge to self-discovery. With a well-articulated narrative, resonating with the same sentiments that Shashi of English Vinglish carried , Queen brims with compassion and celebrates the joy of breaking free. It also reinforces the fact that - no man is foreign. The language barrier begins to fade when Rani befriends a Parisian waitress, shares flat with inmates who happens to be boys ,but she remains in the confines of her traditions and yet defies the norms set by others. You rejoice when she triumphs over a mugger, lets her hair down to Bollywood remix at a pub, gets drunk ,does some nut-crazy talks with strangers and inadvertently buys souvenirs from a sex shop. Bahl's deft direction with splendid cinematography handles these aspects pretty well. Amit Trivedi's soulful music brings in an added advantage but the dialogues(additionally penned by Kangana herself!) replete with humor, are bang-on!The plot however gets meandering and over-indulgent at times, Rani's first kiss and the golgappa becoming a rage in the Dutch boulevard appear fabricated but those are minor passable glitches .The beauty lies in the authenticity of the characters and Bahl brings out the flavor of the NRI influences in a refreshing way. Specially in one of those conversations where Rani goes to her meet her NRI aunt's family and they pretend to express grief over her getting jilted at her wedding.The film benefits from the bravura performance by Kangana who carries the film on her shoulders with aplomb. Her Rani doesn't shy from the problems, she chooses to embrace them and tries to find a solution. Sweet and diligent, yet strong willed and individualistic, Queen stands as the epitome of a liberated and independent Indian woman.Rajkumar Rao is brilliant as her egotist fiancé and his portrayal of an archetypal MCP is terrific. Lisa Hayden is a complete revelation playing the unapologetic Vijaylaksmi.The depiction of the refusal to feign hypocritical coyness while encountering the physical relationships is no mean feat and she does it with gusto.Queen is a gem and one must watch it for Kangana's heartfelt act.Right from its start till the ending credits rolling and paying tribute to Facebook,its a winner all the way. I strongly recommend that you go for it."
Very good acting and refreshing movie. Definitely must watch
"Today is International Men's Day, and this is a feel good film that extols the virtues of people just being 'normal' with each other irrespective of race, gender or any other diversities!The mention of the International Men's Day is in response to someone opening the review with International Woman's Day!?!!Well made movie! Still smiling!"
"Good shift from general mainstream Bollywood. It's a feel good movie with a non-definitive story-line. You'll definitely feel rejuvenated and might end up with some good vibes. It signifies how traveling can change a person and her perceptions.Initial scenes of the movie are kind of overdone. The protagonist acts like she's new to human civilization - afraid of crossing roads, running from people on the streets. It might make you cringe a little.Cities like Paris and Amsterdam has been portrayed in a stereotypical manner.Some might find the end-credits sequence interesting - gives a short visual of the protagonist's journey."
"This is the second time in all my years of watching movies in the cinema, where during the climatic scene the whole theatre would erupt in spontaneous cheers, whistles and claps (the first time it happened was Speed). It's never an easy task to be able to manage a feat like that. If it happens it is because the movie has gotten under everyone's skin and the audience want to celebrate the end of the hero's journey. In Queen's case it is a heroine which is an absolute marvel in Bollywood. It is not often that an ordinary female figure is the central character. The story premise is not new. I have seen stories like this in every language. Rani (Kangana Ranaut) is due to marry Vijay (Rajkummar Rao), but 2 days before the wedding Vijay wants out. His reason - he has changed and marriage is an impediment to his life pursuit. His real reason I think is that he finds Rani is not good enough for him. Rani is devastated. Who wouldn't? She sulks and finally decides to go on the Honeymoon trip to Paris and Amsterdam on her own. The stuff that happen on the trip and the people she meets will change her life forever. This is a common story but what is done in Queen totally surprised me. My wife tells me that one of things she found so refreshing is that there is no new love angle. Most of these type of films love to rush out of the blocks to make the girl fall in love with a new worthier man. This movie also doesn't have any wise person to give sagely advice to her. In short it feels like a breath of fresh air. The script is really smart and maintains a light-hearted tone throughout. Everybody already knows breaking up is terrible, especially when it's at the marriage altar. No need to manipulate us to weep again and again. Instead the script make us laugh and laugh. But it's laughter tinged with poignancy. I also love the seamless editing. It moves back and forth in its timeline but not once am I confused. In fact, it makes perfect sense for the flashbacks because it is Rani's way of remembering the past and then to exorcise it out of her. Stories like this get condescending very fast but I didn't feel that low blow at all. Anybody who knows movies knows casting is 99%. The success of this film owes a huge proportion to the acting talents of Kangana Ranaut. I don't think I have seen her before and she absolutely nails her role to perfection. Right from the start when her character has not even been fleshed out, my heart already felt like bursting when Vijay says he doesn't want to marry her. Watch and marvel at a great actress. So nuanced, so pitiful, so spot-on. The whole film rested on her shoulders and she carried the movie to the finishing line and beyond. Why beyond? Because the movie is not just entertaining, it is also an important film with something to say about the plight of young women in India. The movie suggests that woman is looked upon as objects rather than life partners in a marriage. Where the finger is pointed at is a the mindset of people. So in a sense Queen is giving an ""up yours"" to all the men and also for women to start figuring out who they are, what they want and what they are worth. The message definitely went through because the audience cheered when Rani sticks it up to Vijay at the end. Watch this movie get nominated for some big awards this year."
"Rani (kangna) hails from a middle class Punjabi family in Delhi and when she is spotted by Vijay (rajkumar) who hails from London, it is love at first sight. He wooes her to the fullest and finally Rani agrees and marriage is set. But just at the eleventh hour, Vijay comes from London only to call it off. Everyone is shattered including Rani but she decides to have her honeymoon at Paris and Amsterdam, on her own. What happens from there forms the rest.The director has come up with an interesting storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was amazing. The dialogues were well written. The script was different and the screenplay made it gel perfectly one screen.The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the characters while the art department was natural. Kangna Ranaut carried the film very responsibly and she delivered her best. Lisa Haydon was not just smoking hot but also confident in her act. Rajkumar Rao was impressive, he scored well. Mish Boyko was worth mentioning, Jeffrey was entertaining, Guitobh Joseph was good.Coming up with rom-coms is one thing but including them with some offbeat concepts is something else. It can be seen in this one and at the same time, the makers are tapping the women audience with such subjects. The first half goes on a lighter mode with elements of entertainment, some romance. The interval bang was promising and the second half has its own share of fun and emotional highs. Overall, this is a film which appeals due to the class audience.The films performances are rich, the direction amazing, and when it comes to women centric films, Queen is pathbreaking creating a new genre in Hindi films. A must watch!!!"
"Awesome, Stupendous, Superb Act and Out of Box concept.!!! For me its 10/10.Kangna Ranaut did an unexpected performance. She has single handed taken the movie to her shoulders and taken it up to the level where it can't be beaten. Furthermore, the act was flawless and seems all genuine in every part of the movie.Supported casts too did a great job from typical Punjabi's's style to international friends.The FB time-line in the end takes it to a superb ending.I am going to watch this movie again."
"A delight to watch film. Kangana is so genuine in this movie that you don't even think for a moment that she is not a well established actress in Bollywood. Very well narrated and evenly executed. Talking about music than i assure you, Songs will surely make your body dancing on the beats, and there are soothing and slow numbers too. Every one on the screen gets enough attention from the director and these small small things makes a big movie. Scenes from lajpat nagar of Delhi to Paris and then Amsterdam are very well shown in the film. Vikas Bahl, Well played. :) Overall a must watch film. A good film to freshen up your weekend.. :)"
"A heart winning tale of a simple and innocent girl from Delhi, which stays with you even after leaving the auditorium.A perfect movie at Woman's day.Kangna really shines like a QUEEN. Special kudos to the director for such a fine work,with a cast comprising foreign actors also. Never expected such fineness from a Bollywood flick. Every frame is beautiful,special mention to cinematographer Bobby Singh... RIP sir. Rani's Dadi ,brother,best friend all were excellent. Lisa Haydon is super sexy in each frame an absolute performer. And also Rajkumar Rao another great performer, once again proved his mettle although he is the one we tend to hate most for leaving Rani :)Go watch it and feel good."
"Yes I didn't enjoy the movie because the expectations were too high , the reason I went to see it was because it was averaged 9\10 on IMDb, no I didn't believe the character, the concept it self is worthy but I was constantly waiting for the movie to start something edgy to watch, I got bored on the forceful overacting of some characters , the movie was nasty, the uncle and little boys reactions were inappropriate, I don't know why Indian people are praising the movie when most of it was stupid and nasty, why? Is this the new taste, if it is its not worth it, events in the movie weren't big enough to engage, the fact that rajkumar rao had a small role was a plus because now we can say not only katrina kaif gets to be the small fit, the message of representing black, Russian and Japanese people was good and how ud rather be with them than a bad Indian which people in India wouldn't know because they haven't interacted with overall it was a failed attempt to represent the aspects approriately abit more needed in middle story though covered Indian people in foreign life rawly as some things haven't been brang out that it did with dialogues, needs a higher standard due to high entertainment from utube vids"
"There is a reason it bagged 10/10 from my vote.This has turned out to be a superb movie. India needs more movies like this - A female oriented script! 1) The characterization is too strong. Kanagana plays an outstanding role of a typical desi girl. She has expressed herself very well in variety of situations thru out the movie. SHE HAS CARRIED THE MOVIE WELL! her speech, dialogue delivery , make-up etc is so well designed.2) A very simple & new but a strong and well directed script!! Everyone can relate to it. not to complex and very entertaining.3) Overall, direction of the movie with Paris/ Amsterdam is great.4) Other global characters have done a brilliant job and have justified it well 5) It has depicted well how one can come out of one's own clichés!"
"Queen is surprisingly great. it has surpassed all expectations and is one of the finest movie to come out this decade. not only that if you compare it with other great work of bollywood in recent times it will stand above all.... The plot of the movie is simple,but the mind blowing performances and treatment of subject has made this a great movie.the first half is bit slow but actress performance has made it run smooth. you will be entertained,cherished,satisfied at the end of the movie,and surely will fall in love with the Kangana's character....totally a feel good movie.... the is a must watch for everyone. don't miss it.."
"Going in, I had read/heard mixed reviews. A few suggested that this one was a rip-off of 'English Vinglish' (more on that later). A few, said that the only 2 things worth watching were Kangana Ranaut's performance and the final 20 minutes. I did not know of Vikas Bahl (the helmer, who previously worked on the not-quite-here-or-there 'Chillar Party').I had seen/enjoyed 'English/Vinglish', and the one thing this one has in common with that is the music composer, Amit Trivedi (who's yet to surpass his own 'Dev D', but is probably belting out some of the best stuff that's out there these days).Kangana Ranaut: This is one actress at whom the entire audience was laughing at, when she tried 'acting' drunk in her first movie, 'Gangster', which was a hit because of its narration and great soundtrack, no credit to her, IMO. However, I did watch other movies she performed in, including 'Life in a metro' and 'Tanu weds Manu', and she was fantastic in both of them (also helped that both movies were very good, and the former also reflect director Anurag Basu's growth in terms of choosing subjects, though he did rip off the Jack Lemmon vehicle, 'Apartment' for the segment with Ranaut/Kohli/Menon - unkind words were said about her character in the movie mimicking her experiences in real-life at that time).She really owns it in this one, and it was kinda sad to note the material not really pushing it to the max, and staying safe, considering (I think) she was in a place so perfect that her performance would have benefited from some envelope-pushing. Having said that though, this Phantom production (Kashyap, et al, just coming off of the success of 'Hasee toh phasee') pushes all the (just) right buttons, and manages to educate and entertain at the same time. Wrong release timing though, since womens' day was a couple weeks earlier.This sure tries to be quite a few things at the same time: Rebelling against the typical conservative response to rejection is one theme, along with turning into a mismatched buddy-comedy where one learns from the other (along with some welcome same sex erotic overtones in a few sequences, though they're ultimately played for laughs), a competitive cook-off, Hostel 3 (just kidding, but I had to put this out there as well - you'll know when you watch it). Given that it tries to accomplish so many things at the same time in the same flick, I was as (pleasantly) surprised as I was watching 'English/Vinglish' when that also tried to become something more, while ultimately chickening out, just this way this one does as well. Too much to ask, I suppose.Lisa Haydon, an Angelina-done-right in terms of looks, has some amazing screen presence, but her acting definitely needs to shine better (she does have the looks to pull anything off, and her performance here is much better than a lot of good-looking wooden blocks that populate Bollywood). The supporting characters lend some able support, merging into the background when needed, and Kangana shines all through, as was the objective since the beginning.Though it sure has some sequences that left me scratching my head, more so from the censoring perspective - Lisa's bra is blurred in this theatrical cut, but the scene in the sex toy store is intact, as are few cleavage shots. Very confusing, and inconsistent, though their inconsistency's sure consistent.Definitely worth a watch, esp. on the big screen, though I wish it had been done much better."
"Queen follows the story of the Delhi girl Rani from Rajouri area, and probably one of the best things about the movie was the portrayal of the people living there. The people were very relatable in the sense that we all have that one relative/friend who behaves in the given manner. Even the simple Roohafza bottle at the dinner table scene made me feel so at home I felt I could smell the food.The soundtrack was excellent, and the songs are relevant to the moment, and do not include any unnecessary mass synchronized choreographed dances.While the script has a couple of small weak moments, the good moments are so good that we can gleefully ignore the few problems. The growth of Rani in the movie feels organic while she goes on a journey of self actualization. Kudos to the director/writer Vikas Bahl for not falling in the cliché trap by *spoiler alert* keeping Rani single and happy at the end of the movie, instead of showing that her happiness would have depended on her marrying the 'right' guy! *spoiler alert ends*The Indianisms in the movie were handled in good taste with light hearted fun at the expense of the Indian Rishtedaari (family) system. Small things like Rani's email address ""happyrani@yahoo.com"", or the not so French, Indian French Toast won me over.Overall, I believe that Rani is a must watch for everyone, and especially to the Delhiwallas, you are going to have a lot of fun! :D"
"I must say kangana is awesome in this movie. Her acting is very natural. yet this movie resembles Movie ""English Vinglish"" but the story is truly different. If you are watching this movie you never loose a smile at your face through whole movie. Song: The song is very good enough to make it your collection Specially ""london Thumka"" and ""Gujariya""cast: Casting is very simple but they are able to win your heart. lisa haydon played very well for supporting actress. Story: Bahl specially tributes this movie on Women's day. In this he shows how to carry with those situation when everything is odd. I must say this movie is enough to commit this line. ""if you fell stand up! Remove your dust and carry on because this is not the end of the world"". Story tripped for a while but through this is negligible. A girl whose fiancé ditched her so she make her mind to tour her honeymoon all alone. She never been in abroad so she find it very difficult to survive but with the help and courage of hers she made it. Bahl Concluded this movie very brilliantly. Flaws: i searched it through the movie but not able to find any. 10 on 10 I highly recommend to watch this movie."
"Story: Whenever a bollywood story has been written differently,that is when a female protagonist can hope for a scope of showing her acting skills. Queen is a movie which starts with a familiar note of a Punjabi style Delhi wedding .Suddenly the focus shifts on to another familiar happening -- A selfish boy Vijay ditching his long time girlfriend Rani just 2 days before marriage because he has realized that he has changed so much owing to his new job and lifestyle but the love of his life has not changed at all.She is still the same innocent , simple middle class girl whom he admired earlier. The transition from happy wedding ceremonies to a maatam (funeral) type situation is captured beautifully specially when the family is trying to explain to the eunuchs in front of a heartbroken Rani that the wedding was there but it is no more happening.The story catches your attention in very first 10 minutes and you start hating the bad boy Vijay so much so that you can just watch this movie till end to make sure that Rani does not get into his trap again. The character then moves to a new landscape altogether which is quite refreshing because we are fed up of snobby stories where a breakup is the end of life.Most importantly, director's vision is very clear as he efficiently portrays how Rani does not forget her past but at the same time, being a real-life plain hearted simple girl, she does not overdo the crying part. Kudos to the writer, who make sure that every character and every plot in the story has a new feel to it.The story moves to Paris and Amsterdam where Rani meets strangers who soon become part of her life. Like the Vijaylaxmi who accidentally enters Rani's life and eventually replaces Vijay in Rani's life. Although , there is not much story happening in Paris, Amsterdam part, but thanks to amazing screenplay, you never feel like ""Oh i know the plot"". Initially, Rani's foreigner friends look watchable but you feel more connected to their characters as their story unfolds. The end is not a high octane drama but suits well.Thanks to Rajkumar's superb acting, viewers like me kept praying that Rani does not fall into his sorry act and moves on in her life.Screenplay: After watching first 10 minutes of the movie, one feels involved in the story. Characters and their screenplay is handled beautifully in Delhi style . Every scene takes you closer to the lead character.Typicla north Indian scenes like eunuchs coming for blessing the couple and taking their share of goodies , have been added quite interestingly and add value to the story.Story in Paris seems just a bit dragged sometimes but overall all characters in foreign lands have been handled beautifully such that you start liking them as much as the innocent Rani.Last scene where Rani thanks her culprit Boyfriend for introducing her to this new fresh .life, summarizes the story creatively.Another scene which is very creative is the one where Rani tries to hide away from Eiffel Tower but cannot find any space where she would not be reminded of her long cherished dream of having dinner with her would be husband on the Eiffel Tower. Acting: Kangana Ranaut: The film belongs to Kangana and she proves her metal as an actress. Seems like she has used her theater skills to get into the skin of a Delhi middle class girl extremely well.Kangan perfectly expresses the vision of the director while depicting the innocence,simplicity and occasional craziness of Rani's character.Occasional murmuring sounds and voice modulation while talking to foreigners(intentional) lend more authenticity to her character.Rajkumar has done extremely good acting of an irritating ex-fiancé who thinks that he should be the only man in to Rani's life even after ditching her just before marriage.Rani's mother , father have done their role with an ease and maturity.The character of Rani's brother has been done beautifully as he shows the right expression as any Dilli wala brother would show to a guy who ditched his beloved sister. Lisa Hayden has done full justice to her carefree, westernized character. Mish Boyko as Alexander is cute and Marco as the restaurant owner is good. Music: Music of the film is good. Songs are few but catchy and flow well with the story. Starting song 'London thumakda' is a Punjabi flavored song and makes a good presence.Other songs are also good but you are so glued to the characters that you may not remember them. Background music is the end is good."
"QUEEN is about a shy and timid girl who travels to Paris and Amsterdam for her honeymoon all alone, when her beau calls off the wedding at the last minute. A quirky concept, yes. But this coming of age story is indeed enjoyable, despite the hiccups. On the whole, QUEEN reinvents the genre with its non-formulaic screenplay and skilled direction. A charming little film, this one's made with heart and feeling and it shows. Absolutely recommended! Ultimately, it's Kangana Ranaut who makes you root for Rani from the word go. The best way to describe her fabulous performance is by confessing that I forgot I was watching Kangana. It's a raw, nuanced, delicately comical performance, and Bahl rightfully builds his film around his fearless, quirky heroine.I'm going with full ten stars for Queen. It's an extraordinary journey with a Rani who will stay in your heart."
"First of all QUEEN is not an intense feminist movie. Neither it only focuses on Women. It comes with a simple message that people should live their life to fullest and be open for any new experiences. It is a sweet, light, heart throbbing kind of a tale about a girl who never lived her life as per her own wishes. But when she got an opportunity to do this on a foreign land, she discovered a new cheerful, confident girl in herself, beneath the obedient one. Vikas Behl and his team has done a superb job. Perfect casting (many undiscovered faces for Bollywood), tight screenplay, picturesque European locations and usage of their culture in story line ;and heart throbbing punjabi music. Kangana has delivered a superbly palpable performance. But, thing about movie is that it never gets serious (a very common pitfall in which such movies falls). You do feel the sadness of Queen but it never impregnates you. Rather, it is her happy, excited, dancing and exploring something new moments that you will feel like being a part of. So, by the end of movie there are good chances that you are thinking of going on such a trip, while humming one of the Bollywood numbers in the movie. Movie has very aptly tried to question beleagurement of women in Indian society and judgmental attitude towards them (particularly scene when an Indian Pole dancer speaks perfect Urdu), but rather being sad, these moments are pleasant. Definitely, Kangana is going to be nominated for best actress role and numerous supporting actor's nominations."
"The woman's day movie which has garnered much acclaim amongst bollywood heavyweights and audience alike is bound to keep you in splits throughout, whether it be the soliloquy at the start, the family meets over skype, the scenes in the Amsterdam hostel with foreigners sharing the room or the run-in with western ways of our young, newly dumped Indian heroine. Kangna delivers a class act in this class film of female liberation. Faced with the prospect of a wedding called off, preparations down the drain, her vow of chastity lengthened, our heroine starts off on her own to her honeymoon in Paris and Amsterdam. On the way she overcomes her fear of stepping out on her own, without the constant company of her younger brother, staying in hotels with strangers, drinking and dancing uninhibited before people. In a scene with Vijaylakshmi, her new-found waitress friend, on her way to the hotel in a cab, she says women are not even allowed to burp properly in India. That to me was the essence of the character, set out to liberate herself from the handcuffs of tradition in the patriarchal society we live in. When she returns from the trip, transformed into a woman fully capable of making her own decisions and life choices, you feel she has truly become the Queen she always deserved to be. The end is both poignant and revealing of her triumph against her inner conflicts as she realises that perhaps the break-up was the best thing to have happened to her, as her grandmother had stated towards the beginning of the movie, and she eschews the return to old ways brought about by sobriety and the pressure to lead a normal, boring life of a housewife as her expectant 'chai-shai' drinking in-laws want. The music is lovely and catchy, esp the Hungama song which can hold its own in any disc in the world."
