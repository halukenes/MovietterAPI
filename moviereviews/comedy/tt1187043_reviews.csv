Reviews
"It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film."
"I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been ""The Legend of Rancho"".Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak ""Spanglish"" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!"
"As many ordinary Chinese high school students,who have to study fourteen(14) hours every day for the college entrance examination in the final year,I was entirely shaken and moved by ""3 idiots"",sharing the same feeling with all the students from high schools and universities in China(or Asia). O(∩_∩)O Compared with mainland China,India is lucky,having less corruption in education system.This film is incredible inspiring,especially for those who are struggling or ""survived"" in high schools and colleges.I read some reviewer,some doubt whether suicide in the film is logical,which is really DISAPPOINTING! (—__—!)If you experience the life in poverty areas in Asia,you will understand what a significant role the higher educations play in their lives. Burdening great pressure from family and society,they attach great expectation and significance to the enrollment of colleges,and they intend to abandon poverty by getting higher education.Diploma means everything for them. Thus,the plot where the man committed suicide after lost the chance to graduate is reasonable."
"""Whatever the problem in life is... just say to yourself 'Aal Izz Well'.. This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it.."" ""Chase Excellence and success will follow"".. "" Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams"".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn't get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest film to date.. The film's climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...My Rating: 9/10Thanks and Regards"
"Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film.
Its about the pursuit of happiness. 
What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show. This guy is the best thing to happen to Bollywood. The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood."
"I'm an IITian myself and hence, needless to say, was looking forward to this movie as it is based on the life in IITs. I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.As you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, it's all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before it's too late.Take my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Don't let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. You'll bless me for this advice !"
"This is the very first time i write a review, mostly because I'm very lazy.However I just watched this film and i gotta admit it...I loved it!!!!At first i was like well ""lets see what this movie has to offer""(btw its also the first Indian movie I've ever seen) and I was like okayits funny and then... like wow so thoughtful and reflexive! It reallymade me meditate about my career and my real dreams! Its a very goodmovie! I'll recommend it to all my friends!You must watch it!All is Well!"
"I was lucky to see the first day show of 3 idiots on Thursday in Dubai. Well the title of this post says it all. The movie is an example of classic film making. brilliant and highly entertaining.Watch 3 idiots for a) amir khan's incredible acting b) intelligent and highly energatic screenplay & direction (Rajkumar Hirani has done it yet again!) c) amazing chemistry among actors, d) some of the best comedy scenes coming from Indian cinema in a long time and e) a heart warming story which keeps you spell binded right till the end.I would rate it as among the best from amir khan (which obviously means among the very best from bollywood. I would also give a lot of credit to the director rajkumar hirani, who after this movie (and his previous munna bhai series) should rank as among the top in bollywood too. 9/10."
"Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to ""Five Point Someone"", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that ""chase excellence and success will follow"".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...Verdict : THE BEST of 2009 !

"""All is well,"" the three ""idiot"" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.But all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas ""Rancho"" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.One of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call ""Virus"" when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.If anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of ""living through a person"" that I can imagine.The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen."
"I'm from the Philippines. For years, I have always been curious about Indian cinema. I've seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just don't get it. I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. When a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing ""All iz well.."" I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it."
"I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post."
"Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. Aamir pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching aamir .It was rancho on screen. sharman n madhavan - i bow down to them. music looks OK on cd but during movie it worked as a plus point. situational tracks works in the favour of film. runtime may sound a bit too much but believe me, you wont know when the first half is over. second half may seem a bit too hilarious but apart from that its a masterpiece. gr8 aamir ,another brilliant movie.10/10"
"We saw a sneak preview of 3 Idiots last night at Globus Cinema in Bandra, Mumbai.Brilliant. Simply, brilliant.Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.Sharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.Sharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!Madhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. He's that Good.Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.Cliché word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 P.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'"
"To be brief, THIS IS THE BEST Indian MOVIE EVER CREATED..... I know it is old but I just heard about it recently so I watched it yesterday. I think this movie should be one of the best 250 films in history on IMDb rating. I rated it 10/10 and believe me it worth more than this. I don't want to make spoilers in my review so that you will enjoy every minute of the movie. This movie is 2:44 hours length full of laughter, joy, tears, drama and passion. And of course, the most interesting part of the movie is GENIALITY. I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. I'm also waiting for Ferrari Ki sawari movie to watch. It is starred by one of the 3 idiots. Thank you India for giving us this brilliant movie."
"Yesterday i watched 3 I.D.I.O.TS(I Do it On My terms)the most entertaining and simply the best movie of this decade after RDB. a movie with a message(chase excellence success will follow)without loosing its sense of humor,a movie about friendship and love,a movie about flawed education system, a movie about unhealthy competition.this movie is team work ,every one does its part very well. Aamir (what a actor he is!!!)is excellent as Rancho ,Madhavan and Sharman are perfectly in sync(watch both of them in drunk scene), Kareena is OK,Boman played director's character as good as it was possible,Omi was top notch (watch Chamatkar \Balatkar scene),But whenever the team wins credit goes to captain,and here the captain is Rajkumar hirani.He gave 'Jaadu Ki Jhappi 'in MB,'Gandhigiri' in LRMB and now he says 'ALL IZZ WELL' and believe me he is 100% right.Dialogues: Witty with humor and to the point, Chamatkar \Balatkar scene is one of the best comic scenes . Music: Shantanu Moitra's music also have a role in the movie,all the songs come alive on the screen,(watch Zoobie-Doobie and Aal Izz Well)FINAL WORDS: its like a marriage between RDB and Lage Raho Munnabhai. no doubt there is some MASALA but we indians like it . Rating: FIVE POINT SOMETHING OUT OF FIVE.Don't BE A STUPID BE AN I.D.I.O.T. ! must watch."
"This is the first Bollywood movie I have seen. (I don't know if ""Slum dog millionaire"" is also an Indian movie or not.) I have learned from my parents long ago that Indian movies are excellent and full of dance scenes. They watched quite a few Indian movies when they were youngsters.Then I had my first experience of watching a Bollywood movie quiet by accident. It was during the sports meet held by the school in which I teach English. I was appointed to do some work using the computer, which we would run some movies when we were free. And the first movie was ""3 Idiots."" I don't know who picked the movie. To be honest, I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title, which, translated back into English, is ""3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood"". I expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. It's a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points, shed tears at other points and think all the time.It's about friendship, dream, love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China, I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study, which causes a lot of students' losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times, including those times I watched it in my class with my students.I give it a ten."
"As you can see, I'm a huge movie buff. However, my scope is strictly limited to English-speaking movies. In other words, I have scruples watching foreign movies in subtitles. Nevertheless, I'm completely in the state of idleness for the whole summer. What's even worse, I've run out of American movies to watch since I've basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a Jim-Carrey-parody-like comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious. On account of my preference for serious movies, I tend to ignore those ""silly"" comedies. However, my friend's non-stop imploring drove me nuts. To humor him, I decided to give the movie a try.The beginning was kinda within my expectation. Two goofy ""idiots"" started to turn the world around them upside down by extremely over-the- top actions(stopping a flight, hitchhiking a limousine), they reached an observatory of The Imperial College of Engineering, aka ICE, their alma mater, to meet a friend they've lost contact for six years. Only to find another classmate, Chatur, who started to boast himself for his success over some guy named Rancho. Until then, I was feeling this movie was no different than any other comedies. However, the following sequences kicked in and I was completely blown away. It all started with a magnificent melody that unveiled the main storyline.The main character, Rancho, was a guy who was enrolled in ICE. However, he was totally different than any other students. Instead of studying by rote like any other students, he focused more on the practical aspect of the knowledge. As a result, he was able to shock a bully in the groin with electricity. There was another student like him, who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director, Virus(a nickname of course) wouldn't allow him to graduate. The heartbreaking rejection ultimately led to the student's suicide. Rancho realized the education system in India was extremely flawed. It suppressed the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho decided to step up against it. He kept challenging his teachers and even the director. He made 2 good friends, Farhan and Raju(the two goofy idiots in the beginning) and really inspired them. Later, he met a girl named Pia, who turned out to be the director's daughter. A lot of clashes occurred in Rancho's intent to change the education system and even his friendship was put to test. The ending of the movie was so touching that anybody would shed tears from their eyes, with a small twist that would made everything pleasant once again.Overall, it's really a sweet movie. It can be a comedy at times, with a lot of over-the-top action from Rancho and his friends. However, it's a lot more than that. It's more of an insight into the education system of India, which is similar to those in the likes of other Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea. It can at times be so heart- warming that your tears can't help but surge out like waterfalls. It can be a musical too, with a lot of exotic dances and songs which are common among Indian movies. Great film. Totally change my impression for Indian movies. Easily 10/10."
"I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success – that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking."" ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."" Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it."
"Rajkumar Hirani... the name is enough to create an excitement in any cinema-fan alive. Munnabhai series have been awesome films, and his latest offering '3 Idiots' is another Masterstroke from this genius.I have no idea how 5-point-someone is, all I know is that '3 Idiots' is an amazing/awesome/inspiring film. A treat of a film! A film that is rich in emotions, A Film that leaves behind a great moral. The Youth are sure to worship this Film, and that will make this film a blockbuster. Cancel anything you're planning to do till the 31st, watch '3 Idiots', it's worth your time and money. Hirani and Joshi's script is simply superb. Through Humor how many rights and wrongs are said. I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharman's family. A typical 1950's family, it's hilarious as well as genius. The film has Superb Performances: Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. He leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards Aamir The Pen. Mona is average.The Music is decent, with 'All Izz Well' being a complete chart-buster. The cinematography is perfect. All other departments are satisfactory.Watch this film right now..."
"When I was looking through IMDb's Top 250 movie list and saw a movie called ""3 Idiots"", I was surprised. Why would a movie with such a bad title be voted so highly? I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!"
"Well, at least it is in Asian's Mind. It's SO GODDAMN GOOD for Asians.You don't get the high school thing so you think it's overrated. Well, Dark Knight and The Avengers are overrated for us because we don't get the superheroes thing. But so what? Still, a lot of people love it, so Stop Taking Your Personal feelings as The Lethal Truth. To make you understand better. Let me tell you something about the high school thing. If you have studied in Chinese or Indian High school you will understand what's all about the suicide and sad plot. Life was like a pis of sh!t. You have to wake up at 6:30 and go to bed after like 10:30, you can never choose your class, you can never say anything that against the teacher, you can never be in relationship with boys or girls. Right here, NO PARTY, NO PROM, NO NOTHING. All you have to do and all you can do is study and study, and the only way to make your life better is to get good grades. Because of the hard works and lack of fun, you're totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that you're lazy. And what's even funnier, is that 80% of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.That's why we love the film, it showed our mind, it's not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry. This movie is 9.1 in douban.com(A Really Famous Website in China)It's 8 out of 10 for us, and even for some of you. For some of you, it's 6 or 7 out of 10. So, it's 8.1 for average. NOTHING IS WRONG. So, please, try to understand."
"If i could give this movie higher then a 10. I would. I think anyone gives this movie a low marking, should not be allowed to judge movies, maybe even keep them out of the theaters!!! This movie is funny, charming, loving, did i mention funny? Will make u tear from laughing as well as in other moments. One second you'll be laughing, and the next second you'll feel their pains. Lots of ups and downs. awesome movie........must watch for everyone.Amir khan has always been great. Old classic movies to all the new ones. He has broadened his horizon. Amazing actor who plays serious parts as well as goofy roles. He kind of reminded me of Johnny Depp. Man is brilliant. The Dean of the school was also hilarious. I know that had to be a hard role to play, but wow did he pull it off.Again, must watch for young, old, teens. If you have been through college, it will definitely hit the spot a little more.. Enjoy!"
"I absolutely LOVED this movie. I was one of two or three 'white' people in the Cinema, and waiting in the line i got a lot of 'looks', but I'm speechless to how good this movie was!!! Aamir just keeps getting better!!!! TZP was amazing, Ghajani was amazing and now 3 Idiots... AMAZING!!! cant wait to own it on DVD!!! I might even go see it again at the cinema!! I've now seen about 5 Bollywood movies at the cinema, and i own about 30 movies on DVD. I'm an Aussie what LOVES Bollywood & Aamir Khan!!! What movies is next for Aamir? I'm sure it will be another to touch our hearts, i'd love to see his body ripped like in Ghajani again! 3 IDIOTS ROCKS!!!"
"This movie hit on all cylinders. It was fun, funny, deep, intelligent, thought provoking, and seriously entertaining. It is not a dumb comedy, rather a very smart (and humorous) look at the struggles of engineering students in India.I thought I would have trouble with the subtitles, but after about 10- minutes I was completely 100% engrossed in the movie. The wife loved every bit of it.My single and only criticism is the length of the movie. I believe there were one or two too many situations which kind of caused the movie to drag.Otherwise I thoroughly loved it.Do not be fooled by the idiotic picture on the cover of this movie. And the first 5-minutes of the movie are not indicative of the brilliance of the rest of the film. It is not stupid humor (even though I like stupid humor).You will leave this movie being glad you watched it. Trust me."
"I am writing this very late, even though I saw the movie on the first dayit took a second fast-forward viewing on my laptop to compel me to opine on this film. And since brushing through the comments, I found a lot of good stuff written about it, I'd like to skip over the brownie points the film certainly deserves and focus on what I found sodisappointing.1) sigh, the jokeswhat to say, I actually felt embarrassed listening to them and hear people guffaw on stuff that evoked chuckles in the 70s. 2) over the top scenes which were just not required- Rancho taking a bath in the garden(!) in front of everyone? In most good institutes even walking on the grass is frowned uponn here this chap doesn't mind spoiling the soil with his soapy water. (This is what annoys me about characters portrayed as non-conformists. They confuse it with plain indecency and ludicrousness, like when Patch Adams bared his bottom after getting his degree); n driving the scooter into the hospital itselfwhy couldn't he just stop at the doorway n make it a genuinely good shot??? 3) The timeline was all wrong; did no one do math at primary school? Farhan says they hadn't seen rancho for 5 yrsramalingam returns after 10 yrs to keep the betno one saw rancho after college finishedengineering is 4 yrsthe bet could not have been made before the second semester as they already have had at least one semester exams!!! Simple math will tell you its all goofed up. Kareena kapoor was engaged when these guys were in 1st-2nd yearso she waited 8 years to get married??? If that banker guy was so considerate and patient, he is the real hero 4) Anybody who has lived in hostel with room mates will tell you that in 4 yrs together, you get to know every minute detail about you buddies; these guys didn't even know rancho's hometown! 5) And these supposedly bright engineers and the doctor Kareena don't have even enough brains to look up the college records to find Rancho's address? They could have at least asked Boman Irani, who would have certainly known it considering he knew Chachad's monthly income! 6) Even with that lame, copied joke 'Do you know who I am', they are just ridiculing their own film; is it so difficult for a professor to find three students of a class whose faces he has seen from the college records? A cheeky antic like that would have meant instant suspension in a real IIT. 7) Hirani's idea of ragging is based on the fairy tales boys brag to wide-eyed fifth-graders; you just cant survive in a hostel if you electrocute a senior's winkie on you first day. I'd have loved it had they shown Rancho getting a beating from seniors in return for his actionsit would have truly highlighted the ragging problem. Instead they showed the whole bunch of seniors running scared on seeing a baby-faced fresher with a live wire. 8) And oh, they took the peeing joke too far, too many timesits disgusting. Ramalingam, a VP of some MNC peeing on a school building? Come on 9) I understand that the ridiculous arrangement barred Rancho from keeping in touch with any student from ICSbut what about Kareena? Was his love so shallow he didn't give a damn about her just to honor some crazy vow which didn't even involve her? How are they showing Indian women? She has no self-respect? She runs away from her wedding, betraying a guy who waited 10 years for her to a guy who left her in a heartbeat? And is it unnatural or materialistic to scream if someone spoils your 2 lac wedding dress or loses a 3 lac watch??? Again the problem with execution of an idea; there were a thousand better ways to expose that guy's shallownessbut all what rancho and his pals did was irritate him by damaging his property. 10) And the law breaking, which when done with timing looks good was just taken too fargetting an international flight stopped, fooling a taxi driver who'd probably lose his job, leaking university paper- they are criminal offenses-why do you need to portray new age thinking with a disdain for the law? 11) And finally even if we forget the fact that any decent college has a medical attendant, a health centre and generators always present to accord a movie a spicy climax, hirani spoilt it with the all-is-well cliché. Cant just one thing be normal?"
"I checked this out on a whim from my library and was so impressed that I just had to come here to review it. Please note I am NOT Indian, but this is (as of yesterday) one of my top five favorite films of all time. My only criticism is the title - it's horribly misleading for American audiences who would probably expect a Judd Apatow nonsense film (and offensive to boot). Not so with this film - the characters are anything but idiots despite their college experiences. Brilliantly written and directed, there's something for everyone here: comedy, tragedy, and even a couple of song and dance numbers (seamlessly integrated). The acting is superb, the plot is a bit complex but fascinating, and it's shot with care and attention. LOVE IT."
"Perfect. Almost. Oh yeah... those are the words! I'm writing this at the 8th hour of the morning of 25th December. Merry Christmas, viewers, this is the perfect treat. I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the year's best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his 'perfectionist' attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when you're supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences aren't boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...But, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hirani's brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though it's hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani. And proudly too because an Indian did it! I have to be strict... it's an Aamir Khan movie. So I have no option but to cut off 1 for the editing and dubbing errors.9/10. What more do you want? Don't miss it for anything!"
"3 idiots offers a great deal of fun. Indeed, one of the best movies I have ever seen! Its experience is simple, yet it's great in every aspect! I absolutely loved the fact that this film had it all, wonderful atmosphere, brilliant acting, lovely inspiring songs and a surprisingly thrilling story! During the movie, I laughed and cried A LOT!! The combination of the movie aspects was astonishing. I never thought I would enjoy an Indian movie as much as I enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire, but this one simply surpasses every other Indian movie. The story is touching, inspiring and funny.. at the same time!! This movie is plain FUN. It's about family, friendship and a little bit of romance. It had a great deal of great family moments that are still stuck in my mind till now (I saw the movie a week ago!) Plus it deals with friendship and its impacts on a person's life, and what a brilliant friendship story we saw in this movie! One of the greatest friendship stories captured on cinema mixed joyously with top-notch fun. I recommend this movie to anyone who actually wants to enjoy a real movie experience that has it all, in other words.. this movie is recommended for EVERYONE! Acting: 10, Direction: 9, Soundtrack: 10, Story: 10, Overall rating: A decent 10!Don't just rent it, OWN it and show it to friends who like to enjoy a fun movie!"
"When I look back at the films I've watched working my way through the top 250, and I see the over rated bollywood films, I feel a bit of shame for the few of these I watched before realizing none of them belonged on the list. There was all the promise of a top 250 film. After all, it was on the list, it had the rep. But then the experience of watching was painful. It felt wrong. Not like a top 250 film should. At first I thought there was something wrong with me. Maybe I just wasn't doing it right. But then in the end, after asking around, I realized that this film was just awful, and it had played the exact same trick on countless other viewers. Don't be a victim! Rate these films 1 star and keep the list clean!"
"3 Idiots is way too short a movie, which is simply another way of saying that it is an extremely entertaining movie! Raju Hirani has served an hat trick. Three great movies in a row. Raju has brought his Gandhigiri to the world of education, this time the Gandhian is Rancho.Acting is great by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and the best Omi Vaidya or Chatur, without whom 3 idiots would not have been what it is.Its almost impossible to find any significant deviations to excellence when you have a team like this one. Raju, Boman, Aamir, the perfectionist to name a few.But there were a couple of things under the surface that disturbed me a little bit.To start with the easy one, When you anger your senior in the first 5 minutes of entering the college, you know for sure it cannot end there. So from that point of view, the ragging scene mysteriously ends prematurely. Another one is, Boman Iirani or Virus knows Rancho's dad's monthly income but not his address? They spend 10 years searching for him, why didn't they check the college register?Now for some serious ones.I like Aamir Khan movies because you never ever ever see Aamir, you only see the character he is playing, which is exactly how it should be. Unlike Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan movies where you see the movie stars instead of their characters (exceptions apply of course, for example in ""Chak de India"" you couldn't find Shah Rukh even if you wanted to). In 3 idiots, I got to see Aamir Khan more than a couple of times and I was surprised. That got me thinking, why would our perfectionist entertainer allow for something like this.The plot thickens and the mystery deepens. Hmmmm. So I dug deeper and eventually hit the gold mine. Its not Aamir, it's his character Rancho which has a fundamental flaw that even Aamir could not overcome. Rancho is projected as someone who loves to learn, he wants to take in every ounce of knowledge he can absorb for any source possible. But his actions are that of a revolutionary, from teaching the director on how to teach to mocking the definitions of machines and books. On one side he is a sponge, an introvert on the other hand he is a rebel, and extrovert. These opposites needed reconciliation in the story.Somewhere along the way, even meanness crept in. I am referring to Chatur's switched speech. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every bit of that scene. But that does not mean that it flowed with Rancho's character. I think the writers mixed up Aamir's earlier characters, Aakash from Dil Chahta Hai would do this in a heartbeat, DJ from ""Rang de Basanti"" would probably go one step beyond, but not Rancho and definitely not for a ""demo"". Rancho is pure, or at least that's what Raju is portraying him. The same goes with the climax. Now, even though, all of us cheered when Chatur got shafted towards the end in a strange twist of fate. Some how I had a hard time believing that filing 400 patents and signing with the Japanese gel well with this Gandhian educator.Aamir, in his interview, mentioned his approach to looking young in the movie. His pacings, mannerisms, style of dialogue delivery etc. He executes brilliantly on them.Madhavan is decent. He could have been much better.Omi Vaidya, or Chatur, is the real find of this movie. Hope to see more from him.One additional aspect which is not easily apparent is that this is one of the few movies that projects intelligence with the coolness it deserves, and not in the traditional Hollywood style of nerd portrayal. This is a better role model for students. Towards that end it is on par with Matrix.To make it clear, this movie is vastly more entertaining than most of the movies of 2009. But I am not comparing this movie with other movies, that would be like comparing apples with windows. I am comparing this to other Aamir and Raju Herani movies. And in that comparison, this does not shine as bright.______________________Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.* Raggers are caught by the director and are convinced without any ""pressure"" not to rag any more * Reconcile Rancho's character's fundamental flaw, requires serious deep dive * Motivation for Chatur's speech prank redone, maybe not even instigated by Rancho * Some better reason why nobody can find Rancho * Redo the Javed Jaffery scene where he talks to his dead father, turning the tables to show that Javed actually wanted to take his father to Disney Land but his father kept on insisting that they wait for the highway contract to go thru. That would be hilarious. * Sharman Joshi's family is so central to him but are missing 10 years later, in the starting scene, some how bring them in. Maybe his wife is on the phone talking to his sister, happily married in Bombay, when she yells ""No Pants"".This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/3-idiots.html"
"I've decided to start this review by describing what happened during the screening of this movie in one of my University class to demonstrate just how interesting this movie really is.Our lecturer has decided to replace one of our classes on a weeknight and during the class, he has decided to show us this movie. The class started at 8 p.m. and as my class consist of students who are used to skipping classes (even the afternoon ones) or are prone to leaving early (including myself), I was expecting the class to be almost empty by the end of it.By the end of the class, which was about 11.30 p.m., none of the students actually left the lecture hall because everyone really enjoy the movie so much and all of us wanted to finish the movie because it was fun, interesting and inspiring.The movie has tackled an important aspect in the modern society: Why do we study ? Is it only for the sake of getting a well-paid job in the future ? Or was it for the knowledge or interest ? This movie had us questioning our purpose of studying and whether we are doing it for the sake of our future job, to fulfill our parents' demands and expectation or to feed our hunger for knowledge ?All of us go to school for a different reason, some to make friends or to hang out with their friends, there are some who really enjoys learning new things everyday but many are those who go to school just for the sake of completing their studies.The movie tries to bring out this point through humor, loads of them ! The movie is really funny and through unfolding the events by looking into the past and present, it avoids being too straight forward which in my opinion, keeps the audience interested in the movie without getting bored.I really love the movie and has always recommended people to watch it, in fact, everyone that I know who have watched the movie loved it. This movie is really one of my favorite movies of all time."
"I was eager to watch this movie as the only bollywood films i like are those of aamir khan. When i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that this movie could be the best of all time in bollywood, but it considerably failed to be. The plot was somewhat interesting , the cast was very appropriate, the acting was superb, the dialogues were wonderful , but the director maybe oozing with overconfidence, tried to put just too much in it. He tried to put it in ALL the good and bad things a teenager should do while he is in college. It was hard to identify the real protagonist in this movie, and even in the end i was left wondering whether raju was the man in the spotlight or aamir. What i hate to watch and hear is a meaningless song with meaningless lyrics and meaningless dance. And thats just what was very prominent in the movie. I don't understand the purpose of such futile non-sense, is it because people like it ? OH REALLY??? or is it because the director finds it attractive? attractive like - cow dung over cake.!? Another flaw i noticed was the change in character of aamir - from when he was a small kid to his teenage years. He looked and behaved like the most innocent one and out-of-all-activities one and later he became the most notorious and daring guy in college. Let the movie be pathetic or super-hit , boman irani was as always at his peak. His character was very well presented and he did just fine enough to make him the funniest as well as the most brutal character in the movie. The movie also had a lot of dramatic, sensitive scenes, at the wrong times, which did at times bring tears in my eyes, and left the other brain-left-at-home audience sob while staring at the screen. I wont say anything about Kareena because there isn't any need to publicize her flaws, there's a need to look for the minimal positivity in her enacting of her cameo. Rest was very appeasing , it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless, and the film was worth watching. 7/10"
"There was an article published by Time magazine some years ago. It explained that while China enjoys a robust population and a rigorous educational system (for those who can afford it), the spontaneous and creative aspects of Chinese culture has been subverted. It's been marginalized so much so that American business specialists have been asked to speak at some of china's most prestigious companies to ""teach"" creativity. The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.Subtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I can't help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.But while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the dean's daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.Bollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.I saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.Stop to consider today's modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of ""do what you can,"" or ""you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love"". And let's not forget the common contemporary comedy message ""have fun and worry about the consequences later."" These messages make sense in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years don't have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if you're not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, you're legally dead.Those who are worried about China's looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle it'd be India. It's a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. It's got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But don't lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I don't know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is ""I don't watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks,"" discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why?  Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. I saw 3 Idiots again today and I am surprised it's only my second time. But it feels like only just yesterday that I got to know the 3 musketeers - Farhan, Raju and Rancho. I think that's one of the reason why it's so successful - their easy chemistry.  The 3 characters' arcs are so divisive (each focusing on different aspects of the pursuit of education) but yet so intertwined because of their deep friendship. At the end, I remember walking out of the cinema learning life lessons from a master. This time round watching it at home, I realize why I love it so much. Most films only have one central theme and all the plot revolves around that. 3 Idiots has bigger aspirations - it was deftly balancing multiple themes. It didn't only delve on aspects of education, it also hit on subjects like superficiality, parenting, treating people right etc.  In my opinion, one of the reasons why the film succeeds is that it wasn't preachy. It didn't need 10 minutes to force the schmaltz down your throat, it just throws the idea out there and it hits home. Take a look at Jack Neo's I'm Not Stupid, same big subject but you will vomit out all the top-down schmaltz by the end of the movie. I think 3 Idiots realizes that these ideas for living your life and the pursuit of excellence are in all of our consciousness... We all know them but we just never act against them and allowed it to permeate our lives from way back.  The film only needs to throw out the ideas, package them in a fresh approach and it hits the home run. None of the ideas needed to linger longer than it was necessary. I love the narrative structure which is actually a road movie.  Most directors will just do tough love in a linear manner. 3 Idiots uses flashback very effectively. If you think about it, we are only seeing Farhan's version of Rancho for 95% of the film. How do we know that's the real version? The real Rancho only appears right at the end.  The use of screwball comedy works remarkably well too. In fact, the tone switches like the mind of an idiot suffering from a tri-polar complex. For instance, in the ending of the second act, the birthing of Mona's baby in the midst of the biggest flood and rain. I loathe these birthing scenes in movies. Always feel like some fake big life affirming moment but seeing how it is handled here I am so awed. Not pretentious and look at how the tone switches like crazy - from sad (expulsion from ICE), to tension (no transport to the hospital and no electricity), to full-on problem solving (the theme of what education is for culminates here), to comedy, to celebration, back to total sadness again ('death' of baby) and to the closing metaphor of ""All Izz Well"". Freaking brilliant. It was then I realized the director builds up the ""All Izz Well"" metaphor all through the film until that point. And it didn't end there. That last speech by the professor to Rancho in the driving rain closed up, no, bookended what actually began in their first meeting where Rancho asks why didn't the astronauts use a pencil in space. This is what CLASS is about and this film has truckloads of it. The only misstep for me is the romance angle between Pia and Rancho wasn't totally satisfying. Their cute meet is really awesome but if Pia has learned anything from Rancho, why would she still want to marry Mr Pricetag in the end?  I know it was just a narrative ploy to get all the parties together for the final journey to meet Rancho but it didn't feel right for me.  But really, I am just nitpicking. I apologize if I let out some spoilers but seriously if you have not seen this, you must be the type of person that I mentioned about in the first paragraph."
"Being an Indian I have seen a lot of Bollywood movies which do not live upto international standards. 3 Idiots is no different. It's a masala movie, which will draw only mainstream and dumb folk. It might be attractive to the viewers outside as such experiences are new to them, however the truth is that this movie doesn't deserve any place in any top lists on IMDb. I'm sure that the people who have given it a 10/10 have never seen any other movie on the top 250 list. It was a major hit in Indian theatres and any rational,logical and a real movie buff can never like this sort of an impractical movie. To be honest, for an Indian movie I'd give it a 6/10 , however on an international scale it would barely get a 5. If you want to watch a good Indian movie, I'd recommend watching Dev.D which I rate as an 8/10; and I feel should be on the top 250 list. Make a wise decision"
"this movie has a lot of things to tell us ..it shows us the extremely huge power of the mind and when the people are free,use their minds correctly and do what they really love as a job in their lives and not what the other people say to them,only then they success,and most of all they are happy and they can live every time of their lives..a movie with so much fun and suspense,with so great direction gives a so inspired result,and everyone will be full of emotions and optimism..i really thought that bollywood was some kind of parody,but without so much fun,without good direction and a lot of things like these..i am really sorry for that but i couldn't know..i thought that they were extemporaneous...fortunately,that movie made me wrong..it showed me that the films from east have so much fantasy and inspiration that i could never imagine..you have to see it!!"
"The last one month, movie lovers enjoyed best movies like PAA, AVATAR, and now 3 idiots. these three movies are having different genre but provided best entertainment. 3 idiots is also good movie but not the best as per my view. Acting wise Amir khan is best. sharman, r. madhavan , kareena,boman irani did fine job too. Now where i differ others is the whole idea of movie is adaptation of MUNNABHI MBBS on different background. After interval the movie is like munnabhai MBBS part 2. same situations and scenes. when i came out of the hall i felt like director decided the start and end of the movie first, and then wrote the script, created the situations, characters later. This is my opinion of the film, this may hurt others but when i think about it as Rajkumar hirani film. I don't expect the same tried and tested scenes in his movie. For me the second half of movie was weaker part. I hope Rajkumar hirani and abhijat joshi will work on better scripts next time. Overall the movie is timepass and watchable but not the masterpiece, we have seen better work from Rajkumar Hirani in his first two movies"
"The very fact that the education system in my country (and perhaps in a lot of developing countries) SUCKS and as a student, I am seriously suffering from it, makes this movie worth watching. It gives me a little hope, a little faith, that success and happiness will eventually come to those who pursue excellence in stead of just focusing on their grades, their qualifications. I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 ""job"" but it also deprive us of our sleep. The working environment is so damn competitive, our parents are like 'get straight A's or you will have nothing to eat' and the stress is unbearable. So, if you are having to deal with all these, give this movie a try! Good laughs, great messages, enjoyable story."
"'3 Idiots' tried to walk the same path as Hirani's debut 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' but while 'M.B.B.S.' was entertaining in parts and stays consistent, '3 Idiots' is a mess. The film itself lacks direction and the story tries to tackle too many issues, each of which are poorly and superficially handled. It is easy to notice that the film tries to be another 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.'. While some of the jokes are funny, most of them are ripped off from unacknowledged sources (mostly European commercials). I suppose it's become a new trend in Bollywood to rip off old and obscure commercials since the writer lacks an original idea. The songs are easy on the ears but forgettable. Aamir Khan is miscast. He is too old for the part and does not convince at all as a university student. Madhavan too looks old for his part but not as poorly cast as Aamir. Sharman Joshi may look the part but he does overact. Boman Irani is irritating and Kareena Kapoor is strictly average. I'm surprised that so many people are calling this the best movie of the decade. '3 Idiots' is bad."
"Well, Aamir is proving, he also just cannot keep doing only great movies, and needs the dough. From QSQT, he can do a student role. No big deal. Have we run out of jokes, with all these laughter challenges and standup fresh material, we need to use, how does a induction motor start? This is three smart guys, thinking audience is a bunch of idiots. It is a run of the mill, bollywood, melodramatic, no substance, BS....are they running out of slapstick, that they had to try the peeing scene twice or did they like the joke soooo much? Besides, Boman Irani, who takes his every role seriously and delivers top notch performance, and does it professionally, the rest is run of the mill. Just because you make posters that look like tarey zameen par, the movie does not become one. You know what is funny? Khan says do not be pressurized to deliver, and do your own thing....but looks like he is so pressurized, and he cannot do anything different, and keeps falling for Mr Ideal, and student....Mr Khan...when you start making smart movies, do not for once, assume the audience is dumb or idiots. WE have the rest of the 99 movies already doing that...and if the movie is not ready, let us wait.... sucking a baby out with a vacuum that runs on car battery based inverters....hmm....400 patents....and you want us to believe.... why did the lap top screen go off, when the power went? I thought they work on batteries? In which airline, the programs on entertainment system start, before take off? Looks like they needed some pocket money urgently, and made this all in a haste....i have not read the book...I am sure there is a lot of bollywood...may be one day I will ask someone who has read the book.Oscar? forget it."
"This was a good year for Indian cinema, with movies like Dev.D,Gulal, Siddharth: the Prisoner and Kaminey giving a new direction. I was expecting that 3 idiots will be like a Lassi after having a spicy Panjabi Dinner but alas, Aamir disappointed once again. I do not mind losing my 200 bugs, but surely mind losing my precious hair. This movie is very loosely based upon Five point some one and has done balatakar of it. you will feel sleepy after listening Aamir's boring lecture about, life and education. He makes extra efforts to look like a student which unfortunately failed miserably. In the first half in a scene Aamir goes to one of his room mate's home. That scene makes such a mockery of their poverty that i feel like slapping the director. If that scene is not enough to cause headache, than baby delivery scene in the second half surely does. And than comes the Aamir's great invention, making a inventor for the cars batteries, wow that will make even Einstein proud. The only positive thing about the movie is some two or three good one liner and two songs."
"first thing I want to thank and of course congratulate all the person who became part of this sensational movie , it was really a heart-piercing movie :) It made me cried honestly :) . And after I watched this movie I really admired and idolized Aamir Khan :) my best ACTOR and of course the my BEST IDOL ever ! :) . This movie also inspired me most and I was able to apply the learning in my daily living , It was an enlightenment for me in terms of importance of friendship and family in my life ;) and of course I too as a person . Lets continue supporting Bollywood movies :) as well as Aamir Khan. ! Thank YOU!"
"What can I say, when the whole world is pouring accolades on the movie. Going by the reviews I too ventured to the movie with the whole family. In return what we go was crude jokes, tasteless scenes, senseless situations. The climax aptly summarizes the misery.At the end we realized that they almost re-made Munna Bhai MBBS all over again. This time around they just replaced Doctors with Engineers, Medical college with Engg College & Munna Bhai with Rancho. However at least the former was a clean comedy.If you are still curious about the movie, leave your kids behind & go watch at your own risk"
"It is only if I had not lost my movie sensibility, I would have been placed better. The best part about India is that everything has a following and Aamir Khan with his histrionics and verbal spats is in the midst of a great purple patch. Everything he is touching is turning into gold and it takes a modern day genius to do that. He is more like a good salesman then an actor. If you can sell the same college song after 21 years, you sure have to be awarded the best salesman in your industry. Well, the real disappointment is not Aamir, as he frequently makes bad movies...Fana and Ghajini to name just the latest 2 but he also carves out little gems like Taare Zameen Par every now and then. And the disappointment is also not from the fact that he is still playing the college Romeo. The disappointment is with Raj Kumar Hirani who in trying to accommodate Aamir's star power did what Shubhash Ghai did in Yaadein. The Box office verdict has been starkly different for both the movies because young India connects to the message of 3 idiots well. Critics with a few exceptions did not speak their mind because they knew that this movie was going to do colossal business. But the fact remains a fact....the ending was manufactured and seriously pretending. It was like that the script writer was superficially trying to make everybody smile while walking out. It is the first time Hirani has erred and hope that he does not slip again, as he has given 2 most memorable movies in recent memory. This does not even come close. The point of view was excellent, the treatment not."
"I have a 17 year old daughter preparing for college;this morning i told her to watch the movie and even to invite her schoolmates to watch it together.The movie is really entertaining,very well directed,the actors trying to do their best.İt has all the features of Indian cinema,colorful,bright,dancing sequences,songs.I want to believe in rancho's philosophy,though unfortunately i am aware that those thoughts are very naive regarding the real world of jungle.all college students,the ones preparing to be and most importantly,their parents should spare some time for this movie.if all the people in the world behaved like that all would be so fine:)thanks to all the production and casting crew.."
"The movie is supposed to be based on Chetan Bhagat's guideline for IITs Five Point Someone.It not entirely true to it.and in the end it does take a turn that is reminiscent of the ever loving Shawshank Redemption in more ways than one.such as Sharman Joshi's candid confession in an interview besides the end!The film manages a comic depth,what it, at much of the times lacks is emotional depth.It treats issues too naively perhaps.It creates caricatures out of Bhagat's characters.it does hinder character development.Boman Irani's Dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe(VIRUS) did remind me of his own Dr.Asthana in Hirani's debut Munnabhai M.B.B.S. Asthana's funny guffaws were character traits but Virus hasn't any he tries to be whatever is required.He is funny,he is ruthless but never as formidable as Asthana. 3I is not par stereotypes thus is predictable.It also delves in silliness and goes from melodramatic extremes to comic extremes in seconds.But all said the movie is just too funny. I have not laughed so much in days.Its certainly written better than the novel(apparently not a difficult thing to do).Lead Performances are very good too.In the end its easily lovable but forgettable unlike LRMunnabhai.Its not at all a bad movie but maybe just not brilliant.Lead Actor's own Taare Zameen Par would be a brilliant document on education system.I rate it 7/10."
"For starters, every cinephile must watch this movie, it's absolutely mandatory!!!! The movie has great story line, rich in its roots, evolves naturally, showing beautiful landscapes of India. All characters are so dense, so real, so credible, despite of being caricatured....there is a lot of marvelous interactions between them all way down the story...and their interaction onto scenarios are great and constant...that's one thing I could notice it made the movie such a strong production.... The film is funny, genius, superb, surprising, fading from touching moments to challenging scenes, so naturally...... Reamrkable photography as well. It's one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen - is deep, enjoyable and, ultimately, leaves a lesson about what is really important in life.... I recommend the family watch this movies, together...is outrageous!!! It mention taboos, the everyday's strive of families, hopes, dreams, disappointing, love, envy, debauch, etc.... And all this magic moment, start with an aborted airplane take-off......"
"I loved this movie, it was a very smart and enjoyable movie despite the length. I loved the characters specially Rancho, Pro Virus and Silencer. I am not a fan of music in movies but I loved the music in this movie. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the name: 3 idiots is not appropriate, it should have been ""Looking for Rancho"" or ""Al-its-wel"". Another thing was It doesn't explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldn't express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear. Well despite all this it shows Hollywood that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time, and a college movie doesn't have to be about stupid humor, booze, bombshells and boobies."
"After some really bad experiences with Hindi Movies especially Mangal Pandey, I stopped watching any Hindi movie during first 3 days of its release and normally downloads them from internet except Aamir's movies. Though I have been eagerly waiting to watch 3 Idiots but still I read some 6-7 reviews on different websites before going to the movie. All of the reviews were positive so I decided to spend my money this time on theatre on first day first show.Pros1. Lots of hilarious scenes a. The Teacher's Day speech By Omi: Even if I give you the whole script of the scene, I can bet that you will definitely burst out laughing while watching this scene (an aged sardar had to go out of theatre because he couldn't handle so much laughter in the scene) . b. Scene at Sharman's house where these 3 had dinnerc. Kareena's Sister wedding scened. And lots of one liners too2. Awesome acting by Aamir After watching Ghajini, you will be amazed to see how this guy managed to transform himself into a 20+ college going student and actually looks like one. The spontaneity especially in the scene when he talked to Boman Irani during the cremation of a student makes him the best actor bollywood has ever produced 3. Camaraderie between Aamir, Sharman and MadhvanAfter RDB, this triplet has done it yet again!! See the scene where they are drinking on stairs and Sharman and Madhvan challenge Aamir4. Chemistry between Aamir & Kareena All efforts goes to Aamir for this who manages to look so young that this pair never looks odd and chemistry between them was also amazing5. Realizations in the characters All the characters except Rancho (Simply because I haven't find or heard of such a genius till now) in the film seems real and you can relate them to one or other in your real life. This brings the film all the more close to your heart6. Message of the film A well-deserved strike on the existing education system where rot learning has become part of the life of every student (including myself who followed the blind race of Engineering & MBA without knowing what I really want to do) 7. Finally, each and every character in the movie fits in his/her role and has gone their true potential. There are many scenes to see that too like Sharman's dilemma and breakdown during one of his interaction with Boman, The way Boman's carries himself as an intelligent but cynic principal, Omi's character etc.8. SongsHonestly telling, before watching the movie I didn't like the songs very much but after the movie I am in love with them especially Give me some sunshine, All Izz well and Zoobi DoobiCons1. Kareena eloping from her marriageThis seems a little bit dramatic in an otherwise realistic movie but considering the whole movie I can bear with this five minutes part and in fact going by the reaction of other audiences, you will love this scene also. 2. Mona Singh Delivery SceneAgain, the thing which was indigestible for me was how a person can manage to create a suction device via a vacuum cleaner in such a short time and that makes Rancho an unrealistic person but I guess this is Indian Cinema and no movie can be a complete reality (this applies to Munna Bhai Series, Aamir's all movies, in fact I should not be talking about realism in Shahrukh's movie) Overall, this movie is worth every single penny of your ticket and you won't regret spending even 300 bucks on this movie. This is guaranteed!!"
