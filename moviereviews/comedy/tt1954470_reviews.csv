"Just saw the screening at the Sydney film festival. Its definitely one of the best Hindi movies ever made. Direction, screenplay, narration, acting, music, cinematography, everything about this movie is top notch. Anurag Kashyap is truly the best at whatever he does. You wont even feel the length of 5 hours and 20 minutes. Manoj Bajpai's has proved once again that he is the powerhouse of acting. Not one scene is out of order and everything is properly explained with no questions unanswered. Dialogues are very sharp and as close to reality as it can get. The opening sequence in itself is a masterpiece. The way its scripted and executed is just mind blowing. All the bloodshed keeps getting more and more innovative. Its one of those movies that will always be mentioned everywhere whenever someone talks about the Indian cinema."
"It has been nearly 5 years since I went and saw a movie first day first show in the theatres. But such was the level of anticipation with ""gangs of wasseypur"" that I found myself standing in front of the ticket counter at quarter to nine. The movie, which is 160 minutes long, starts with a shoot-them-up which may be the most authentic shoot-to-kill scene in Hindi cinema. The movie tells the story of rivalries between different sects of Muslims: the butchers, Qureshis, and the Pathans, Khans and extend over a period of three generations. The story starts from the pre- independence era when the British owned the mines in Dhanbad. After independence, these mines pass on to the wealthy landlord who hires an exiled Pathan to act as his strongman. The pathan, the father of Sardar Khan (Manoj Vajpayee) has been kicked out of his village, Wasseypur, after a confrontation with the local musclemen, the Qureshis, and is now forced to work in the mines of Dhanbad. He starts becoming too big for his shoes and is bumped off by the landlord thus beginning a series of killings and counter-killings. The acting by the ""star"" cast is stunning with Manoj Vajpayee leading the pack in as good as a performance as ""Bheeku Mahatre"" in Satya. When he stares lustfully at the back side of Reema Sen (here resurrected after being in the wilderness for nearly half a dozen years), you can feel the lust as a physical thing. He is backed by a very strong ensemble cast. The real strength of the movie is its dialogues. The words, replete with the choicest of abuses, feel as if they were wiretapped. The conversation rings true to life and had me laughing at the sheer vulgarity of it. The patois is captured very faithfully. The only negative point about the movie is its length which could have been edited somewhat in the second half when the third generation takes up (like the long Godfather III, if you may). Anurag Kashyap has put his soul into the movie and that is visible from every frame of the movie. The direction is the best I have seen this year in Hindi cinema and will only increase the expectations from the second part of this opus. And that is why I am jealous of the lucky bastards at the Cannes film festival who got to see both the parts back to back. The movie ends at a tantalizing junction and the prospect of meeting with these barely lovable characters for a second outing left me salivating."
"I have just returned from the first day late night show of this movie (the first part) and it has totally blown me away. The movie starts with a bang and carries the charm throughout. The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.Siddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.Apart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.The camera angles, especially the final sequence is superb. Anurag Kashyap is India's answer to Quentin Terentino. Gangs of Waseypur is already a Cult."
"Yes, its true.Scorsese and Tarantino are there in Bollywood too,Anurag Kashyap surely belongs to that class.A Movie which gives you the raw look of everything love,ambition,politics,revenge,comedy, this movie has everything in it.I was expecting another disappointment with another Bollywood movie but right from first scene this movie blew me away. The story spans last seven decades of Indian history with events taking place in mining towns of Wasseypur and Dhanbad. The tale of the cities is portrayed in the rivalry between the family of Shahid Khan,an ambitious man who loots trains in British Era by the name of Sultana Daku and Ramdahri Singh and Local Contractor turned Politician. The animosity is passed to the next generation where Sardar Khan portrayed by Manoj Bajpai,who wants to avenge his fathers death by destroying Ramdhari Singh and his family and the Qureshi's who outcast his father. Manoj Bajpai has outclassed himself. Every single actor has done his part perfectly. You will feel like you are actually living in that part of the world. Hats off to the team, they have thoroughly researched every detail and make the whole scenario looked like real. A Must Must watch for if you love quality."
"One of the most awaited movies of the year, the first part of Gangs of Wasseypur lives up to expectations. However, the only disappointing aspect of the movie is that one has to wait for the part two of the movie to see how the story unfolds. The movie is based at Wasseypur and other surrounding areas of Dhanbad. The time-line of the movie spans from early 1940s to early 1990s. The second part of the movie is expected to span from early 1990s to mid 2000s. It's a story of Pathans Shahid Khan (played by Jaideep Ahlawat)and his son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpayee, Qureshis, and politician-cum-coal mine owner-cum- local don Ramadheer Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia)and his son. The tussle between Pathans and Qureshis, and that between Shahid Khan and Sardar Khan on one side and Ramadheer Singh and his son on the other side are the highlights of the movie. In between, one also sees different facets of coal mafia, revenge, rivalries among Muslims, and even love stories too. The movie is intense, gripping, and has a fair sprinkling of cuss words one finds in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the film is based. The music of the film is another highlight, and one needs to watch the film to fully realize the relevance of songs in the film. In short: a must- watch movie for those who love hard hitting movies with great acting from all the actors."
"Premiering at Cannes, this was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Maybe not for the Multiplex going, entertainment seeking audience but for people who actually care for gritty cinema. I, personally, have always been a fan of Anurag Kashyap, Manoj Bajpayee as well as Piyush Mishra. So, for me this movie was like cinematic heaven, before it even started.It is a story unfolding through generations in Wasseypur, Jharkhand(erstwhile Bihar). It starts with Sahid Khan( played brilliantly by Jaideep Ahlawat), who robs trains by the pseudonym of Sultana Daku which is in fact the pseudonym of another Dacoit that lives in the village. So, on one such attempt, the original Sultana Daku kills of Sahid Khan's gang and throws him out of Wasseypur. Thus starts the rivalry of the Khans and the Qureshis. Sahid Khan moves to Dhanbad where he leaves this life of robbery behind him and starts working in a field mine. During child birth, his wife dies while he was unable to reach her in time because he wasn't informed by the authorities. The son grows up over the years and India soon wins independence. With Independence, the British abandon the mines which are soon given to a Jamindar, Ramadhir Singh. He needs Pahalwans(bouncers) to run the mines and keep the workers in control, so he hires Sahid Khan. What Ramadhir Singh did not foresee was that Sahid Khan himself wanted the throne all for himself. When Ramadhir Singh finds out, he sends Sahid for a job at Banaras where Sahid Khan is assassinated. He also tries to kill Sahid's younger brother and son but they escape. The kid grows up to be Sardar Khan( Manoj Bajpayee) whose only aim in life is revenge against Ramadhir Singh, the guy who killed his father. ""Goli Nahi Maarenge Usko, Keh Ke Lenge Uski"".I won't say that if i continue with the story, it'll give the movie away but the thing is every twist and turn of the story, every little detail, Anurag Kashyap wants you to explore for yourself. There are so many characters and so many stories that it becomes more of an epic than a movies. With Piyush Mishra's narration, the movie unfolds smoothly as you will keep watching dumbstruck at the crime and the 'bakaiti'. The usage of slang is in abundance. Definitely, not a movie that you can watch with your family, or even girlfriend, for that matter. Brilliant performances, a brilliant script, and wonderful direction leaves you expecting for more. Waiting for the 2nd part eagerly."
"Just watched this movie today on the day of release.Excellent background music throughout the movie. Excellent acting by Manoj Bajpayee & Richa Chaddha. Superb comedy and action. A movie you need to watch in theaters to enjoy it fully.Dabangg is nothing in front of this movie.This movie is just Entertainment,Entertainment and Entertainment.Had to choose between Teri Meri Kahani & Gangs of Wasseypur today. I am glad that we chose to go for Gangs of Wasseypur.It takes a lot of skill to make a movie like this. I hope it sweeps all the awards this year. Manoj Bajpayee's role as Bhikoo Mhatre was memorable and in this movie his role as Sardar Khan will be more memorable than any of his past performances."
"An epic tale about loyalty, crime, lust, treachery and vendetta. A cinematic magnum opus.Set in Dhanbaad's(Jharkhand)Village, called Wasseypur, ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" starts with our very own ""Kyunki Saas bhi bahu thi"" and goes beyond the cinematic ethics. A saga which has all the ingredients of a cult cinema like black humor, full mouthed characters, adultery, bullets,vengeance and everything you expect in a film by Anurag Kashyap.En route to end of British Raj in India, Shahid Khan, a dacoit, loots the British trains, masquerading as Sultana Daku, is shot dead by Ramadhir Singh's goon. Shahid's son, Sardar Khan, pledges to avenge his father's death and shaves his head. He becomes one of the most notorious gangsters of Wasseypur. The film reconnoiters his connections with power, politics and fraternity of crime. There is a clash between two Muslim groups Pathans and Qureshis, about their covetousness for glory and money.Manoj Bajpai gives an impeccable performance as a violent and lecherous man. It is one of the powerhouse acts, we will ever encounter. The real find of the decade is Tigmanshu Dhuila a well-known cult director (Hassil, Paan Singh Tomar, Saheb Biwi aur Gangster etc), who embodied the character as if he himself is Ramdhir Singh.Richa Chadda is believable as Sardar Khan's anxious and bold wife. Reema Sen is good as a silent and steamy concubine of Sardar Khan.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a born thespian; he is believable as weed smoking, Amitabh's die-hard fan and black sheep of the family. We have already witnessed him in ""Kahaani"" and ""Peepli live"". I think he is one of the most underrated actors, has now got an opportunity to flaunt himself in GOW II(I saw the trailer of Part II after the credit rolled).Rest of the cast Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Huma Quershi(debut-She looks ravishing while persuading the theater's security guard for the second show of the movie ""Trishul"") and others are so authentic that you will easily relate the characters with North India (Bihar), the dialects, the dialogue delivery, the expressions are genuine.The music by Sneha Khanwalkar is down to earth, a triumph, it has the rustic soul and is very unique. One can understand the geniuses by listening the beats and lyrics. Some of them are folks sung by the locals.And after all it's Anurag Kashyap ,who can go to any length to enhance the quality of Indian Cinema. Undoubtedly it has been screened in Cannes,and people watched the entire saga (a delirious 5 Hours 20 Minutes run time) and lauded with the accolades. However, it should have been edited 20 minutes.Impatiently waiting for Part II.8.2/10"
"Gangs of Wasseypur stands firmly on the grounds of direction, acting, screenplay, story-line, cinematography & music. Manoj Pandey has delivered an outstanding performance. The movie has to be rated ""A"" because of a lot of abuses (which implies, its not a family flick). But the essence of it is demanding and commendable. Everyone has done a splendid job. This one is not loose even for a minute. The most important aspect of its appreciation is its star-cast. A lot of new faces and still it doesn't disappoint. You can just imagine the crew on board when actors like Piyush Mishra & Yashpal Sharma are totally wasted. An entertaining cinema worth watching. There is no doubt that Anurag Kashyap is Bollywood's Quentin Tarantino. A must watch."
"Bollywood movies are generally based on fantasy and imagination. Where the audience is made familiar with the characters which he 'wishes' to be.Gangs Of Wasseypur Adopts a different Approach.It makes the Audience identify with reality and makes familiar with the characters that 'are' around him.Being from wasseypur in dhanbad i was super excited to watch the movie based on my locality. i had presumed the movie might be 'inspired' by the gang wars, but no movie is 90% the actual story of the town.The movie has penetrating dialogues, harsh naked truth characters and language. Manoj Bajpayee's acting was breath taking. the scenes are still vivid even after 2 days of watching the movie. His Chemistry with the character 'Durga' was awesome. 'sardar khan's interaction with ramadhir singh in the movie is very interesting. The movie was brilliant in first half. The only place where the movie could improve is that there are so many characters that a normal audience will be confused and may just lose the plot. One needs to watch the movie carefully.9/10 to the movie made about my locality. Wasseypur Zindabad!"
"‎'Gangs of Wasseypur' is a visceral epic! Not the kind of regular rubbish that is churned out every now and then. Mr.Anurag Kashyap has brought us something that can be categorized with the likes of 'The Godfather'.Manoj Bajpayee is rocking and superbly supported by a fabulous Richa Chadda, Reema Sen and Piyush Mishra. And final cherry on the acting caked is Nawazzuddin as a vulnerable young lad who is basically a romantic at heart but is getting transformed into a ruthless gangster much like Michael Corleone in the Godfather series. Manoj Bajpayee's character is quite akin to much more ruthless version of Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather'.By repeatingly mentioning 'The Godfather' I am not trying to take away anything from GOW. GOW is a superb film which needs to be watched by anyone and everyone who has the slightest of respect and love for films and filmmaking.Sneha Khawalker's rockingtingly superb music brings a whole new level of excitement in the film and Rajeev Ravi's cinematography is very very efficient, sprinkled with quite a few shots of sheer brilliance.All this make a nice, superbly tasty biryani and the credit can only go the masterchef Mr.Anurag Kashyap.8/10, and I'd defo recommend all my friends to go and watch this film in CINEMAS!"
"Very few movies are so good in all departments.Script - Engaging, real, entertaining Direction - Flawless Dialogues - Cream of the movie (Go just for the dialogs alone if not anything else) Performance - Outstanding from all actors. It never looks like acting. So real Music - Heart of the storytelling. Compliments way too well. Love you Sneha Cinematography - Best visuals possible for the terrain of wasseypur. It transports you to that place"
"Co-written and directed by Anurag Kashyap, this film will probably propel the filmmaker into the ranks occupied by the likes of Coppola and Scorsese in crafting Mafia styled epics, filled with the themes of brotherhood, revenge, betrayal, sex and violence. Showcased at this year's Cannes Directors' Fortnight with its sequel screened back to back, Kashyap has brought forth a sprawling, three generation span long tale of the titular Gangs of the coal mining town, where three crime families engage one another for infamy, riches and power supremacy.And what he had done to provide some gravitas to this tale, was a semi-documentary look at its background against the town of Wasseypur, where we witness how the wheelings and dealings between shady businessmen and their workers, and how some become politicians through bullying, gangster tactics, the laundering of money, and eventually buying support to ascend the political ladder. It's an intriguing commentary about, by extension, the country's state of affairs, and how some can grow influence through the use of hired muscles out to do their dirty work, for the duration of their useful lifespan, before being discarded.Beginning in explosive fashion with a full assault on a property, key figures get introduced, but only to keep things under wraps until the companion film in Part 2. We then get brought back to the 40s Wasseypur and Dhanbad land, where the British found themselves up against the formidable forces of the Qureshis , only for Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) to impersonate their mysterious leader, pre-empt their attacks and undercut the Qureshis in their own game. Soon the Khans got exiled, only for Shahid to be brought back to Wasseypur when Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia), a rich, corrupt industrialist, needed a muscle man to help in his exploitation of workers. But jealously meant Ramandhir's orders to get rid of Shahid, and thus opening up the feud to the second generation, led by Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) who is hell bent on revenge.But in a tragi-comedy sort of way, the character of Sardar is somewhat tough on the outside with his ruthlessness, but all soft and fuzzy inside with his libido being lacking in control, with first wife Nagma (Richa Chadda) being relatively tolerant of his gallivanting ways only because she gets pregnant too easily, and the introduction of a Bengali girl Durga (Reema Sen) whom he met while on the run. This sets up the third generation of cast with Sardar's sons Danish (Vineet Singh) and Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), with a hint on what's to come disrupt his family dynamics with illegitimate son Definite, entering the picture, whom we'll see more of in the next film whose trailer gets airtime right after the end credits. On the other corner are the heir of the Qureshis in Ehsaan (Vipin Sharma) and Sultan (Pankaj Tripathy), who are caught in the middle with their alliance with Ramandhir, and the marriage of Sultan's sister Sharma (Amirota Jha). And what makes it interesting in the entire male dominated world, is the story of the women behind the men, as seen from the major character arcs on Sardar's family involved in romance of some sort, playing critical roles in defining the male characters and contrasting them in both their private and public lives, and instrumental especially in the final scene, and going into the next film.It might be overwhelming at first with a myriad of characters being introduced, but Kashyap got his presentation all under control like an old hand, bringing on new characters with proper title flashes, and providing adequate screen time for each to establish his or her backstory. This wonderfully crafts out motivations and characteristics of each family member, especially between the sons of Sardar, who will all play pivotal roles in the sequel, since the very first scene here would have shown each of them under different camps, and teasing us with just how allegiances would play out with family members now standing under different banners. Part of the engagement now would be to develop the narrative to reach the inevitable, and with the ensemble set up, the possibilities are endless.And as such, Gangs of Wasseypur has its fair share of surprises thrown about, where those slighted will almost always come back with a vengeance. Revenge may be high on Sardar's agenda, but there's a permeating poetic justice that provides a cruel twist of irony, with the narrative rich enough to allow various subplots to populate the story and to add a vivid texture to the characters instead of letting them become one dimensional characters. It's a sprawling epic that called upon the best of Bollywood sans the usual Masala formula, to showcase the skills, craftsmanship and talent in the industry that are capable of making a serious, critically acclaimed film with commercial appeal. Definitely highly recommended, although I'm reserving judgement until Part 2 when the film is complete. If you haven't watched an Indian film for some time already, if at all, then make Gangs of Wasseypur your launch point now."
"""Then there was the whole concept of coal mining, which is a culture unto itself, the most dangerous occupation in the world, and which draws and develops a certain kind of man."" Martin C. SmithManoj Bajpai wants revenge on Tigmanshu Dhulia who had treacherously killed his father. Sometimes there comes a story which has an epic kind of sweep. Spanning generations, introducing several characters, all caught up in empire building, love, lust and enimity. There isn't much point to them, the protagonists aren't clearly defined, the storyline meandering, their lives entwined in the events that befell the nation and the small town that the story inhabits. Set in the backdrop of Wasseypur, a small part of Dhanbad, capital of India's coal belt, numerous characters come and go. India gains independence, Emergency is imposed, coal mining is first unionized and later nationalized. However, the story, at its core remains about Tigmanshu's star rising ever higher and Manoj building his own empire from humble origins, while seeking revenge.There are times when you wish things would happen quicker. That there were less characters. Or that there was a point to some of them, who are introduced to either only die or shine bright for a few frames before being forgotten. The environment is beautifully captured, including the lingo, the mannerisms whether it's the abject despair of the poor mine worker, condemned to live his life in the black shafts. The bestiality of the butcher, as he hacks away at his meat. The cowardice of the cops. The empty bravado of the minister's goons. Or the naked lust as hungry men eye their next catch, the woman to slake their base desires, even as the wife lies at home, pregnant. However, there are several things which let the film down. For a film set in the coal belt, we see very little of it. Apart from one memorable scene where, caked in the black coaldust, a few men fight for their lives and another where coals water absorption properties are highlighted, there is too little was about the black mineral and much more made of ancillary businesses. National events of importance are also given short shrift or brushed over, their impact shown quickly, transitions happening smoothly rather than in real life where each change creates havoc in such a tiny eco-system. Great camera work, flawless performances, several one-liners and very catchy music keep you engaged, though, as our two key protagonists slug it out and religion comes in, with different sects of Muslims engaging in war amongst each other. The story moves forward with a Godfather-esque gait, a kind of glacial majesty, in stops and starts, not always making sense. But then, isn't that how real life is ?"
"*I am not a fan of Indian film, mostly I hate it, but Gang of Wasseypur is good. It is not the typical Indian movie with lot of dancing and typical good guy as lead character.Watching Gang of Wasseypur is like watching The Godfather instead of watching Indian movies.The main core of the story is almost similar with The Godfather, but overall with the Indian aspect in it, the story is different. the writer picked real events that happened in India, and put it in the story. So there is little bit history lesson of India there, which is cool.The character is very different with the Godfather counterpart, Sardar Khan is not like Vito Corleone, he is more violence and kinda selfish, although their core story almost similar. But they are totally different character. The other filler characters is totally different.Good news , there is no dancing in this movie, but surprisingly, there is many good soundtracks in this film. They put great traditional Indian music instead the typical music in Indian movies.If you like The Godfather I think you can appreciate this Gang of Wasseypur, even if you hate Indian movies like me. This is not typical Indian movies, totally worth checking."
"Gangs of Wasseypur is a 2012 Hindi crime movie directed and co-written by Indian movie-maker Anurag Kashyap starring veteran Indian actor Manoj Bajpai in the lead role. The five hour long movie premiered at the Directors' Fortnight section—an independent section held in parallel to the Cannes Film Festival—at the 65th Cannes Film Festival. However, as far as the commercial release of Gangs of Wasseypur is concerned, the makers have decided to screen it in two parts of roughly 150 minutes each. Set in Wasseypur—the Muslim-majority district surrounding Jharkhand's (earlier a part of Bihar) coal capital, Dhanbad—Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur is a crime saga that revolves around the three-generation long sanguinary rivalry between two disputing Muslim clans: the 'Khans' and the 'Qureshis'. However, this bloody battle is not religious but strictly territorial in nature as the two clans indulge in incessant fights seeking carte blanche to run their respective crime syndicates in Wasseypur. It's worth mentioning that the events and circumstances depicted in Gangs of Wasseypur are fictionalized accounts of the real life events that occurred in the district of Wasseypur during the pre and post-independence India.Anurag Kashyap's crime saga, irrespective of its entertainment quotient, marks a new beginning in Indian Cinema. It is for this very reason that Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be an essential viewing for anyone whose purpose for indulging in Cinema is not limited to seeking entertainment. Amongst the new crop of Indian movie makers, Anurag Kashyap seems to have a definite edge to be the obvious choice to lead the Indian juggernaut in the global arena. Now, whether Kashyap lives up to the expectations is for the time to decide, but what can be safely said at this stage is that with Gangs of Wasseypur Kashyap has significantly bolstered his prospects as a moviemaker. Gangs of Wasseypur, Kashyap strives to strike the right balance between various cinematic elements that helps the movie touch the lows and highs of cinema, thereby helping it break the stereotype associated with quintessential Bollywood Cinema. Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a highlight-reel of some of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed in Indian Cinema depicting shootouts, prison-breaks, brawls, bomb blasts, rallies, kidnappings, rapes, train-robberies, forced marriages, women in labor, lovemaking, killings, and butchery. One interesting facet that makes these scenes really effective is the level of realism and conviction with which they are carried forward in the movie. In Gangs of Wasseypur, Anurag Kashyap presents a grim picture of human decadence: Amongst the hundreds of masculine characters depicted in the movie, one doesn't get to witness a single likable character, for most of them come across as bestial beings desperate to serve their basic instincts of survival, physical love, wealth and power. On the other hand, the women are portrayed as secondary beings who are looked upon by men as materialistic pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits. Manoj Bajpai delivers a tour de force in Gangs of Wasseypur. His portrayal of Sardar Khan ranks right up there with the very best performances in the history of Indian Cinema. Sardar is ferocious killer as well as a voracious lover whose feral instincts to kill (his adversaries) are remarkably matched by his play boyish passion to for physical love. The rest of the cast gives memorable performances that help bring characters to life with a special mention of Nawazuddin Siddiqui whose underplayed cameo as Sardar Khan's younger son offered a great contrast to Manoj Bajpai's over the top portrayal. Siddiqui is expected have a major role in the second part of Gangs of Wasseypur considering the similarities of his part to Al Pacino's Michael Corleone. Whether Siddiqui will succeed in carving a niche for himself as Pacino had managed with his portrayal in The Godfather I & II is for the time to decide. The Cinematography of Gangs of Wasseypur is at par with the best in the world. Kashyap's sense of timing with the use of music is also exemplary. Kashyap expertly introduces occasional bursts of music and comedy to punctuate the slowly augmenting tension tension at different junctures in the movie. Kashyap's use of dark humor to judiciously propagate violence has an uncanny similarity to Quentin Tarantino's style of filmmaking. His choice of music in the movie's final sequence that depicts the brutal killing of one of movie's major characters à la 'Sonny Corleone' assassination in The Godfather is bizarre yet remarkably effective.Overall, Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a unique cinematic experience that's not free of its flaws. However, despite its apparent flaws, Gangs of Wasseypur has enough to offer to a keen movie-viewer who would not allow him/her to be overwhelmed by movie's abundance of everything. Gangs of Wasseypur serves be a sanguinary carnival of epic proportions that's surely not meant for the faint-hearted. The movie is an essential viewing for the lovers of Indian cinema, for they will get to see something really refreshing in Gangs of Wasseypur, and also for those who want to get acquainted with it."
"After a series of duds movie is bollywood, this movie had regain the faith in bollywood industry & trust me it came from a hardcore hater of bollywood cinema. I think after Rang de basanti, this is the only movie which is at par with Hollywood.Each & every character in the movie seems to be destined to play their respective roles, be it Sardar Khan or Shahid Khan or Danish Khan or my personal favorite (actually quite a discovery) Ramadhir Singh. The beauty of this magnum opus lies in its sheer brilliance in acting deptt & the mammoth courage of Mr. Kashyap to envisage & put it in screen for us. Actually this movie had given me quite a hangoverThanks Mr. Kashyap for reinforcing the faith. I will await for your next!!!"
"The good thing for the film was its screening in two parts. It's not that you will not like the film for 5 hours but there are a few moments when you might feel bored. Now about the film I would say that this is the only film that I can remember now, the characters of which you would bond so much. Making such a long film is a great risk and that was worth it. The story is purely based on revenge. What these 5 hours has made us feel in the end was that the revenge was truly authentic. You will bond entirely with all that hatred. Of Course we have to pick up a side with whom we sympathize. The shaking feeling was when Ramadheer singh told Faisal that the whole fighting had started due to his grandfather and he wanted to live, otherwise his grandfather might have killed him. This was the moment when I realized that he was not at all wrong in his place of thinking. But then I also realized the power of films. The director wanted us to have sympathy with the family of Manoj Vajpayee. That is one angle of showing the film. There can be a story made from the point of Ramadheer where we will sympathize with him.While watching the film I felt like I am revisiting a lot of films. There were a lot of instances when one can feel that he is watching the Indian version of godfather. Now the way this film is made defines what inspiration is. I also felt in the last 30 minutes like I was watching instances of City of God. Anurag Kashyap has properly set a standard for the Indian Directors about how to take inspiration from foreign films. When the audience sees that the starting scenes and the characters which were shown so early are linked in the end, they are hooked to the seats. They might feel amazed at that instant (also considering the fact that all these important twists and links are shown in the last 20 minutes of the film) and say that the film is amazing after leaving theater. While this is obvious for the Indian Audience who is deprived of such stories since they are used to watch senseless themes of Cocktail and many others. So, I would not say that the story or anything is so amazing, but this is what the audience of India need to start with. There is a lot more potential in filmmaking and I have no doubt that Anurag Kashyap too has that power to make films like the seventh seal. But he is bound by the mindset of our audience. I believe that he is taking his viewer's through a carefully chosen path to make them mature enough to understand films of Ingmar Bergman or Stanley Kubrick.PROS:The film has a good story along with good performances which is the first reason to watch the film. To keep the viewer engaged, the film has a lot of twists till the end. I would not consider this film in the black comedy genre but it definitely has so many instances when you will praise the director for his witticism. Coming over to the songs, I felt that the soundtrack was better in the second part. The best humoristic moment in the film was when the two goons were catching each other and their bikes went out of petrol. That moment was too hilarious. Both are standing in the queue to fill the tank. There are many instances like this which gives you authentic feel of India. The second part bagged good songs as well. The portrayal of the ladies in the family was awesome. The way that the film involved us in their daily household activities was something not usual in Indian Films. Coming to the characters, I got attached with Nawajuddin Shiddiki much more than Manoj Vajpayee. His portrayal was very close to that of Al Pacino in Godfather. All the supporting cast performed extremely well.In all, rarely in Indian cinema has this type of film been made especially with so much characters and their development.MESSAGE: ""!!Revenge!!""VERDICT: ""A must watch"""
"Brilliant...just brilliant. An exhilarating movie experience which demands to be seen only on big screen for its rustic visuals which takes you straight into raw and rugged heartland. Very very entertaining as well and humor keeps you to the edge of the seat throughout. At times it reminded me of Sholay on epic, comedy and entertainment level.Though not for people with faint-heart, GOW bleeds excellence in almost every frame and every scene. An epic and brutal saga spanning over decades and generations. Its epic, visceral and poetic all at the same time.Watching GOW on big screen wasn't just watching a movie but an experience. An experience which also proves Anurag Kashyag as the face of new age Indian cinema after GOW, Black Friday, Dev-d. And how can I forget the brilliant No Smoking which was quite David Lynchish. Manoj Bajpayee is impeccable and irreplaceable in his career best performance.Music is fantastic and specially how well the music have been utilized is another USP of the movie. For example the beautiful ""Ik bagal mein chand hoga..ik bagal me rotiya"" from Piyush Mishra. Suddenly the mood and visual of the film changes. The song reminds you of some 50-60's lullaby and how poetically it has been shot reminds you of Bimol Roy's classic ""Do Beegha Zameen"". So many references of the era gone by...from those colorful posters to Bachchan era..to the era of violence and lawlessness of such places..at times it feels like poetry in motion.Just magnificent...Indian cinema at its best!!"
"Anurag Kashyap's ambitious Epic Gangs of Wasseypur is a lethally long and detailed view of the life of a single gangster family and not gangs exactly. Spread across 7 decades and over three generations it tells an authentically made and wickedly enjoyable romp of violence, politics, power and sex.The film begins in the early 40s with the genesis of the gangs getting formed between the Muslim communities of the Qureshis (Butcher clan) and the Pathans. Trying to take advantage of this divide is the local contractor of coal mines Ramadheer Singh (director Tingmanshu Dhulia).As the film progresses, the three groups transition from one criminal activity to another and keep slowly increasing their enmity siding with one another. The Coal mafia point is lost midway and the criminal activities start ranging from human trafficking to even fisheries extortion. What strikes from the word go is the sheer realism of the ganglands of Bihar from nearly perfect performances of the very believable Bihar characters, to the dress sense punctuated by what is an almost unheard of in your face soundtrack made up of local Bihari hits mixed in modern sounds, this is Anurag's best in terms of art direction (maybe only bettered by his far superior Black Friday) There is so much going on in the movie that at times it's hard to enjoy all of it. The sexually crude songs playing constantly in the back ground, the numerous acts of violence (at times hard to connect) or for that matter the out and out vulgar dialogues spouted by pretty much all the characters of the film.However there is one major drawback which makes the film's narration slightly uneven and over dependent on a poorly placed cricket-like commentary to bridge the gaps. For example not much is shown or discussed of how the coal mafia operated other than the commentary and thus we get only glimpses of how the other two gangs, The Qureshi's Butcher Gang (led by Sultan) and Ramadheer Singh's sophisticated political gang, are evolving. Instead, the script chooses to spend almost incessant time on the family and life of the alpha male Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) including his long drawn out romance with the Bengali immigrant Durga (a very hot Reema Sen) Sardar Khan's Feisty wife Nagma (played perfectly by Richa Chaddha) ends up having more screen space than the main antagonist Ramadheer Singh (who could have been a tour de force). In the end Ramadheer Singh comes across more as a weakling against a thug like Sardar Khan. A little hard to believe considering he's been a landlord for a long time and is a politician to boot. I guess with the film being made by Anurag Kashyap, a lot of folks will tell you that this is an awesome film which could hype-kill the movie. It is undoubtedly a masterstroke in terms of gritty depiction of the ganglands but it could easily have been a lot crisper and stayed a little true to its title.You could also give a benefit of a doubt to the script considering there is the still to be released second part which requires the side characters to take centre stage and hence so much time spent on their development.Of course, the 3 hour long film picks up in the last thirty minutes when the third generation begins to come into the fore in a godfatheresque fashion and the film ends with a perfect act of violence you would have expected a long time back. The second part of the film will be released in a couple of weeks and rest assured that those who have seen the first part will flock to see how this saga ends in what should be a definite cracker. To sum it up, don't go in expecting a master piece and you will thoroughly enjoy and even love the film. Special Mention: Try listening carefully to the songs playing in the background esp. Womaniya and Hunter – tunes which refuse to leave your head."
"Kashyap Brothers are the new Dabangg of Bollywood. This movie will win the Oscar in best foreign language film. This movie will be in the nominations this year. This is bigger and a lot better than Sholay. You can just play the dialogues and enjoy the movie. I have seen this 3 times and want to see it several times by now. As many times I see it I just feel Real and nothing Reel. Its so interesting. As many times I see it I feel that I have seen this character somewhere, I have met these people somewhere. The characters are just > Naam ke Musalman aur Fitrat se Insaan. None of the characters are good at all, they are all bad. But they are giving some core and basic truth about humans and their strength from wherever they do belong (U.P., Bihar, etc.) they are not less than anyone, and they are too connected to the soil.A lot better than Kahani, Ishqiya, Satya, Peepli Live, or any other this genre of movie. If you can portray so much reality in a movie, then the movie maker is really outstanding. Reality in looks, in language, in expressions, in problems and their solutions. Reality can be more felt when someone is really from these regions of the world. The kind of tension and awkwardness that is shown can be generally felt in these regions.""Chaabi Kahan Hai ? Gaand Mein Dali Hai Kya Chaabi, Sala Sab."" Khee Khee-Khee .. Hee-HeeMost importantly I liked the posters of the film. They are like I am seeing the covers of 80s and 90s Comics, Manoj Comics, Tulsi Comics etc.I am waiting for the sequel. ""Jia ho Bihar Ke Lala, Jiya Tu Hazar Sala. Tani Naachi Ke, ..."""
"I am a great movie buff, one of the greatest around. A great proclivity for cinema I have got. I have been a sincere fan of Martin Scorsese's works, all of them. I believe that a great director can put all the elements of greatness in a movie and make it reach the epitome of cinema. He can set fire to water if there is a natural demand for it. Not the actors, but the directors have always given cinema a turnaround whenever required.Now, this guy - Anurag Kashyap, is heavily influenced by Scorsese, and may be some other directors too. Being influenced and then delivering beyond imagination is a gargantuan task, only few blessed people can do. The film style and techniques which he carries with himself are rare, almost rare in the Bollywood where some quacks in the name of cinema produce utter rubbish stuffs and beguile the audience of real dimensions of cinema. Let's quickly talk about the movie. Every dimension of cinema has been given full respect. Everyone's performance is quite commendable. The cinematography is simply amazing. The dialogues are such a bliss to any Bihari ears. Thanks to the God, I have got a pair. A great music to spice up the situations. You know, the music will remind you of Kill Bill. Music has been Tarantino's one of the greatest weapons. Tarantino has also influenced Kashyap. The direction of the movie- let's not talk about that. I have talked a lot already about the director.One thing I want to mention particularly. Many directors tried to get into gang-wars, mafia and other stories involving Bihar and U.P. But the level to which this movie takes you has never been achieved earlier. I was just flabbergasted. How could the director boil down to such intricacies? That's the job of a genius, ain't it? There were few things I did not like about the movie. The movie needed a little bit more work on editing. The narrator should have been a better one. A powerful voice was what I thought lacked. Also if the movie were little bit peaceful in the first half, it would have been a legend. Remember Taxi Driver. That calmness and that peace. And one thing particularly- it should have been released in one piece despite of any length it had got. But bad things come in twos and here is Bollywood's baddie my friend.Do not listen to what one says. Just go for it. It will satisfy the voracious you. A perfect roller-coaster ride. And those who follow the quacks I mentioned - please avoid this movie. We do not want such slumps despising something heavenly.P.S.- Do not watch this movie with your girl otherwise you will end up answering the one and only question throughout the movie. ""What does that mean""?"
"GANGS OF WASSEYPUR, Part 1The flagship Indian feature seen this year at the Florence Indian film festival, ""The Gangs of Wasseypur"" is a Bollywood production in the sense that it was made in Hindi (rather than one of India's other 21 official languages) with professional Bombay performers and staff, but the content, style, and conception of this new opus seems to be pointing the Bombay film industry in a new direction. Wasseypur director, Anurag Kashyap, 40, is no newcomer to tinseltown having already helmed half a dozen features there since 2000 and acted as producer or writer on many more. Among his works until now are ""Black Friday"", 2007, which addresses the terrorist bombings in Bombay of 1993, ""Dev D"", 2009, a modern reworking of a semi-sacrosanct Indian screen classic, and ""The Girl in Yellow Boots"" 2011, which dissects the misadventures of a girl in the Mumbai sex massage trade, all hardball films of controversial content, one way or another. He also worked on the script of Ram Gopa Varma's unflinching study of the Mumbai underworld, ""Satya"" in 1998, which was deemed an Indian neo-film noir and is a kind of prequel to the current rural gangland saga. With ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" Anurag has pushed the Bollywood envelope about as far as it will go ...Wasseypur is a small town in the Dhanbad district of the god-forsaken state of Jharkhand, also known as the Coal Capital of India, and has been described as the most violent, lawless, and fearsome place in the entire land because of the endless gang warfare going on there for over half a century. The names of real life rival dons Sabir Alam and Fahim Khan, the actual warlords of two rival mafia clans, are indelibly associated with Wasseypur where the film is set, however, while the movie characters called 'Sardar Khan' and 'Ramadhir Singh' are theoretically fictional, it is pretty danged clear that any similarity to actual persons living and dead is far from coincidental. Anurag Kashyap, who has roots in Jharkhand knows the scene there only too well and is obviously not interested in glamorizing it or gilding any lilies. He wants people to wake up to reality, to put it mildly. .Gangs is a big hit all over India but, according to The Times of India, the initial showing in Wasseyput itself was called off for fear of violence.The direction Anurag explores in Wasseypur is a total departure from normal escapist Bollywood masala into the territory of stark black realism --""Reservoir Dogistan"" -- to borrow a page from the Cineblitz fan magazine satire of the picture. The Anurag analog of Tarantino's slicing off of an ear is the carving off an entire head from the body of a still squirming victim as fountains of rich red blood spurt up gloriously in a beautifully backlit set -- very cinematic if this kind of bloodletting is your cup of tea. It obviously was at Cannes where Gangs was declared a masterpiece, and maybe it is --but not for the faint of heart or the mushy sentimental Yashraj crowd. The language of the film is incidentally not exactly Hindi, but a regional variety known as Bhojpuri, which is actually Anurag's native tongue, and part of the reason that attracted him to this gory tale from the gritty Islamic coal pit belt of Jharkand province. The fact that most of the protagonists are Indian Moslems is more or less incidental, just one of the facts of life in this grisly manifresco -- Assalamu Aleikum.Another feature of this film is the utter obscenity of the language employed by the characters. The general flavor is conveyed by constant use of ""motherfucker, asshole"", and variations on these themes in the English subtitles, but the director assured me that much is lost in translation and that the original dialogues are far more varied and graphic -- which is apparently an important selling point in terms of shock therapy and linguistic titillation for the Indian public. A kind of documentary effect is created by the insertion of frequent dateline intertidal to help viewers keep track of events and set them up for the next assault on the senses. Actually these titles are necessary simply to keep track of who does what to whom, when and where, in this densely populated film where people keep getting knocked off every other minute and are almost interchangeable with the next corpse. Pehaps the whole thing is best summed up when one character says ""In Wasseyput even the pigeons fly with one wing because they need the other one to protect their ass"". Lots of catchy dialogues of this kind have made Gangs into an instant cult classic.There is also a lot of sex in the film but this is not a sexy picture. The main guy of Part I, Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai, the only previously well known actor in the cast) is an insatiable satyr and will screw anything that moves, merely to get his rocks off without the slightest trace of anything but rage. But don't worry -- he gets pumped full of hot lead at the Intermission (end of Part 1) with a bloody shot to the head to top it all off. An emerging new star, Nawaz Siddiqui (the relentlessly pot puffing son Faizal Khan), takes over in Part II and smokes more hash than the cocaine consumed by Al Pacino in Scarface '83 -- in fact, in terms of graphic violence and substance abuse these films are distant cousins. Or one might think, Sergio Leone with a twist of the knife in the gut and countless shots to the head. Well, the French have a name for it --""danse macabre"". A film not to miss, but make sure to check heart and mind at the door and abandon all hope Ye about to pass through the portals of your local Wasseypur show."
"In India the film will be released in two parts.Here I am reviewing the first part of the epic.With Smriti Irani gleefully welcoming the whole nation to Tulsi's family of ""Kyun ki saans bhi kabhi bahu thi""(famous Indian soap opera),the family setting is disrupted by a series of bang-bang thus setting the mood for a raw violent epic tale of deceit and revenge.Welcome to Anurag Kashyap's take on the violent gang-war of coal mafia in Bihar,the movie is one of rare docu-fiction made in India that has the signature mark of Kashyap–arguably the best Indian film maker of current generation.The movie runs for a span of six decades telling us the evolution of coal mafia to its pinnacle of violence. With Sahid Khan impersonating the legendary Sultana Daku starts looting the trains just prior to the Indian independence. With Shahid Khan being thrown away from the village in Dhanbad he started working in a coal mine from where the game of rivalry took its first step as Shahid Khan was betrayed and killed by Ramadhir Singh's henchmen and later on Shahid's son Sardar vowed to take revenge. The basic premise is simple about the age-old tale of son avenging the death of his father and how it all gets engulfed into a family rivalry with lies, treacheries and betrayals. The executions seem to be homage to Tarantino as the tale moves forward with its blood soaked screenplay.There is intelligent use of wit and one-liners which helps in building the proceedings. Rarely have we seen humor revolving around slaughtered bodies and body parts in desi films. As the movie spans over decades there is key eye for detailing which are reflected in every sequences. The usage of black and white footages increases the credibility of the docu-drama. Like Kashyap's previous films this also deals with the dark psychology of human. This time he chooses to unmask the violent reality ruling in the heart land of our country and ropes in enough humor to unleash the stark reality. For people of Wasseypur killing is like having lunch and that disturbing essence has been beautifully captured. The violent existence had injected hatred in the nerves of each individual. Syed Qadri should be applauded for having the courage to write the story. Being hailed from Wasseypur he even got life threatening calls for the story. Technically GOW is one of the best films of recent times and indeed shows reflection for the praises that are shown in various film festivals. Direction from Kashyap is unquestionably top-notch. Rajeev Ravi's camera makes the proceeding more real. Shot in real locations the camera and colors hops between reality and fiction playing with various colors. Sneha Khanwalkar's music is one of the real heroes of the film. Whenever the scenes were tending to get a little repetitive the music saves the scene. Sneha's music reflected the particular era. While ""Ik Bagal"" hits the right notes for 40s, ""Hunter"" is a effective modern day rendition of imagination of a person who is at ""high"".Without giving any spoilers I would say the sequence of ""Jiya ho Bihar ke lala"" and the way it has been shot in itself becomes a learning lesson for many budding film makers. Also without glorifying violence Kashyap seamlessly merges blood into the narrative and not for a single moment it looked gory.There is no space for melodrama or pseudo-morality. In fact he can give a lesson to mainstream film makers of effective use of action in a realistic yet entertaining fashion. I couldn't think of anyone except Manoj Bajpayee as Sardar Khan who has revenge in his mind but his weakness for female body costs him dearly. Richa Chadda as Nagma Khatoon excels in every scene.The rebellious wife of Sardar is probably the best written character in this film. Nagma is sensitive yet ferocious who has a clear thought process and her character symbolizes freedom otherwise absent in wives of male-dominated India.Tigmanshu Dhulia as Ramadheer Singh patronizes evil and he is a treat to watch.A superb director himself he showed that he is equally brilliant in front of the camera as well. After being part of several films Pankaj Tripathy really gets his due in a meaty role and he proved himself as Sultan Qureshi. The anger oozes out from his personality thus shaping the character.Piyush Mishra is as always effective and dependable.He speaks with his eyes and their lies the talent of the veteran.His lyrics here are as strong as the ones in Gulaal. . Reema Sen effective as Durga. Nawazuddin Siddiqui excels as Faizal Khan the younger and the rebellious son of Sardar Khan.He is there only in the last hour of the first part but one could gauge that he will dominate the second installment.His fiancé' débutant Huma Qureshi is gorgeous and spontaneous. Jaideep Ahlawat as Shahid Khan is superlative. He simply had the necessary energy to spark the proceedings in the initial hours.He steals the scene where his wife is about to deliver her child and yet he is caged in a coal mine following which he fights back with his master.It symbolizes the life we are leading at present when we are buried under burden of material existence and can't stand behind our beloved even in harsh times.There are many such sequences which work as metaphors to the degradation of the standard of life.Overall GOW-I is a epic masterpiece. Kashyap dares to go beyond the conventional means while telling an off-repeated story of revenge.In fact this film is a case study for film makers who can learn the art and use it to make something unconventional yet entertaining.As a film lover I am eagerly waiting for GOWII.P.S:The trailer of GOWII sets the mood with characters like Perpendicular,Definite,Tangent.The film looks to be more quirky than the first installment.One of the characters,a lean structure shown chewing a blade with an assassin look seem straight out of Tarantino films and my expectation increases manifold."
"Here it comes ..get set go . Boom boom boom kaboooom !! Welcome to other side of India, so rustic was the ambiance created that you wonder if it is the same India you belong to. I am going to take some time to absorb the stress. To be frank, I desperately need Yash Chopra's goody goody movie dose to clear my hangover.As with old Hollywood era, one side there were Tom Hank's feel good movies and other side were Clint Estwood's unadulterated Taxan flick. In Bollywood, we are coming up with good number of nail biting northern rural dramas (Can anyone forget Omkara or Ishqiya.. !). I personally believe these are much much better than latest trend of copying of southern OVER POWERED HERO's movies (does anyone needs Name?).When top notch direction meets with crunchy script a full blown entertainment is sure to be due. And Manoj Vajpai ..who?? (Yes yes yes fair enough.... I still remember Manoj Vajpai of Satya frame) is coming up at his own. There were others (still not able to get their names ), who were equally impressive. The only disappointment was editing, 20 minutes of cuts could have given GOW a Gem status. But yeah, may be that I can wish for part II. All in all, its treat to watch, if you like Spices more than Sugar ;-)."
one word for people who wonder why it rates above 8 on IMDb is - if you make films which are real they will hit the target. This movie is about real people REAL LANGUAGE real stupidity and at time real humor. It provides insight for everyone into rural lower and middle class who travel in local train and still go to Melas ! wear floral print shirts and have attitude to die for.watch it once and i can bet you want to travel in the cheapest class in Indian railways. To see how real it really is. meet the other 70 percent of India !!! Songs are straight from heart of rural India. Action will blow you away. comedy will keep you cracking every 10 minutes well orchestrated movie look forward to more of these. A real cult movie in Indian cinematic history.
"when it started ,, i was hooked and it kept me hooked till the story of shahid khan was going on,, the moment this chapter ended and sardar khan (son of shahid) grows up to seek revenge from Ramadhir singh for his fathers murder ,, the narration went haywire ...till the end of the film , the main plot of the film ""the revenge"" of sardar khan was missing ,, what did he do to ramadhir singh??? ,, how he managed or even tried to destroy him??? ,, was not there at all,, forget about it being unclear,,do you want me to believe that he avenged him by just slapping his son in front of a magistrate for which he was send to jail,, or just warning him by making a person dance on street on mithun's song,,,, sorry but there was no serious damage done to ramadhir singh,, or his image,, rather he(sardar khan) was quite happy flirting and making love to a woman he finds in wasseypur,, whether he wants to avenge ramadhir first or want to destroy Qureshi's first in wasseypur??? and if both then he must have worked twice as hard as he worked for it,,,,,,shahid khan kept volleying between two wives and trying to find a correct method to make guns and bombs,, all of this was funny to a point ,, but after a point it was just repeating itself and the hero and the plot were lost in all of this fun making ,,, and the film is not about a man who lost his way due to his own indulgence,, negligence and merry makingIts OK if this man wants to have fun ,, (surely he did and only did fun) ,, but what does he do the next morning ,, does he have a plan of action , does he has fire in his belly to avenge his father's murder??Mr. Anurag Kashyap...""Good fellas"" also had a lot of fun ,, but they also worked towards making money and keeping power,, one scene for each layering is enough,, to show that the gangster has a keep and visits brothels and is having a crisis at home with wife and has also indulged in coke , etc etc and shots of each plot can come and go,,, but the real tension lies in delivering goods next day at the job,, and then it is fun,,if the main characters vow is not important to him ,, why should i sit through it,, he was doing many things which were fun but all of these things were digression ,,, he himself was not committed towards his vow.... the movie has great scenes and all the performances are worth to see this movie ,, but good scenes don't make a good screenplay,,, if there are average scenes but when added together they say a clear focused story its better than good scenes back to back but going no where and not taking the story anywhereDirector chooses to titillate the audiences with colloquial nuances and banal flirtations and also some very regular but interesting abusive language,,, and all this peeping into the ""interesting"" ,""daredevil"", ego driven lives of these ruffians, only ends up in a very unidimensional view ,, which sadly restricts itself only to titillations and smart talk,,director chooses to say same thing in 2-3 scenes and sometimes has also underlined it by shot after shot repeating it,,so many plots ,, which were unnecessary,, and if they were necessary,,, as godfather has sunny and michael and other plots,,and for to make an Indian godfather the ""maker"" wants to adapt each one from ""Coppola's"" ,, these could have been done in a more concise manner The director wants to do lot of things together at the same given point,, hangover of scorsese,, Tarantino ,, and of course the thirst to make Godfather is very evident,, but those guys don't just shoot well,, but also have a story to say,, and however crazy their characters are ,,they have a line of action.. This has been a problem with Anurag Kashyap's movies,, he takes good plots , starts interestingly but ends up making indulgent movies,,and with this one he has gone twice more indulgent,, what could have been done in a 3 hour cut he is trying to do it in two parts ,,,,"
"So i gave this one a second shot. After not even an hour i had to give in again. The whole thing is extremely fast moving, there is absolutely zero character development and the story is going by like out of a machine gun, really hard to follow. And there really is a lot of characters, very confusing. Also lots of violence, screaming, you name it. For me who doesn't speak Hindi, reading the subs was also a real challenge as there is a LOT of speaking, not giving me a chance to even look at the picture itself. Maybe a movie made exclusively for the local audience. Don't get me wrong i usually enjoy Hindi movies, no problems with subs, this one gives me a real hard time though. I really tried..."
"I was first alerted of this movie by the sheer waves it was making in the Cannes Film Festival, and for the very obvious reason that it featured the hugely talented maverick director, Anurag Kashyap who had already carved a niche for himself by virtue of his brilliant direction in many unconventional, ""art"" films. The other reason was that one of my favourite actors, Manoj Bajpayee(one of those rare Indian actors who actually understand the meaning of acting), the genius who lived through his characters in films like Satya, Raajneeti, and 1971. Apart from these factors, what attracted me to the film was its gigantic ensemble cast(Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Tigmanshu Dhulia).I went to the theatre to catch part 1 without knowing what to expect, given Kashyap's penchant to making excellent films whose heady content are marked by ambiguous overtones; you never can really interpret any of Kashyap's films in one way!Ditto for Gangs of Wasseypur as well. I will not dwell on the plot, you will have to see the movie yourselves. What I will dwell on is the cinema itself. Firstly, to say that it is a violent movie is an understatement: there isn't just violence, you have men being butchered, gore splattered mercilessly. Hell, you even see a 10-second footage of blood on a floor(with a newspaper crumpled next to it, soaked in blood, just like how the policemen clean all the gore in crime scenes). Gunfire splits your eardrums, and believe me, it's a true-to-life sight.The movie begins with a rival gang blowing up a man's house with machine guns and makeshift bombs. The way Kashyap positions his camera and randomly puts in close-up shots of the machine guns followed by an overhead shot of the men firing at the doors of the house reminded me of those stalwarts of slickly violent films, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino. Kashyap's direction is not fast-paced by any means, it is indulgent, it is leisurely-paced and that gives enough room for character development, which is where Kashyap scores, big time. The citizens of Wasseypur are all fleshed out realistically, and the protagonist, a lecher who dreams of revenge and power is too true.Next up is the performances of the case which is nothing short of phenomenal. Manoj Bajpayee...well, well, not for once did I think that his Bhiku Mhatre would be overshadowed by any other character, but as Sardar Khan, the sadistic, scary and scheming Mafia lord and a lecher to boot, Bajpayee delivers a performance that is worthy of a National Award. Riccha Chaddha as Nagma Khatoon, Sardar's poor wife who has to put up with his frequent extra-marital affairs, is a veritable brimstone who spews abuses and threatens policemen with a sickle> She is arguably the find amongst new actresses in the Hindi film industry. However, the biggest surprise is the performance of Tigmanshu Dhulia as Ramadhir Singh. With restrained emotions and an intense body-language, Dhulia delivers a tour-de-force.What separates this film from the rest of the bullsh*t that the so-called ""Bollywood"" industry spews out, is its subtlety, a device that Kashyap uses to great effect. The scene where Sardar's uncle realizes Ramadhir Singh's plot of killing Shahid Khan(Sardar's father) by recognizing Singh's umbrella, is very effective, because it doesn't shove over-emphasis up your nose. Apart from that, the performances of the case, are not over-the-top, nor are they too wooden. They portray their characters realistically, and underplay them brilliantly, unlike some Srk's some Sallu's and some ""Big B's"" who don't even understand the meaning of the word subtlety. Bajpayee controls his problem of occasional hamming by restraining his emotions perfectly. Kashyap helps, too, with some tight screenplay, not allowing any character to wallow in their grief and breaking out into songs. Overall, 'Gangs...'is one of those movies that you have to watch, simply because it can easily lay claim with being one of the best movie in gangster genre along with City of God, Godfather trilogy, and Nayagan.PS: Watch the last scene of the movie, you will be astonished with Kashyap's black comedy."
"that is what the entire bollywood industry should do - bow to this movie. all these years bollywood has been churning out me too movies with fake western wannabe characters and music and dance and I practically stopped watching this cr@p every since I was around 16.GoW shows what real authentic Indian cinema can be, what it should have been - mind bogglingly rich in colors and smell and taste and overwhelming - just like India.I think this movie surpasses City of God in artistic value and screenplay. If Slumdog got an Oscar, this should get two. But then again, the Oscar committee may not quite appreciate what is essentially a very Indian backdrop. Actually to tell the truth - North Indian, more specifically Bihari, UP flavor.But who cares. The filmfare awards committee should take back all the FF awards given out till date and hand over to GoW. No hyperbole. This movie (should) redefines Indian cinema. Nevermind the average reviews of all the paid reviewers in Indian media. They are about as intelligent as the rest of the bollywood. This movie is AWESOME."
"Guns of Wassyepur.Bollywood very proudly flaunts badges like mindless entertainment, leave your brains behind comedy, potboiler, masala entertainer etc. The recent box office success of these films proves that there exists a larger population of people who step into the theatre to consume these films and most of them find it entertaining too.Gangs of Wasseypur is Anurag Kashyaps Take your brains with you masala potboiler film.On the surface it is a revenge drama spanning almost 70 years that starts between Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahalawat) and Ramadhir Singh (Played by two actors, the older part is played by Tigmanshu Dhulia) and is inherited by future generations of Shahid Khan.At a running time of 2 hrs 40 min the film is engaging and entertaining with not a single boring moment, that is if you find a connect with the characters and their world. They are crazy, eccentric, quirky and extremely violent without any remorse. The voice-over and the political information overwhelm you so much that it feels like you are sitting for an exam. You have to be so attentive especially in the first hour. Jaideep Ahalawat as Shahid Khan is the emotional anchor of the film. His track is the only time the revenge drama works which later fades away and I was watching it more as a madcap entertainer. Jaideeps fight sequence in the coal mines reminded me of Kaala Pathar. His intensity as an actor is terrific in whatever little he got to do. For me he is the find of the film.The world of Wasseypur is filled with strong women who speak their mind and don't take things lying down. Richa Chaddha, Reema Sen and Huma Qureshi deliver terrific performances. Every scene that had Richa Chaddha in it was my favorite. The last time I enjoyed Manoj Bajpayees performance was in Aks. This one beats it and is his 2nd best after Satya.Even though Tigmanshu Dhulia plays his part with silent menace his character comes across too weak to oppose the overpowering character of Shahid Khan which takes away some spice from the film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the lanky Faisal Khan is the Amitabh Bachchan of the 70s. In his eyes there are multitudes of emotions.If I sit down to write down moments that I enjoyed in the film I can fill pages mentioning it. If Anurag Kashyap has intended to make it as a masala entertainer against the backdrop of revenge he has definitely succeeded in making one but if his vision was to tell a revenge drama he falls flat on the face. I just didn't care for the revenge angle. Supporting his vision is the mind blowing music by Sneha Khanwilkar and the background music of G.V.Prakash. Both of them add funk to the violent and dark tone of the film. And to all those who worry about the duration of a film and say it is slow paced I would say that the duration of a film appears long only if it fails to engage you. An engaging film can never be too long. Gangs of Wassyepur didn't bore me for a second.Word of mouth Gangs of Wasseypur is Anurags tribute to the American gangster movies and Godfather and also his answer to the masala films of our times.Its an item film. Rating 3.5 (Good)Ticket Meter Worth 250 bucksP.S. pls stay right till the end to watch the trailer of GOW2."
"This movie gets a 6 from US viewers and a 5 from the top 1000 voters, yet somehow this mediocre--but for Bollywood standards great--movie is being put on an equal level to The Godfather by Indians who I assume are doing this to achieve some sort of pride in having their movie in the top 250. All you are doing is forcing IMDb to alter their algorithm and apply stricter standards (Rang De Bashanti, 3 idiots, like the stars in the sky and A Wednesday have recently removed from the list as a result of this changed algorithm), because of which great stuff like Harakiri isn't in the list. The only people you are fooling are yourselves, the rest of us are just frustrated."
"This is my first review of any movie.The Gang of Wasseypur movie is very well written and directed. Manoj Bajpai(Sardar Khan) acting is brilliant. This is a story of two Muslim communities i.e. Qureshi and Khan. After partition (separation of Pakistan and India), a coal mine was purchased by a Indian businessman named Tigmanshu Dhulia(Ramadhir Singh) from British Government. Ramadhir Singh hired a hit man to take care of his coal mine workers. Ramadhir Singh is a political person, he used different people to keep his influence in the Wasseypur village and he didn't mind to take someone's life, if he goes against him.I read somewhere in the previous review that the director Anurag Kashyap is the answer of Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino. I agreed with the person. Some scenes in this movie remembered me Quentin Tarantino's action flick Kill Bill.The Muslim events and festivals i.e. Eid, Marriages etc. are very well shown on the big screen.I rate this movie 8 out of 10."
"The splitting headache I got after watching this excruciatingly long movie was nothing compared to the one I'm currently having on seeing this feature film make IMDb's top 250. This movie relies on a few basic rules that make the majority of Indians go crazy but sadly, I don't see it. Reasons why my friends liked it: 1. Yaar it's cult. 2. That dialog about asking for hand-holding permission was killer. 3. That dialog about his wife asking him to eat well was so funny. 4. That song is epic! 5. Blah blah blah. The story is overly exaggerated (as claimed by some Wasseypur citizens themselves recently) so whoever says it's a REAL movie is welcome to take it up with them or me. It's painfully lengthy and slow. The last scene is too far from reality and only reminds me of Hrithik Roshan in Agneepath. The protagonist hates monogamy and loves sex, which makes Indian men whistle of course. Every second word in the movie is an abuse (again I hear whistles and even louder when the women are abusive). If this is all it takes to make a great movie, look out for my blockbuster tomorrow in a cinema-hall near you. Too many generations, too much of Godfather, excessive confusion, nymphomania, cheapness, vulgarity, abusiveness and gore. This movie was terrible. But please, see for yourself and I hope that some of you will agree with me after experiencing the above yourself. The rest of the GoW lovers, no offence, but your taste is pretty bad in my opinion."
"Staring the movie convincingly with a long shot of nicely coordinated action-thriller sequence, the movie then plunges into any and all Bollywood movie's recipe, especially those which aren't shot for the global audience. After the opening credits, it's all just non-stop and hyperbolic drama of cheesy quality, overly stocked with too much dramatization. The movie toys with viewers' level of tolerance by simply telling the story of the descendants of the first character. In a way, we'll all think that the story is more fitting for a two-season running TV series than an age long movie. Furthermore, the movie dazzles me with even more irony by having the ""to be continued"" tag line at the inconclusive ending. The acting overall is a standard over acted work of Indian movies, nothing else to say."
"GANGS OF WASSEYPUR also tries to walk on that thin line between the meaningful and entertaining cinema which in fact turns out to be a worth watching project due to its execution, performances, music and dialogues, but at the same time doesn't has anything fresh to offer in terms of concept, storyline or script. Following the path already discovered in Hindi Cinema by Ram Gopal Varma in his Rakt Charitra Part 1 & Part 2 releasing in the gap of two months, Anurag decides to go the same way with his GOW Part 1 & 2. But for some undisclosed reasons he doesn't mention this two part film in GOW's posters or promotion as was boldly done by RGV. Anurag's films have always been region based projects featuring subjects revolving around cities like Mumbai, Rajasthan, Punjab and more. So following the same trend, this time he takes us to a rather lesser known region of Wasseypur (Dhanbad) and its coal mine industry dealing in gang wars. The film gives you no time to settle down and simply starts off with a long bloody sequence of guns, murders and bloodshed. But then it takes too much time of almost 40 minutes to tell you the background of the story and the lead actors enter the screen only after this initial hiccup. The first half mainly deals with defining the basis of all the rivalry going on with small references of the Coal-mining history starting from the British era. Thankfully, the director comes into his form post intermission and gives you many more striking sequences which are surely not for the faint hearted. There are more brutal murders and the deadly gang wars continue till the next generation which somehow also gives you a feeling of being repetitive. Further, the length of close to 3 hours leads to a little restlessness as it moves towards the climax. But 3 things truly save the film despite of having all the routine content as far as the storyline is concerned.First being the execution/direction, including the way it has been brilliantly shot making you feel the rustic ambiance of the locations. Particularly the second half which has more happening on the screen as compared to the first. The writing is noteworthy with dialogues written exactly in the way they are spoken in such remote areas with all those cuss words. Second are the performances by the entire cast excelling their own previous acts undoubtedly. Lead from the front by Manoj Bajpayee, GOW would not have been possible without him for sure. The actor plays his role with such ease and conviction that you are bound to ask that from where he actually belongs from. Along with Manoj stands tall, a surprisingly competent performance from the director of PAAN SINGH TOMAR, Tigmanshu Dhulia, who is truly mesmerizing. With his superb act he clearly reveals the secret that why all the actors always come out with such great award winning performances in his directed movies. That's because he himself knows the art so well. Completing the trio is Piyush Mishra, who once again reminds the industry the power house of talent within himself of being an actor, writer, lyricist, singer and composer. In the supporting cast, Jaideep Ahlawat, Jameel Khan, Pankaj Tripathi, Vipin Sharma & Yashpal Sharma (in a cameo) are really great sinking deep into their respective characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui gets into the limelight towards the climax and looks like he is going to be the surprise package of GOW-II (as shown in the trailer). In the female lead, there is another power packed performance from Richa Chadda, who is still remembered as the OYE LUCKY LUCKY OYE girl. But after this movie, she is sure going to be called as GANGS OF WASSEYPUR girl. Reema Sen superbly provides the much needed subtle, sensuality to the project and so does Huma Qureshi who has a much meatier role in Part II. Last but not the least comes the Soundtrack of the film by the extremely talented Sneha Khanwalkar which exactly provides the director what he needed to enhance the overall impact of the film on the viewers. The songs are earthy & folk mixed with the modern arrangement and even sung by the local singers which perfectly suit the mood of the film. Anurag intelligently uses the tracks merged in the background score which neither hinders the pace nor work as an obstacle to his narration.So, GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is sure going to get rave reviews from all corners. But whether the same would be the result on the Box Office or not remains dicey. The film is no doubt exceptional in the way it is presented, enacted and executed. Still its overall theme remains the routine with nothing new to offer to the common viewer and there are too many characters thrown in by the director in his narrative. Hence, it is immensely watchable for everyone interested in something exceptional tried on the screen but at the same time, it also doesn't have any surprises or twists and turns in its cliché story content. So, once again the choice is all yours after reading all the energetic write-ups on the film written all over the media."
"It's a gangster film, in a time when gangster films have been done to death. In order to create one that is truly good and stands out from the rest, you must start off with a good initial idea. This film lacks that idea, and creates an extremely generic, clichéd crime film that more than certainly over stays it's welcome. This movie took me two days to watch, and throughout I was wondering if it was possible to get any more boring. 320 minutes of hacking off limbs, weird music scores in the middle of a scene and nonintellectual dialogue just ruin what could have been an epic if they could have pulled off such a runtime.Ultimately Gangs Of Wasseypur fails on a grand scale. Nothing in this film is remotely interesting, the film takes too long to end (hence it takes too long for anything meaningful to happen) and the direction, acting and script almost make it the worst I've seen. I would give it an 'F', but I don't think it is deserving of that."
"This is a fascinating film. There are innumerable characters who you might easily forget between two scenes, but like with the legendary ""McGuffins"", you can subsist without knowing everything about every character. The story is set in, and is about, Bihar. The language is coarse, but beautiful, as the dialects from up there are. Manoj Bajpai is Sardar Khan who has revenge on his mind. Or so he says, for he takes a longer time ogling at women and impregnating them. If this role were an ocean, he dives into it headlong. If it were bread, he bites into it. No coincidence that his best remembered turn before now was as Bhiku Mhatre in Satya, which too was written by Anurag Kashyap. The setting is young India of the 40s, which grows into an indifferent one of the 2000s. Wasseypur is the cauldron of corruption, violence and disrespect. It is also very colourful. Richa Chadda as Naghma, Sardar Khan's wife is excellent. She gets all the great lines and she thrives on them. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the most exciting acting talent since Irfan Khan, is the Michael Corleone to Sardar Khan's Don Corleone. He gets very few screen space, but with the promise that the next part of this epic will have him in a key role. If the music and the pace of the film can be kept so, Gangs of Wasseypur 2 is one you would check your local listings for every day."
"Firstly lets talk about performances every actor/actress lived their roles did 100% justification and cinematography is very natural brings us a realistic feeling while watching, music is good, an intriguing & subtle writing executed outstandingly!
This film deals with all the illegal mob businesses, vengeance & celebrations. What I like in Mr. Anurag's narrative is he just puts heavy emotions with very ease on screen but they were deep as well. I bloody fu**kin' recommend this movie for every movie buff out there."
"Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1 has a winsome quality about  it which makes it effortlessly and addictively watchable. The episodic  nature of the film makes it not very different from a soap saga, and  its director Anurag Kashyap perhaps realized this point during filming.  That why his film begins with the opening credits of Kyunki Saas Bhi  Kabhi Bahu Thi (Because a Mother-in-Law was once a daughter-in-law), a  hugely popular television serial that aired in the 00s about three or  four generations of a family living under one roof. Fortunately, Gangs  of Wasseypur has none of the overbearing melodrama which Indian soap  operas have; the film is all about gangsters, guns, gore, gaalis (  profanity) and revenge. Also about making many babies, which is maybe  when the film comes closest to a television soap.  This film, combined with its sequel, would have been a fantastic four-  part television miniseries, but Kashyap chooses to divide his five-and-  half hour magnum opus into two feature films, giving them both  theatrical releases. This is perhaps why I thought Gangs of Wasseypur  Part 1 was like a tome without any major turning points to translate it  well to silver screen. The film plays out like missions from the latest  Grand Theft Auto games but unlike the video-game, it doesn't let us  have our breaks when we need some. A guy I knew was a speed-reader who  could finish a tome in one sitting; to watch Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1,  maybe one needs to be a 'speed-viewer' to take in the film in its  entirety. The film is made up of too many expositions that extend right  up to the very end, and there are times when you feel as though your  hard-drive is being loaded with much more information than your storage  capacity. The major turning-point in the film for me came only with  Nawazzudin Siddique's entry, which happens way later in the film; until  the flurry of excellently written, well-acted and impeccably  choreographed scenes did impress me but I found myself a little lost  and confused about where the film was going.   Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1 covers six decades, beginning in the forties  where our narrator Nasir tells us about the history of Wasseypur, a  region located in Dhanbad in the state of Jharkhand. The place is  dominated by Sunni Muslims, with the Quereshi sub-caste of animal  butchers being the most feared in the area. We learn that the British  trains passing through the region were robbed by dacoits, mostly the  Quereshi Muslims led by Sultana Quereshi. When word spreads in town  that someone is impersonating Sultana to rob trains using his name, the  Quereshi Muslims suspect Shahid Khan after they find his business  flourish suddenly. One night, as Shahid Khan's men plan to rob another  train, the Quereshis attack them and slaughter everyone except Shahid  and our narrator Nasir.  The two men are banished after this incident and Shahid finds work at a  coal mine. His pregnant wife dies in childbirth leaving him with a son  and Shahid later kills the muscle-man at work who refused him leave the  day his wife died. He is later hired as the new muscle-man at the coal  mine by Ramadhir Singh, an industrialist entrusted with a few  coal-mines after the British Raj. Their alliance develops until Singh  overhears Khan's plans to kill him in future; Khan is later shot to  death by Mr. Yadav, a supplier of ammunitions, under Singh's order.  However, his son Sardar escapes along with Nasir which leads to a  twenty-year jump in the story. Sardar Khan, now a grown man, vows to  avenge his father's death and slowly gains control of Wasseypur. His  foe Ramadhir is now a shamelessly corrupt politician who forms an  alliance with Sultan, a feared butcher in Wasseypur belonging to the  same Quereshis who banished Shahid Khan, to stop Sardar from extracting  revenge.   What is interesting about the cinematography in Gangs of Wasseypur is  that the film does not have many close-ups and when it does, it's for  undoubtedly the best scenes in the film. Consider the scene in which  Ramadhir Singh summons Quereshi to confront him about having lied about  killing the young Sardar. We first have a static shot with Ramadhir  towards the left of the screen, and Quereshi entering through the door  on the right and sitting down, taking a quick look at Ramadhir's office  like guests do usually. Then it cuts to middle shots (covering head to  torso) of Ramadhir and Quereshi as Ramadhir asks him whether he  remembers Shahid Khan. After this, the camera goes for close-ups of  their faces as Singh talks about having seen the 'ghost' of Shahid's  son and requests Quereshi to dig out the bones of the 'dead' kid as  they have to be used for a ritual to drive the ghost away. Quereshi  nods uneasily and the camera pauses on his face for a second before he  is slapped by Ramadhir. The rest of the time, Anurag Kashyap allows  Rajeev Ravi the cinematographer to capture the panorama of Wasseypur,  with outdoor scenes being interspersed with shots of onlookers and  evocative sceneries such as the idle lake at dawn or the mining sites.  The unconventional music and narration seamlessly stitch together the  various scenes taking place over six decades, and lighting works  fantastically especially during the shooting sequences taking place at  night where the street-lights act as the only source of illumination.  Despite all the praise I've given, I still feel Gangs of Wasseypur,  because of its episodic nature, would work better as a television  miniseries. On the silver screen, the saga feels stretched and you feel  a tad stressed."
"I am not sure of why this movie was added to my watch-list, somehow done and found and watched it. What a waste of time. To me, this is one of the most overrated movies ever. But, at the same time I don't want to be ignorant to the people who this movie historically (or fantastically) about, may be it contains deep emphasis or aspects which a foreigner like me can't infer.Why? It is a very long movie, add a slow pace to it and finally get a tantalizing experience. This orphan boy was keen to revenge in a scene while having hug from his woman, on to kill the murderer of his heroic father, and then, somehow lost focus. First fought for the rights of mine against him, then insulted him, then jailed, then escaped. Later went into a political rival against ""him"". Come on! You should respect to your father's memory and take revenge... Nope.Passed the scenes, especially nonsense ones, rapidly.Finally, don't waste your time."
"Every Human being on the earth has different shades/dimensions within themselves. Good, bad, sensitive, insensitive, fear, bravery, jealousy, courtesy, and the list is endless. Unfortunately, majority of the movies we see portray the characters as having only one dimension. And typically Indian Cinema is narrower in this aspect. From Indian cinema perspective there are only ""good"" and ""bad"" characters. Anurag Kashyap, is one of the handful directors, who stick to the fact that, there is nothing like good and bad. It is all about CHARACTERS!!!and each character WILL have multiple dimensions within himself/herself.KUDOS to the amazingly talented path-breaking director of Indian Cinema, Mr. Anurag Kashyap for giving such an epic movie called ""Gangs of Wasseypur"". Watching this movie is a bliss for a cinema lover. No wonder, it was hugely appreciated at the Cannes Film Festival.GOW is an end-product of a the most impressive story-telling, dialogs, characterizations, background music,casting and all other crafts in film-making!! Every character and the scene is written so wonderfully that, you are glued to the seat throughout the 160 minutes, forget the whole world, and feel as if you are there in the movie and seeing the characters live in front of you.Of course, it is not for the weak-hearted, as it has brutal violence, which is essential to get the right impact of the severity of the events. There are umpteen number of characters in the movie, and each of them have performed first-rate. They are not glamorous, they appear real. Not just that, the emotions the characters portray, are real, including the abusive language. (yes, indeed they are used in real life). Though the movie, has a native backdrop(Bihar), the theme is universal- REVENGE.What I liked: (I liked every part of the movie, but would like to mention some extra-extra-ordinary things)Manoj Bajpayee's screen presence, is FABULOUS!!Straight-forward, Bihar-accent-ed powerful dialogs (I felt that aha, I wish I was a Bihari for these 3 hours, to enjoy the dialogs more heart-fully)Timing of the songs and background music and the variation of these music pieces, elevate the movie to the next level.What I did not like: Nothing!!Summary: DO NOT MISS!!!Note: The movie ends at a critical point, and also lays the foundation for the sequel- ""Gangs of Wasseypur-2"", which will hit the screens soon, and I just cant wait to watch that. As per my assumption, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, will be having a major role in the sequence. Nawazuddin, is one of the finest actors, we have. (Recently, you watched him in New York,Kahaani and Paan Singh Tomar. FYI, he will also be playing a major role in Aaamir Khan's Talaash.)"
"It should be borne in mind that this movie is not like any other B-flick, the movie seems to be revolving around the tussle between the gangs of dhanbad(part of bihar), brilliant acting by all the characters,excellent dialogue deliveries... needless to say the hero of the film is ANURAG KASHYAP,reason being his marvellous direction and concept.. big fan!!!! he is turning out to be the QUENTIN Tarantino of the bollywood, the people who have appreciated his(ANURAG KASHYAP) previous work are definitely going to eulogise this movie also.. star cast has been amazing,manoj vajpayee has always been one of the most talented actor when it comes to act as a gangster and has proved the same in this movie!!! VERY UNIQUE AND FOXY MUSIC!!!! CAMERA WORK AND PRESENTATION ARE TOP NOTCH!!!"
"One of the worst films I've ever nearly sat through. Can't believe it's Anurag Kashyap's film!I am seriously wondering how is this averaging 8.6 out of 10 on IMDb? Seriously? I feel sorry for people who can't see through the filth...When the movie started it looked like it's going to be a neat documentary-like film about that region of India, but within few minutes it started getting little strange as the plot and storyline kept getting more and more inconsistent and boring. I should mention that I generally like Anurag Kashyap's films. Until now I used to look forward to his films. After seeing this move I would be careful.I don't want to put any spoiler in this review, you should watch it and decide for yourself."
"if i knew before that this is what i am gonna get in the next two and a half hour i would have never wasted my time watching this film!seriously besides some nice acting by Manoj Bajpai, there is nothing left to see in this film. they just pulled the film without any reason. lots of characters. always got confused between who's who? there's no specific target in this film. in most cases they just jumped from one scene to another. ending is a total crap. i had a huge expectation from this film but got total disappointment. i also do regret a lot to suggest this film to my friends even before i watched this film.so please guys save your time to see some other staff, but don't see this one."
"The characters in the movie are complete degenerates. This movie is much like Rakth Charitra series by RGV, except this one is too long for no particular reason and none of the characters generate any sympathy, they are all evil immoral degenerates (like Bukka from Rakth Charitra). Heck, even the lead women characters are conniving manipulators. Abusive language is pervasive throughout the movie, more for shock value than anything else. What is the point of revenge back and forth over and over again? This could have been a good 2 hour movie. At the end, it did not matter to me if a Khan wins or Singh wins the battle of revenge. It does not matter, they are all thugs. The only redeeming quality is the awesome performance by Bajpai, Siddique, and Chadda. Piyush Mishra and Yashpal Sharma were wasted, they should have had more prominent roles, they are perfect for this genre. Music and background scores are forgettable. Watch for performances and shock-value, nothing else."
"Watched ""GANGS OF WASSEYPUR"". Movie is good. One time watchable. Starting is slow but after some time it catches the pace. Audiences were hard-core serious film lovers but they were enjoying the love scenes most. Yeah, love scenes are literally very entertaining and innovative. There were only eleven females among 160 audiences. Dialogues are THETH Bihari but enjoyable. Music score is also good especially the Womania...Music has the sweet taste of local folk. Manoj Bajpaye is awesome. One actress as Nagma Khatoon impresses. Rest actors are also good. Actually, casting is perfect. The ambiance, music, casting create the feel that it is real Wassyepur. At the climax the behavior of Durga is not justified. The exaggerated shooting scene at the very beginning of film seems imposed, it was not real, just an attempt to surprise the audience. Overall, movie will not disappoint the audience. It is a complete PAISA VASOOL."
"A film desperately in need of an editor...A story spanning several decades, condensed into 320 minutes (!). Set in the city of Wasseypur, India, two rival factions have been fighting each other for many years. We see how the feud began, and how it developed...Boring and, at 320 minutes, seemingly interminable to the point of being painful. Based on the story outline, the movie had potential: a gangster movie spanning several decades - quite Godfather or Goodfellas-like. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Incredibly unfocused with pointless detours and sub-plots. Pretty much just drifts for all those 320 minutes.A bit (actually, a lot) of editing, and much more focusing on the main plot and the movie could have been interesting.On the plus side, the usual Bollywood nonsense of random song-and- dance scenes is kept to a minimum. In fact, no dancing, just singing. The small amount of musical interludes is also a negative in a way. When I saw how long the movie was I figured it was because it had the usual song-and-dance stuff, and I would just fast forward through that. Alas, no such luck."
"This movie was pathetic. If IMDb allows me, i would rate it 0/10. So many vulgar dialogs which makes no sense at all which includes the movie soundtrack as well and it was totally unnecessary. I guess that is the attraction for many viewers. Manoj Bajpai acted well and the direction was good but the way the story was presented was disgusting. The movie has been added with too much Mirch Masala and the worst part about it was the crowd in the theaters. Due to some sensitive issues, people were fighting in the cinema halls itself. The movie can't be seen as an entertainment flick. Really disappointed with the overall hype about it."
"This blast will echo for decades & be heard by people across the globe. This is why I watch movies, every once in a while I stumble upon such a masterpiece which moves me to tears. You would feel emotionally drained as if rug had been pulled from under your feet & will take you by surprise. Had it not been a bollywood production this masterpiece would've been in IMDb top 10. Probably the best & most important film from bollywood/Hollywood put together. This film will make anyone think hard about how not to take things for granted and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. The music is worthy of praise too, the raw emotion and feeling is amply conveyed.A few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement of this film & I felt compelled to write a review soon after watching it. After some persuasion from friends I finally got to see it & have been recommending to others ever since. When it comes to movies I'am quite picky & very hard to please guy. There have been occasions where I have literally walked out of the theatre & times where I felt like I have wasted my time. I often watch movies on solid recommendations & tend to follow certain directors & cast. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is. It is a moving film which will shake you from inside. A real must-see. Amazing story brilliant performances.Very rarely it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeal this fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. Enough good things can't be said about this movie. It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made. One of the most memorable and wonderful movies of the century. I can't say enough good things about this film I really can't - I mean it. Its one of my personal top ten films of all time. There is not another film more deserving of solid 10/10 in the list than Gangs of Wasseypur. Thank you so so much Mr Anurag Kashyap for having wonderfully put together this incredible masterpiece."
"this movie became my favorite before i watched it.........not only because of anurag sir......or its success at cannes film festival or manoj bajpayee but because of its promos.......i went to theater and came out with same happiness as i expected from anurag kashyap's movie......in India majority says that the movie is boring and not good but i don't agree with them because those are the people who liked worst movies like housefull 1/2,bodyguard,dabangg,wanted etc.. and ignored movies like shanghai,black Friday,gulaal, etc.. I am warning people out there that if You like non sense action like bodyguard or some baseless movie sorry sir/ma'am this movie isn't made for you....according to me this movie is 1 of the best movie of bollywood till date....anurag gave so much attention to the detailing that you can't just ignore it and every character has given life it's own time to breath.......performance of all actors are awesome and manoj bajpayee is at all time best.....the plot,the story is larger than life and as you all know that this story is based on true story....some people will get shocked after watching this movie that this is the same country that they belong to.....this movie is not made for people who thinks that real India is shown just in 'yash raj films'..............for me its the best film ever made"
"ALL 10 STARS!!!! This movie does not shy away from anything. It is bold and full of rage (as the title says it) with hint of subtle laughter after every 5mins. The music will take you to another level in every situation. Based on true incidents in the coal belt of India, this movie will show you the truth behind news and claims of our political leaders. It will show you the horror in which people lived during past 60 years in Dhanbad area. Go for awesome acting, music and thrill. Overall, a different and unexpected experience.PS: For the people in India who feel that taking kids to a R-rated movie is OK for their 'early education', this movie will show you why you should never do that. Grow up and let the kids grow up properly too."
"It would suffice to say that Gangs of Wasseypur is a film which is in a class of its own by such a far distance from its peers from the same house, that, by the sheer fact of its existence, it manages to add a chapter to the history of that very house.However, as someone from that very land, it is difficult to stop here without rambling a bit about its beauty and force. The place of Gangs of Wasseypur and its impact on Indian cinema and filmmaking in India can only be judged fairly as time passes. However, in its content and style, Gangs of Wasseypur seems to have been cut from an entirely different cloth, of a class much superior.Gangs of Wasseypur was released theatrically in two parts. But, for all purposes, it may be considered a single film, despite the somewhat different flow of the two parts. Delving deep into the plot (which is by no means drab) isn't of much use as Gangs of Wasseypur is not about the plot, it is about the treatment. Gangs of Wasseypur is not nearly as much about the story as the storytelling. A revenge saga with political, criminal and romantic themes intertwining – the tale is gripping. But what raises Gangs of Wasseypur into the level of extraordinary is the glaring realism, brought to life by powerful performances and crisp presentation. Anurag Kashyap's talent has been on display before, but perhaps never as grandly as here. He tells the story of the lives of his commonplace protagonists in an unusual place and circumstances and is aided by an excellent soundtrack, which draws upon an array of sources and styles. Sneha Khanwalkar's soundtrack is an overflow of both creativity and hard work, and both show aplenty in the excellent output that bursts forth.Veterans like Manoj Bajpayee and Piyush Mishra are classy as expected, but the performances from relative unknowns are the icing on the cake. A special mention must be made of Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The emergence of Nawazuddin in a lead role in a mainstream film is in itself a remarkable fact in the annals of ""Bollywood"", for reasons unnecessary to explain. His screen presence, dialogue delivery and expressions are phenomenal and encourages in one the audacity of hoping – hoping for many more of such powerhouse performances in the years to come.The character building is magnificent, which lets one flow with the story without any jarring effects. The second part does tend to overflow with the number of characters at times, but the distinct flavour of each new element and the twists introduced thereby make it worth the trouble of tracking the complex plot.The only adverse criticism which can be made about Gangs of Wasseypur is that certain themes and parts of the film are 'inspired' by legendary mafia Classics though it must be said in the same breath that the 'adaptations' have been made with great skill and care, rendering the story a life and charm distinctly of its own. Gangs of Wasseypur's relationship with the Hindi film industry is multi-layered. On one level, it awes some of Gangs of Wasseypur's major protagonists. On another level, it is mocked. And therein lies the ultimate accomplishment of this great film. Just as evolution is about improving upon and refining what you inherited to leave behind something superior, Gangs of Wasseypur evolves from the land of Bollywood which it is born into and goes one, or maybe two, steps further."
"Gangs of Wasseypur is a story of three generations seeking revenge, each putting it: ""Hamari zindgi ka ek ea maksad hai-- Badla"". The first is a laborer who is fighting to establish his empire; his son was born to avenge his father's murder, and the third generation child who accidentally discovers sexual relationship of his mother and his grandfather (father's brother). The movie starts with the political rape of a city map and ends at rape of human trust for egoistic satisfactions. The songs like ""Ik bagel Mei Chaand hoga"" and ""Keh K loonga"" are the soul of the movie. For this I should write a special note on Sneha Khanwalker and her team. But I avoid writing on her as I fear falling in Love with her. I don't know what for you is the importance of ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" but for me it is the story of that small kid whose honest father is brutally killed in the garden when he was teaching his son that flowers should not be killed. It is also about that child who is continuously crying when just outside his father is celebrating after killing someone. A bit about that butcher's child on whom camera stops for a second when Sardar khan is burning and bombing his home.For me the film has stuck in that Coal mine where your skin will be ripped off if you work a minute less than 12 hours, where there is no light or oxygen and there is a face of a man who wants to turn cruel forever, beat his own people, burn their houses and gain power. And on death he wants to leave his son in that fire where he will grow his hairs only after taking the revenge of his father's death. Oops!! He will not take the revenge, He will rip him dry (Keh K lega uski).How many films are there which show the history, geography and present of Coal Maafia. Which show children bringing stolen iron from the same streets where an Icecream cart is going along? How many films will point out that Tata, Birla and Thapar got everything for Peanuts. And that Britishers used to provide salary and shelter whereas the Indian Govt provides only salaries that too after breaking the shelter. How many films will stop at the face of the person burning houses and show his dilemma and guilt. That is why, ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" might have a lot of abuses and gunshots, a lot of people and buffaloes getting butchered off, but it is the Real story of our internal layers. A pinch of Wasseypur is within all of us. Those are our own homes where a wife in a hushed voice asks her husband, who is planning a murder, whether to serve food in Bone China dishes because the guest is a Muslim. They are our own fathers who might be killing the whole world outside but they get panic attacks when their sons get a little wound. This is our life and its multiple characters, violence of our own world and Slaughter-Houses where an Eye for an Eye is making the whole world blind. This movie is not important for its story but for its characters and their reactions to various circumstances. It is so natural that people stop back to collect their slippers which are left back while running after committing a murder and loot. The movie stops again and again on kids watching all this and warns us that they will turn up doing the same when they grow up. The movie rises above the bar to establish the reality of its characters, their lives, their streets and city. Somewhere with the posters of ""Kasam paida Karney wale Ki"" ""Coolie"" ""Guide"" and sometimes with the charismatic happiness of first time seeing a revolver, someone with a dream of Automatic Guns and somewhere with the luxury of a new Fridge in the home, the movie walks you through the real evolution of India. You might confuse it with a normal story of vengeance, but this movie is different because it gets cooked in the kitchens of gangsters, walks in their terrace, eats Chaat with them, drink Lassie, and the movie sits with the gangster when they are watching their girlfriend washing clothes at a hand pump. The movie is shy when they touch the hand of a girl for the first time, sings in their marriages and it laughs when their hands receive shocks while firing from a country made revolver. Ranging from theft of Icecream to Coal, Fish, Ponds, Petrol and money, this movie shows you all the loot happening in our country.In train, railway lines, lodges, hotels, on road, in the mourning of Moharram and on Ghats of Banaras, Anurag Kashyap takes the movie with so ease that you feel that Manoj Vajpayee is taking a revenge for you. The movie takes you back to the homeland of India. An even when Sardar Khan falls after getting shot, he doesn't gets an Ambulance, Car or bike but a Rickshaw whose owner name is written as Jaiswal Building Material. He has to fall on it, rickshaw has to move on and vanish. The same rickshaw which is been driven by many Sardar Khan's everywhere in India. But these Sardar Khan's don't have own a piece of land anywhere in this country.It is a movie where every character or object has to take a stand, and prove the reason of its being. It is neither about Revenge nor about Wasseypur. It is about that Violence in which many of our generations and races have got wasted. It is about the Faizals who are forced to leave school, clean the toilets of Trains and then resort to drugs and looting. The movie laughs at that violence, it laughs on everyone, on us."
"The most important thing for a movie depicting real life events is the characterization. Every character has to fit in to the role he/she is given and kudos to Mr. Anurag Kashyap, he has done exactly as prescribed. The best part about the movie is that it's action and the dark comedy never seemed unreal. The flow of the movie seemed perfect for a blend of action and reality. Acting was just perfect with every actor doing justice to his/her role. Screenplay was gripping with straightforward dialogues and good characterization. The film never seemed to aberrate from its central theme.One of the most creative things about the movie was the old book styled beginning. It made the movie look more contemporary to its setting. One huge relief about the movie was that the music was well chosen and well timed. The cinematography was also perfect. The setting of the movie looked very real. Bihar/Jharkhand/Uttar Pradesh, thanks to their governance in last 15 years, have not changed much and that helped a lot to this cause.The only negative part about the movie is its language and some gory scenes nevertheless these were inevitable. A movie not advisable to sensitive viewership. A few families were seen leaving the movie theater midway after it got too much for them. Overall the movie is a good watch for them who could take these negatives as a part and parcel of the movie without which it could not have been as good as it is and a value for your money."
"The plot is an unbelievable revenge story that spans across decades in Wasseypur and Dhanbad. Though the Part 1 of this movie lacks punch and more of the lifestyle of Sardar Khan, Part 2 is absolutely brilliant and keeps you hooked. The violent and gory scenes makes you go awe and gives a shock value. Special credits for the Music department for giving songs that blends within the culture of Bihar and rural outskirts. I hardly doubt anyone other than Anurag Kashyap can pull off such a remarkable gangster story spanning generations across 3 families!! Absolutely brilliant film thats worth watching!!"
"The first half of the violent epic is as brutal and frenetic as it is engrossing and entertaining.
The second half is justa s energetic and well directed, yet darker and more violent, sometimes to a disturbing level.
Overall, Gangs of Wasseypur is a 5 hour epic that's never boring. Beautifully shot and directed, fantastically edited and one of the best gangster movies I've seen."
"The best indian gangster movie you ever seen
Acting is best
Directions best
Song best
All are perfect
The cinema we want"
The movie is too episodic in a way that betrays a motivation of showing India off rather than telling the world what is. Individual acting performance of Tigmanshu Dhulia is what keeps you in semi-awe given the loose ends at screenplay that pervade all within. Best Method Acting by an Indian Actor after Sivaji Ganesan's mega cameo in Thevar Magan.
I am not a big fan of Bollywood but this movie is a gem. It's so original and realistic. The best thing about the movie is Manoj Bajpaye and Nawaz ud din Siddiqi.
"This is the first time I enjoyed watching a hindi movie so much. The direction, script, and acting was breathtaking."
"I've always heard praise for the Gangs of Wasseypur duology but never got around to actually watching them. But now that I've seen both of the parts, I think it's safe to say that it's one of the better gangster films (or in general) I've seen in a WHILE, especially from India.
The story is a gigantic mess, but in a good way. There are uncountable characters, each with his/her own motivations, living in a small world where the notion 'the survival of the fittest' reigns supreme. One might get lost in this giant maze but trust me, it all ties in together perfectly.
The plot and storyline in the 2 parts are quite different but are connected in regards to the subject matter. Part 1 deals with Shahid Khan, his exploits, his alliance and subsequent murder at the hands of Ramadhir Singh. His son, Sardar Khan, his own thirst for vengeance and assassination are also explored. The latter lays the foundation for the Part 2, which deals with the repercussions of Sardar's death on Wasseypur and the neighbourhood in an increasingly tense and politically-charged climate. Sardar's son, Faizal Khan, along with a bunch of new characters, is introduced in the second part.
Both of the parts are adroitly written and combine the traditionality of Western gangster films with Indian eccentricity. The scenes are quirky and clever, traits which have become hallmarks of Anurag Kashyap, who has managed to direct films of such lengthy runtimes without either of them feeling like a slog. (Part 1&2 are both 2hr 30mins+)
This proficiency can be attributed in part to the PHENOMENAL acting. If I'm not hyperbolic enough already, I will go on and say that much of the cast gave their career-best performances. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Manoj Bajpai, Richa Chadha, Jaideep Akhlawat all were stellar. Pankaj Tripathi and Rajkummar Rao were great early-bets and in retrospect, it's not surprising to see how well they acted even in the relative infancy of their careers. Definite highlights, even though Rajkummar has a somewhat insignificant but unforgettable role.
Besides that, the cinematography and camerawork are really on-point. The cinematography complements the storyline in a great way, matching the quirky-ness and off-kilter humour of the script. Shots are easy-to-follow but never complacent. They're engaging and portray the tone the films are aiming for perfectly. The cinematography is atmospheric and embodies the rural environment with all its nuances. The gunpowder and cigarette smoke shroud the film in an air of 'trippiness' or psychedelia.
Similarly, the music and background score are so damn good. The 70s-80s songs accurately represent the cultural zeitgeist of that time, while also holding relevancy to the movie itself. The scenes are generally in-sync with the tunes at play. Cinema itself is a somewhat major part of the residents of Wasseypur and this gives Part 2 a rather meta vibe, especially with all the pop-culture references peppered all over.
Gang-violence, anti-heroism, regional politics and the overarching theme of endless gangster lifestyle are deftly handled in both the films. The eternal saga of pain and suffering at the hands of the powerful and the exploitative is portrayed along with how actions of the latter have ripple effects on society culturally, socially and economically. The desperation from living-at-the-edge is a recurrent theme, which gives a lot of depth to the films.
Ultimately, it was quite an experience watching the two films! One might accuse them of being vulgar, socially irresponsible and morally corrupt but that's just the way it is. Gang of Wasseypur series is an unapologetic representation of the insane lives of countless individuals living at the fringes of society. The many components of GOW come together to make a well-oiled machine, that's as uncompromising as it is epic in size."
A perfect story of War between two families that lasts 3 genrations.The Bihari taste and strong acting performances from Nawazuddin and Manoj Bajpayee made it a worth watcing
"I remember the first time i watched this when i was 14, back then it didn't mean much to me i just watched it because of the violence. Growing up i cant count the number of times i have watched it but it seems as though every time i watched it i uncovered something new in the plot. On to the review then; There are two different dubs for this film in English, the initial one i watched on VHS is much better then the one on DVD. The voices match the characters and bring across emotions very well in the VHS dub. In the DVD dub the voices seem alien to the characters personalities, this may be due to the fact that I'm used to seeing the film with the old dub."
"Concept 100%
Direction- 200%
must watch this movie to know how to make a film ans what is filmmaking..."
"Khoon kholega...

"Undoubtedly one of the best gangster films of not only Bollywood but also all film industries, this Indian 2 part crime film is a flawless masterpiece directed by Anurag Kashyap. Portraying the crudest forms of social evils, conflicts, vengeance ridden acts, gang wars, class difference, illegal arms and drugs dealing, craze for Bollywood, sexual drives, betrayal, love, lust, hatred, competitiveness, corruption, adulteration and hooliganism, Kashyap's attempt to bring it all in front of the audience just as it really is was nothing less than great. The ensemble cast of Bajpayee, Siddiqui, Chadha, Dhulia, Khan, Mishra, Ahlawat, Rao, Tripathi, Singh and (perhaps the youngest of them...)Kumar acted out their roles with utter realism and conviction by engulfing themselves in hardcore method acting which was so well lubricated by the aptly directed music of Sneha Khanwalker and GV Prakash Kumar which provided a rural score depicting the usual tendencies of villagers to dress up and maintain their hair styles imitating celebrities (mostly if not always- filmstars). The bloody, hostile, vengeance ridden, power hungry portrayals of each and every character is likely to stir you into reality and a much harder and unfortunate version of it then we are acquainted to....Where all the dirt and mug of the society seems to ensemble in the form of abstract commodities. The film feeds even the most minute of details....Owing much to Subodh Srivastava's costume design, Rajeev Ravi's cinematography and the Shrikant Desai-Zubi Johal-Rajiv Sunna trio's makeup. A crime and blood saga, Gangs of Wasseypur deserves a full 5 on 5 according to me."
Nice making and concept of creative supbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
"Crime family saga is a cinematic sub-genre with more or less established conventions (mainly thanks to Godfather films) and it does not present comforable terrain to come up with original ideas. Anurag Kashyap and his crew securely overcome such obstacles and create a distinguished amalgam of particularism and universalism. The entire story is set in a very restricted locality (in and around Wasseypur and Dhanbad, except brief Varanasi sequences) and in specific periods of time but the themes it handles are thorougly universal in both time and space.It may be argued that violence is aestheticized to an adamant degree but it is for granted that it is never gratuitous. Each depiction of violence has its own merit in progression of the story."
One of best greatest gangster thriller movie of the century.Its actually the tale of place called Wasseypur a coal mine area in India.The movie tells the tale of fueds which happened in real life also.The basic thing that drives the movie is vengeance.
"Gangs of Wasseypur starts off with a bunch of guys raiding a house tearing into pieces in the year 2004. It then flashbacks to 1941, and then, 3 hours later, ends in 1990, with a ""To be continued"". By this time, my head was hurting like crazy, and half the theater had walked out. Now take an intelligent guess on how good the film was.I know of people who've loved the movie, but it definitely isn't the one for me, and am guessing everyone. Unless you like such dark, vulgar films with no story, stay away.Acting: 7.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 3/10 Technical Aspects: 6/10Verdict: 4.5/10Please visit sasikanth.me for more reviews :)"
"GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is yet another Anurag Kashyap film and again he proves why he is one of the best directors. The film again is set in a North Town Wasseypur which is near Bihar/Dhanbad. The film successfully narrates a story that pasts generations, the story is complicated as usual in Kashyap films but his detailed narration is fantastic. The story may seem a normal revenge saga but it's not. The characters are acidic, in fact you don't root for any as all have shades of grey. There are several brilliant scenes like the shootout at the start of the film(as the family is watching Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhu Thi) which is continued in Part 2. In fact if you watch both films you'll understand things better. It does take a long time to get used to the lingo and the story but once you get settled it's a superb film The film manages to keep you interested till the end though at times it does get too confusing with half a dozen sub plots. The film also carefully depicts the 40's, 50's era till 2004 perfectly We also have some take-offs on movies like Nawazzudin is a Amitabh fan and watches TRISHUL(1978) in theatre The film does seem slow and may make people fidgety plus the violence does startle for people who are used to watch Salman jump buildings, remove his shirt or SRK's movies. Direction by Anurag Kashyap is terrific Music is superb, all songs mostly in background are fab Dialogues as usual pack a punchIn Anurag Kashyap films he always introduces us to fresh talents plus extracts finest performances from them. Manoj Bajpayee makes a terrific comeback, he is tremendous in a role only he could play, with those cold expressions and eyes and his dial delivery he proves yet again he is a brilliant performer.The film does have other great performances too Richa Chadha who is launched with this film is flawless as his wife and portrays the various shades(spewing bad words) tremendously Reema Sen too is effective Piyush Mishra excels, Nawazuddin Siddiqui(is the lead in part 2) gets a brief role but does a great job as usual, talking with his expressions. He looks perfectly the character Huma Qureshi is decent in a brief role, Vipin Sharma is good in his role Tigmanshu Dhulia who directed HAASIL, CHARAS and SAHEB BIWI AUR GANGSTER makes his acting debut and he is the find of the year He is simply flawless and outstanding in his act"
"I saw this movie on DVD last week. I had heard about this movie and had liked the promos. Usually, I like these kind of movies that are not commercial and then have characters that are based in real location. I must say that I am disappointed after having just seen only the part one. Movie looked very disjointed to me. The characters didn't seem real. The rise in power of various characters seemed very unnatural to me. Manoj Bajpayee is a good actor but what he did in this movie is same as what he has done in other movies. None of the female characters were impressive except getting a few lines that you would not expect females to say. I loved Sneha's music in LSD but was somewhat disappointed to hear her music in this movie. There was really no song I can remember from this movie except may be one line ""keh ke loonga"" (loosely translates to ""I will tell and then take your .."").Disappointed by part 1 but will wait to see part 2.Just saw part2 of this movie on DVD. Part2 was really more of part 1 with the next generation involved in killing and philandering. I did not like either parts and was disappointed."
"Avoid this utter rubbish if you can unless you want to torture yourself.This movie is nothing but filth from the beginning to the end.The story line is absolutely scattered and wandering from one plot to another looks like someone was scribbling the screenplay while the shooting was ongoing,The audience in the hall was as confused they didn't know if this was a comedy or a gangland movie,IMO and the way they were laughing at every filthy word the audience rated this as a comedy. Songs were pathetic too so you can now imagine what utter nonsense this apology for a movie is."
"It's been a long time since a movie has come in bollywood which would make you say, once more. In the recent times bollywood has tried a lot with super heroes coming and flying, love stories with a western touch, awful sequels and horrifying remakes, but this gem from Anurag Kashyap truly deserves a 25 topo ki salami. The movie is set out in a never heard location where the coal mafia and our sweet politics have tied hands. It starts of in the past when the Britishers ruled the nation, and how when they left the whole game of mining changed. The characters of Sultana Daku have been highlighted with strong history and then remade into the world by Shahid Khan(Jaideep Ahlawat). He was killed by his own recruiter Ramadhari Singh who owned the mines after independence, and then set the whole story for the minutes to come ahead. Sardar Khan(Manoj Bajpayee) the protagonist, the son of Shahid Khan and the to be mafia of Wasseypur is all burning with the fire of revenge as he comes to know about his father's death on to the hands of Ramadhari singh. He cleverly enters the campaign of former and slowly gathers power, money and prestige to play against him. But he was not his only enemy, the movie brings out another revenge seeker group of Qureshi's. Revenge, humor, strong performances and situation-ally accurate music hold the key for you to bear the 165 min long drama of Anurag Kashyap. Backed by the stupendous story of revenge, the director has been more than successful in delivering an experience not to be forgotten for a long time. The direction and screenplay are the highlights of the film which have bring out the true essence of the melodrama. All the characters have not just performed but have lived them. Not even a single moment comes when you will feel, oh i have seen this or what the hell is this. All in all it's a movie whose all characters have a strong impact to the way it progresses much like the greatest epic of Sholay, not that I in any way want to compare it with the latter but this movie would make you feel that the bollywood is reviving and the Hollywood will get tough competition in future."
