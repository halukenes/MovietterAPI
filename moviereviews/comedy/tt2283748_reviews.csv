"OH MY GOD Its the best movie of the year along with Barfi Story screenplay acting everything is perfect. Paresh Rawal and Akshay together created magic as always. Songs are awesome. This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance. Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshay had a short role but he was best, he was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything, comedy, emotions, love, humanity. This movie is a delight for movie lovers, only few biased haters can dislike this movie. Entry of Akshay Kumar was awesome. Mithun was awesome, loved his character, but Paresh stole the show along with Akshay. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie"
"We have always been taught that God is our father always fear God. But this movie say God is our best friend so love the Almighty. Excellent movie with hilarious content.Movie is story of small Gujarati businessman Kanji Bhai superbly played by Paresh who doesn't believe in God. His life take a big turn when he lost everything in earth quake, Insurance company refuses to claim saying this is act of God and can't be claimed.Thus he decided to take big decision and movie is all about that decision.Akshay played role of modern God. If you are thinking that why God is modern go watch a movie you will find a meaningful reason behind it. Akshay is excellent too. Movie criticizes the big business that is based on selling God or we can say playing with emotion of people.God is not in stones or temples. God is in emotions,humans. Do not donate big amount to temples just help the poor and God will be happy. Don't waste your time searching god here and there instead search in humanity. Be fearless and love the God.Must watch"
"OMG Oh My God! Is a wonderful film with an amazing message that everyone should apply in their lives!Paresh Rawal delivers an outstanding performance, one of his best till date.Akshay Kumar is top notch you can't think of anyone to do his role in the movie.Mithun Chakraborty is fabulous as a fraud preacher.Om Puri, Govind Namdeo, Mahesh Manjrekar and rest have played their roles perfectly.There are some glitches in the movie like abrupt camera work but it has nothing to do with the story or screenplay.Grip makes a movie perfect; That's what happens here, you'll get glued to your seats start to end!I don't know how the play was, but I simply loved the movie.After Watching OMG! My religion is OMG! Oh My God!I'll rate it 8/10 Unmissable especially for ""so called"" religious people wasting time, money, milk and oil at temples."
Oh My God is based on successful gujarati play Kanji Viruddh Kanji. Oh My God is a story of Kanjibhai who does not believe in god. One day Kanjibhai's shop gets destroyed in earthquake. Then Kanjibhai complains about God in court. Paresh Rawal is absolutely splendid as a Kanjibhai and his arguments about reality of religion will make you think for a while. Akshay also plays the role of lord Krishna superbly. Surprise package of the film is Mithun Chakraborty. His comic timing is bang on.First half of the film is filled with some good comedy sequences and second half will make you amazed with some heart touching and heart shaking scenes. Main USP of the film is its unique concept. The film ends with a noble message. Story is perfectly directed by Umesh Shukla and he deserve a big cheer.Oh My God is a must watch film for everyone because intelligent Kanjibhai and modern lord Krishna cant be missed.
"WOW, what a film, I was pretty much speechless after i exited the theater. The message this film gives is that god is in every human being, then why do we go looking for him in mandhirs, churches, mosaics, gurdwaras, etc Why has god and religion become a business, why do we spends millions and billions of dollars at religious places as people when we can take that same money and help the poor, won't god be more happy then. This and many more messages are conveyed in this movie through characters, like Kanji Bhai, Krishna, etc Another really plus point about the film is that it is told in a light hearted way, in a comedy, the film isn't very preachy and still conveys its beautiful and real message. For me when it comes to performances Paresh Rawal has just done such an amazing job, he deserves all the applauds, accolades, awards, in the world for his portrayal as Kanji bhai. Akshay Kumar as always is very good in a small but important role, his and Paresh's chemistry is just too good. Other notable performances Mithun, was really good as the sadhu, and so was Govind Namdev. Music was good and suited the film very well. All tech aspects were just perfect. Umesh Shukla the director is the heart of the film and he has done an incredible job, he deserves, a national award for his efforts, he was just that good. A special mention for the amazing dialogues very smart and well written,So all in all this is must watch film for not just the people in India, but for everyone in the world. A masterpiece film, this should be India's official entry to the Oscars. its that good and beyond one of the best movies ever made in bollywood. 10 out 10 rating"
"Oh My God!!!! yes this is what i have to say after watching this movie. Its just superb,it had everything,comedy,stunt,action,fiction,a serious message and a deep emotional connect. This kind of film is a rarity in modern world. This film not only entertains but also enlightens people mind.You are bound to ask certain questions to yourself after watching the film. It thought provoking and your mindset may change after watching the movie. Everything is said in such a gentle and comic manner that the film does not bore a bit. As per acting is concerned well,u can say nothing to the performances by all the character but to applaud and appreciate. Paresh Rawal in the protagonist''s role has been out of the world,superstar Akshay Kumar portrayed the role of Sri Krishna outstandingly,Mithun,Chakravarty,Govind Ramdeo were just fantastic and all other supportive characters lend tremendous support. The main plus point of the film is its novelty in the story,its acting,its direction and the plot.. You are surely getting amazed after seeing such brilliant film and if u miss this then surely you are missing the best Indian film ever. I can and i think no one can give anything less than 10 to this film."
"Adapted from a highly acclaimed Gujrati play named Kanji Virrudh Kanji, 'OMG Oh My God!' is An Entertaining, Well-Intentioned & Superbly Acted Film! Its an honest, meaningful, humorous & heartfelt film that definitely deserves a watch. 'OMG Oh My God!' Synopsis: An antique shopkeeper takes god to court when his shop is destroyed by a tornado.'OMG Oh My God!' is a Winner, without a shed of doubt. The Drama works big time & The Narrative is extremely engaging. Kanjibhai's battle with the Almighty, entertains all through, with hardly any dull moment. The strong moral as well as the entertainment quotient take the film to the winning post. Bhavesh Mandalia & Umesh Shukla's Adapted Screenplay is thoroughly entertaining & heartfelt. It offers a strong moral! Umesh Shukla's Direction is perfect. Cinematography & Editing are fair. Music by Himesh Reshammiya & Meet Bros Anjjan, is decent.Performance-Wise: Mithun Chakraborty is mesmerizing. The versatile actor plays the evil god-man with utter brilliance. Paresh Rawal is superb as Kanjibhai, portraying the stern atheist with complete conviction. Akshay Kumar is likable as god. Mahesh Manjrekar is excellent. Govind Namdeo is impressive. Poonam Jhawer does a decent job. Om Puri lends grace & clarity in a brief role. On the whole, 'OMG Oh My God!' is a must see. Go Get Entertained & Enlightened!"
"First time i thought its a copy of Bruce almighty or something, but no, its a whole different concept. I think everyone should watch this movie once. This movie tells a lot of reality which we never know or never wanted to know. But I think Umesh has done a very good job. Even Paresh Rawal has done a great job.This movie is worth watch in theaters. Teaches lots of stuff, depends on you what to take or not.Guys don't think anything, just go and watch.I ll suggest tell your parents to watch this movie as well.I don't want to criticize other movies which copies the directions or screens from Hollywood, but this i feel, everything is original.Yes some of the time you will feel, ""aisa real life me kabhi nahi hota"". but guys this is movie, and you can learn and take what you want."
"its is the best movie in the resent time with descent story. everyone is gonna love this movie. it really impress me,,,This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance.

"Movie is based on a person who is an antique shopkeeper name Kanji sells the idol in Chor Bazaar and main thing he doesn't believe in god one day what happens his child was made an Krishna in Dhai Handi what we say an Govinda function was going on. this was the point where picture take twist, he saw his child on TV and go to that place then how to stop that function and make his child to go home as his exam was to be happen next day that an instant he got clicked and he announces that Siddeshwar Baba the character in movie that the Baba wants to be get eaten Curd, Milk etc buy the people so all rush instead of watching Dhai Handi goes to feed the Baba and like that he take his child to home and that instant that Baba curses him that he would be punished by the lord and next day an earthquake takes place at Chor Bazzar and the tragedy part that only the Kanji's store got demolished ..........See Movie to know what happens! There a lots of fun and emotions during the whole Movie and one major thing You wont get bored at all at the End ...This Movie actually pass the message that person should believe in helping other poor person rather than feeding a lord Murti by donation ....!!!"
"This review is about how important this movie is for us.The movie is hilarious and i mean it. It is not the cheap dim-wit comedy that people have been relating to Akshay Kumar since a couple of years. The comedy is 10 star.Some critics have given the movie only 3 and a half stars out of 5. However, I say this movie is beyond the scale of 5 or 10. The reason being the effect it is going to or should leave on the Indian society where people live there lives full of superstitions. It is a message against that. And through sarcasm!!. There are many scenes in the film which will make an impact.Example 1. All the religious heads are in a petrified state because Paresh Rawal has sued the almighty GOD in a court of law. They then decide that if his case against GOD is strong, nothing would happen since people in-spite of being educated and learned in school listen and believe them illiterates instead of what they learn in school.So the message is that we are making it too easy for the mullahs, pundits and likes to create problems for us by blindly believing in and following them. They are not any higher or divine beings and their authority should be abolished. Example 2. Mithun Chakaraborty, tells Paresh Rawal that his efforts are in vain because people are God fearing & not God loving. Therefore they will repeat the social evil i.e. commercialism of faith again and again. That is they will go to temples in search of personal gains (rather than GOD) and will spend a lot of money on superstitions to get things done.They can be easily made into gullible fools until unless they realize that GOD needs nothing except love only from the heart. The only movie after three idiots that manages to deliver a strong message. There are just so many messages in the movie. It is for the masses of all religions and no God(if exists)has been attacked. It will reform you. It will make people more tolerable because it gives a message of sanity and peace. We need an open society. Please change yourselves. Watch the movie carefully and learn."
"I have been hearing about this movie from my friends for a few days and at last decided to watch the movie last night. It was a wonderful experience I can tell you that. The strong content of the movie, acting skills of Paresh Rawal,Mithun Chakravarty,Om puri and others have made the movie a tremendous success despite some needless commercialization-tricks and a few weak dialogues. Yes, it is true that the concept of the story is not what we call ""original"" but the importance to point out our narrow perspective as to religious customs was necessary and the movie is successful in that sense. Although the character depicting ""GOD"" was unnecessary and probably was there to make a balance. But the movie has genuinely picked the ""villains"" as these religion-traders are everywhere twisting the original education of religion at their own will, for their own benefit. I would recommend this movie if you too hold humanity above religious fundamentalism."
"First of all let me make it clear that you really need an open mind to enjoy this movie.Some of my friends who are hard core God believers thought that this movie was bit insulting.I strongly disagree. Director Umesh Shukla truly pulls off the movie of the year. Seeing the trailers of this movie I was sure this would create a lot of controversy but seeing that it didn't I guess people too accepted the logic behind the plot.The movie is really fast paced and some of the monologues by Paresh Rawal are worth watching millions of times. Akshay Kumar plays his role as ""God"" really well but sometimes takes the good guy character so far that it makes one think would this movie have been better with his part on screen reduced a bit.Even though this movie is a brave attempt considering how sensitive people in India are in subjects related to God still its plot is diluted a bit when it is shown that Kanji realizes that there ""is"" a God .Overall the ending is as good as it could get and leaves one wondering about the situation around.The movie underlines the fact that a good actor can singlehandedly take a movie to great heights. Hats off Mr. Rawal !!"
"Karl Marx quoted ""Religion is the opium of the people"".He tried to say Religion is not the disease, but merely a symptom.It is used by oppressors to make people feel better about the distress they undergo for being exploited.As a child I had grown seeing people trying to find solace in laps of some idol or subjected to some uncanny fear revolving around idols or god-men. I tried to understand difference between rituals & religion. This remained unanswered during my growing years.Omg addressed those tactfully without taking any diplomatic or biased stance on the subject. Adaptation of Gujrathi play ""Kanji virudh Kanji"" which is inspired from an Australian film ""The man who sued the God"",the story revolves around the life of a businessman Kanjilal Shah who is an atheist and ironically his business is that of selling idols of various gods.Being a person with strong self belief he is never naive to fall prey to the traps of rituals & superstitions.In one dreaded night Kanji's shop got demolished due to earthquake and since it is ""act of God"" as per the Insurance terms he is deprived of the claim amount.Shattered and angry he registers a case against God to get his money back.Since God's address is unknown he files case against the God-men, saints as they are supposedly agents of God- and thus begins a hilarious ride as one understands the true meaning of religion.Umesh Shukla's film makes a strong case against blind faith.The film has message for both the ends of the spectrum – the atheists as well as the believers.The makers of the film has diluted on the complexities of the play to take it to the mass.Even the executions occasionally drift towards melodrama and become loud but then the end justifies the means.The film is meant to reach a larger audience and the often didactic mode of the film strikes a chord.Bhavna Mandalia's dialogs are spot on with ample support from Shukla's screenplay which leaves an impression in many scenes specially the court room sequences and Kanji's interactions with God.The film rightfully highlights on the fake god-men and how they manipulate the weakness and fear of ordinary men for their own benefits.Referring to holy Gita, Bible, Koran the film points out that God believes in equality but the big ashrams and temples will let beggars die under natural calamity but never allow them to enter. In the talk show sequence Kanji reflects on the corruption within such organizations.Subtly referring to Tirupathi he tells how all the Hairs taken are smuggled to foreign land for monetary gains.Even the so called social service done by all such temples and ashrams are just to convert their black money into white analogical to a Gutkha(raw tobacco) company building a cancer hospital (referring to a dialog in the film).He continues how religion makes one bewaas(helpless) or aatankwadi(Terrorist). The film doesn't attack any particular religion but speaks in a general tone.In one scene we find a Hindu priest, a Muslim Malawi and a Christian priest fighting within themselves about superiority of their ""individual"" god,while sadly god himself(brilliant portrayal by Akshay kumar) hopelessly looks at the ignorance of the people.The god-men are either shown ignorant and egoistic or intelligent and manipulative.During the climax, God himself tells Kanji that God is omnipresent and the knowledge of divine truth lies within every human which is written even in the holy books but sadly people don't have the time to read them. Over the years they are manipulated and genesis of rituals happened.Sadly even the educated mass falls prey to this over years.A large portion of violence and in-division are existent due to the distorted concept of religion.In one of the heart warming scene we find people are queuing to pour milk over some stone and the whole milk is going out through the drain while a poor hungry fellow looks helplessly at it.Such huge amount of resources are wasted or misused in the name of blind faith.God exists in all of us.To worship him one doesn't need to go to temples and waste crores of money on idols; but one should help people as Swami Vivekananda said ""Jibe prem Kore jei Jon Se Jon sebiche iswar"" (Bengali) (Those who loves and serves the people are serving the God). Paresh Rawal again proves his competency as an actor and his Kanji will make his position strong among the stalwart actors of the nation.He uses his whole body to emote various emotions.Mithunda is another brilliant actor who can play a disco-dancer or a saint with same conviction. His portrayal of a knowledgeable effeminate saint who uses religious believes to lop off their money is brilliant. He does brings laughter with his gestures and at the same time makes us vulnerable and guilty at the thought of existence of such fake-god men traveling in BMW and speaking of humble existence. Govind Namdeo as the Hindu saint was loud and predictable. He did justify the character he played but could have toned down a bit.Akshay Kumar was restraint and calm which made the audience connect with him as God.Probably this is one of his best performances till date.Om Puri was effective in a small role of Muslim lawyer.The supporting cast were adequate.The characters were too one-dimensional and caricaturist at times but then probably the writer was more concerned on delivering the message than developing them. Low in production value the camera and editing were just about OK.Music was irrelevant in the film though ""mere Nissan"" song had some strong lyrics and apt visuals that would stay with the audience.The dance song ""Go Govinda"" was unnecessary. On the whole this is not a path breaking cinema like Wasseypur or technically excellent like Barfi but it has a strong relevant message that needed to be told and they have done it in a commendable manner to reach to an wider audience.It is a must watch-one."
"Oh my God is a very rare kind of comedy which makes you think and to a greater extent redefines your perception about religion. A very sensitive topic has been handled with grace. And you walk out of the theater thinking about what religion actually means to us. And in this age of mindless comedies , Oh My God is definitely one of the best movies this year and definitely must watch ! Paresh Rawal once again mesmerizes and shows his potential of shouldering the movie single handedly. Paresh Rawal is so very Kanji in this movie and Akshay Kumar for a change is likable. He is very much likable as Modern day God. The movie does get a bit boring in the middle but Magnificent acting by the crew makes up for it.Grab a popcorn and a ticket . . . and a must watch !!!"
Best movie of the year. It's a ride within a soul! A treat which will force you to think what's actually happening in the name of God! Also One of movie which you can watch with your family. All the actors were just too good. Paresh carried the full movie and must be the best person to play Kanji Bhai. Akshay was also a treat to watch did full justice to role he played. Akshay-Paresh are the lethal combination. They are best. Direction was also good. Some people might feel it offended but there is Special Disclaimer for those guys. Watch it with open heart and you will see it will leave a high impression on your life.Highly Recommended! Watch it or regret!!
"I think this movie is better than PK(2014). So it should be in the IMDb's Top 250 and not PK which is (during the writing of this review) at 246th position. I think such because both movies have same plot, more or less. But OMG depicted this kind of plot before the PK, hence it is better. Plus, OMG had Paresh Rawal, who is senior than Aamir Khan in every way. PK got the attention of people because of only Aamir Khan. But this should not be the thing that a viewer should look for in a movie. She/he should look for the content in the movie which PK derived from the Oh My God and basically, PK is the combination of Koi Mil Gaya and Oh My God, more or less."
"It takes guts to create a movie like this one.This film has used humor in an extremely smart manner to deal with a with a very serious subject of Religion.I praise Bhavesh Mandalia & Umesh Shukla for their creativity with the story writing and the manner in which they kept the flow of the film very gripping. And of course one cant say enough about Paresh Rawal, he immerses himself into every character he plays and again in this film he acted his character beautifully.I highlight recommend this film to be watched by everyone, it will leave you loving your religion (regardless of who you believe in) even more."
"This movie takes straight on the issue that is supposedly above discussion, Religion. Despite having a powerful messages, the movie is hilarious with its sarcasm of superstition and blind faith. Also, it brings out a lot of oddity in Indian religious practices, flourishing spiritual Gurus and new deities every decade. Paresh Rawal portrays the role of an atheist in a distraught situation to perfection. Also the movie is balanced with only targeting odd religious practices. One of the guru and God is shown to be on protagonist's side (the assumed good side).It is good to see the Indian cinema has developed guts to make such a movie, a country where Da Vinci Code was banned, a must watch."
"This movie is being subdued from viewers I feel, It is a fantastic movie based on true facts on how many people in the name of saadu's and gurus are looting the country. It is also true that it follows shankaracharya's philosophy of ""aaham brahmasmi""-God is with in me,doing good to others shows your godly character. Always listen to your conscience..Instead of pouring in your currency onto a religious Guru/Temple adopt a poor kid and help Him/Her grow into a better person than what they could have without you..! Its high time...,better late than than never.. Stop wasting Time and Money on these fake gurus and sadhus and lets work for the betterment of our statesmen,nation and the mankind as a whole! Sarvojana sukinoobhav!!!"
"its based on a north India play ....and very well adopted to film..highlights of movie is superb acting by Hindi filmdom real super star pare sh raw Val ...his acting is so natural. other competes for best acting is religious head actor (as religious head he reminds us recent scam hit religious heads)...... the movie is based on a very tricky issue and very emotional issue,but handled very well..no controversies at all..!from starting it make us bore but bit over we hook to it... after some time we never leave our seat...! its a refreshing movie of the year and scene changer of Hindi cinema.,...am glad to say its the one i was waiting for.. south dance king n a bang lady too there to dance u...if u not yet seen,see it... there are some faults but minor..i wont mind that.. its a must watch movie...i give 10/10 marks for it..."
"As a Muslim myself I was a bit skeptical to watch this movie,as I thought it would be all about Hindu Gods and stuff.But I read the reviews and the immense likes so I gave it a try and I wasn't disappointed.I always thought too that it's one GOD,of the same religions,this movie shows the truth how people are blindly worshiping idols and Hindu Saints are getting money out of all that. It's a hilarious flick which addresses the present problems,and I think everyone should watch this no matter what religion. Everyone gave brilliant performances and the movie doesn't lag at all.It's a mind opener for all. Bottomline:Watch it!"
"Loved the movie. If you are a youngster (3yrs-30yrs); you have to watch this one. As you are going to shape the ideology of our future world. Do it with right concepts. No matter you believe in God or not. Doesn't matter which religion you follow. A great watch if you are a logical person; and a must required watch; if it is otherwise. Very well thought of. In a country like India, it was courageous of the makers to come up with such a powerful idea. The presentation is so simple and apt that you connect instantly. Do watch it with all your family by any means you find comfortable. And if i may advise, see it in one go without being stubborn about your spiritual concepts."
"This movie borrows its plot from the movie ""The man who sued god"",,But it hardly matters because its one of that bolly movies which was well intended social satire. In a country where superstition is rampant, this kind of cinema is rather necessary that is why it worked also.To be honest this movie is technically weak whether its editing,cinematography and even direction but its still a thorough fun because of its protagonist ""Paresh"" and some intriguing blasphemy even though it was occasionally loud but bearable. This movie won't receive any award at any function but still its a kind of cinema that should be made once in a while which you can watch along with your family members of every age group.It is very rare that a movie comes with social message and at the same time with a high quotient of Entertainment,, Don't miss it!!"
"My 10/10 to this movie is a very generous score, but this is the movie which has made me write my first movie review, put in my first status on Facebook. This could be for no simple reason. My words here will fall short when i try to explain how well Mr Paresh Rawal has acted in the movie. He has acted superbly in the movie, maybe its the characterization of the role he plays, but the connect you will have with him in the movie is what best actors force you to do and Paresh Rawal has done exactly that. Bhavesh Mandalia has done full justice as a writer. Hindi movies are always characterized by ""Who is the hero in the movie?"" I'd say its the Dialogues, very nicely written dialogues.All the actors have done well Om Puri, Akshay Kumar (Small but a very decent role compared to the movies he has been doing lately)and others.Coming to the story, its no ordinary story, ""An antique shopkeeper takes god to court when his shop is destroyed by a tornado"" is what IMDb has said as a preview. The movie is about why the main lead does that and what he gets in return or returns to the society. The movie is not a laugh riot but throughout the movie you wont loose your smile.Please do watch the movie, the movie has a very good message for us Indians.PS: If you liked this movie and Paresh Rawal in particular, please do watch Road to Sangam :)"
No great casting in the movie. Still the movie is a blockbuster only because of the great script. Hats off to Paresh Rawal for his award winning acting as Kanji and Akshay Kumar as Lord Krishna.Akshay bags yet another super hit in his account. The way Akshay Kumar enters in the movie was awesome and his stunts with Harley Davidson bike was also mind blowing as per Hindi Movie standards. Very few Hindi movies have such strong script and OH MY GOD is one of them.The film direction is also good. Sonakshi and Prabhu Deva stuns with their amazing dancing skills in the item number. The movie is not that long and pace of the movie is also very good.You should go and watch the movie with your family. OMG Rocks!!!!
"OMG Oh My God! directed by Umesh Shukla is an excellent movie in all aspects.I was surprised to know that this movie has not been nominated for any of the categories in any of the Awards!Shame on the jury,for not selecting a movie like OMG-Oh My God! for the Awards and selecting movies like Dabangg 2,Ek Tha Tiger! The movie based on a Gujarati play,is outstanding.It has an excellent story,clever dialogs and amazing performances.In a nutshell,OMG Oh My God! is a movie which should not be missed at any costs! Story: A shopkeeper Kanji Lalji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) takes God to court when his shop is destroyed by an earthquake.The direction is excellent.The dialogs are witty.Performances: Without doubt,OMG Oh My God belongs to Paresh Rawal and Mithun Chakraborty.Paresh Rawal is excellent as the middle-class business man,where as Mithun Chakraborty is mesmerizing as the saint.Akshay Kumar,although having a shorter screen space than Paresh Rawal and Mithun Chakarborty,is significant.Om Puri,Govind Namdeo and Poonam Jhaver are good in their respective roles.All in all,OMG Oh My God! is an excellent film which conveys a powerful message.I am giving it a ten on ten.Strongly Recommended!"
"Umesh Shukla's 'OMG Oh My God' based on the play 'OMG Oh My God' which ripped off 'The Man Who Sued God' has garnered a lot of praise among the Indian audience. I'm surprised that it didn't arouse controversy which films dealing with religion tend to. Well, that's a good thing and perhaps people are growing. Regarding the film itself, yes it does try to make a point but it really goes its way by spoonfeeding the viewer to make sure they the audience got it. The narrative does slip every now and then. The execution is poor (unimpressive lighting, flat cinematography, dreadful sound design, average art direction, dull editing...). Paresh Rawal does a decent job in the lead role. Ditto for Akshay Kumar (who, by the way, looks hilarious in the Krishna outfit). Mahesh Manjrekar and Govind Namdeo are quite alright but the real star of 'OMG Oh My God' is Mithun Chokroborty who steals the show as a closeted Swami-type leader. His natural flair for comedy shows and the actor displays it with subtlety and excellent timing. Preachy and over the top is OMG."
"First clearing the air about its inspired status, the team clearly accepts its sources in a detailed caption in the titles, making it all official this time which needs to be appreciated. The caption said that the film is based on a Gujarati play, 'Kanji Virrudh Kanji' or 'Krishan Vs Kanhaiya', which was adapted from the original film ""The Man Who Sued God"" (2001) and then there were two more lines written below it which I couldn't read as it stayed for only less than 2 seconds on the screen. Still it was good to see that the right kind of credits were given to the original creator of the idea as it should be.As an Adaptation of the original film ""The Man Who Sued God"" (2001) The film is actually developed from the basic idea introduced in this lesser known Australian venture featuring Billy Connolly in the lead. And if one has seen the same then he is sure going to give a mixed response to OMG as it somehow reduces the impact generated by the original. Reason being, that in the English film the proceedings just keep moving in and out of the court and that's it. There are no separate tracks of various God-men and there is no Real GOD coming into Billy Connolly's home to make it filmy. In the original we only have a case filed by Billy against the God (involving the Church) catching the phrase ""Damages caused by the ACTS OF GOD"" in the Insurance Company's papers and then its all about the court and arguments given for or against the claim filed the applicant. In short, the film has everything focused on the logical points brought forward by the lawyers along with a beautiful insertion of ""A Sign from the GOD himself"" coming into the court-room towards the end, which serves as a pleasant surprise for the viewers.Plus the original had a brilliant culmination wherein Billy takes his case back, sighting a drastic conclusion for the society whether he wins or loses, which is sadly not there in this Hindi adaptation. Yet OMG scores decently on its own merit with its Indianised version of the concept which remains highly recommended even if you have watched the original flick or play.As an individual film making a new breakthrough in Hindi Cinema. Looking upon OMG as an individual film for viewers who haven't seen the original English film or the Gujarat play, it is no doubt an appreciable attempt by the makers giving us something fresh and new which we have been loudly craving for. Moreover it can also be called a daring attempt by the team, considering our society's conservative state of mind which always gets active when it comes to RELIGION. So in that terms the film successfully manages to make us aware of the so called ""Religious Markets"" strongly functioning around us like big super-malls with different names and titles.Director Umesh Shukla and his writing team adds many good entertaining punches which are able to make you think and laugh at the same time. Hence as it progresses, the viewer largely feels entertained as well as tickled regarding his individual religious beliefs, which I personally consider nothing short of an achievement by the entire team. But at the same time the film has its flaws too. It takes too much time to come to the point and then tries to add too many elements into the narration which were not required. Further, its main publicized theme talking about the GOD himself coming on the earth, seems to be of no use in its basic storyline. So it thankfully remains far away from the Sanjeev Kumar classic YEHI HAI ZINDAGI (1977). In other words, Askhay posing as KRISHNA (and that too on a modified bike like BATMAN) does nothing substantial in the film and is just added to give an extra edge to the project commercially. OMG also loses its grip towards the climax with some overstretched references of Paresh reaching the hospital and then THE GOD giving him the healing touch, which in turn seems to be added just to satisfy the religious sentiments of the viewers emotionally. Performance wise OMG is one of those few films which has its script as the biggest performer in its more than 2 hours of duration. However regarding the cast, Paresh Rawal is as always first rate carrying the entire film on his experienced shoulders, well supported by his entire cast namely Om Puri, Mahesh Manjrekar & Govind Namdeo. Akshay Kumar making his entry just before the intermission looks cute but the scene stealer in the second half remains Mithun Chakraborty as a Spiritual Leader (like never seen before). In reality the few Spiritual Icons shown in the film are based on some highly famous Guru's presently active in the country which you can easily judge without taking any names. Musically OMG doesn't have much scope but even then the producers have added an item song ""Go Govinda Go"" to en-cash the festival season featuring Prabhu Deva and Sonakshi Sinha dancing to the beat energetically. Cinematography and Background Score just serve the purpose well making a decent impact along with the minimal special effects used to showcase The GOD. In the last century, New Age Indian Spiritual Masters like J. KRISHNAMURTHY and OSHO kept saying this for many years throughout their life but very few heard them resulting in the present chaos in the country and world over. So here is OH MY GOD giving the same message to the people once again but deep inside I also know that the situation is never going to change for the very reason that,""We all are taught to be GOD FEARING and not GOD LOVING people by our so called Religious Teachers!"""

If you know that Paresh & Akashay are in a movie it's gonna be a comedy. but this movie is far more different than comedy. Paresh is at his best. His logic's impress equally to everyone. on one side poor people are dieing of hunger & we are wasting our commodities of mare blind faith. Money making of the contractors of religion is ripped open first time in a movie. Everything is good. but a bit lack of direction is missing. Some things needed a proper artistic presentation. Like God's stunts would have been more creative. In the end the whole Talking could be staged in dream or something. But overall it is a must watch for a different reason other than entertainment.
"It takes guts and wisdom to make a movie like this in a country like India. Fabulous story, great acting by Paresh Rawal (Probably his best).The movie appeals to all age group and is a family entertainer. This movie can touch you like no other. Fantastic. Please do watch it if you have missed it. Akshay Kumar impresses in his short but powerful role. Mithun Chakravarthy is a stunner, there is probably no role or character this man cannot convincingly portray. It may not be a big budget film, it does not even have big stars but will satisfy you more than any blockbuster movie with the biggest superstars ever can. It's money, time and intelligence well spent. Do not miss. Watch it with the entire family"
"If I'm honest with you people, I struggled to imagine how this adaptation would turn out as a feature film. Thus, I felt it would be most appropriate to go in with strictly moderate expectations. In the end, I'm pleased to report I came away very satisfied.The film itself, directed by Umesh Shukla, is an adaptation of an Indian play, which itself was an adaptation of 'The Man Who Sued God'. The plot however has incorporated various Indian elements, and the film on the whole has a very desi feel, and doesn't at all resort to insulting religion. It was wise investment by actor turned producer Akshay Kumar.Paresh Rawal plays Kanji Bhai, an atheist who is also a moderately respected shop owner who goes about his business in the typical middle-class way, until disaster strikes that is. Kanji, after being rejected by the Insurance company decides to start a court case in order to try and prove that his shop was in fact destroyed by divine intervention, but no lawyer is willing to take his case. On top of that, his family strongly disapproves of his decision. Om Puri now enters, followed by Akshay Kumar. Things get very interesting This film belongs to Paresh Rawal, who so effortlessly carries the film for more than 2 hours. His comic timing is to his usually high standards. Akshay Kumar and him make the on screen goings on memorable and entertaining, once again post the Hera Pheri filmsOf the supporting cast, Mithun Chakraborty impresses the most. The character of a swami (holy man) comes so naturally to him. Meanwhile, Mahesh Manjrekar also leaves his mark as the opposing lawyer, as does Om Puri.The main highlight for me is how the courtroom scenes are dealt with. You get engaged in the drama, and the inclusion of humor makes them even more enjoyable.A problem is that the screenplay builds the picture very slowly for the first 15 minutes or so. You might get a tad restless here, but be patient. The remainder of the film will more than compensate, I'm sure.I'm unsure of the purpose of the song 'Go Govinda', which takes up a good few minutes. It looks out of place. The choreography is top notch, however, and the Prabhudeva-Sonakshi duo light up the screen to keep you entertained.The cinematography is both good and consistent with the purpose of the film - it wants people like you and me to be able to relate to it easily.I should tell you that, as a theist, I didn't at all feel offended by the premise of the film. A small point, but important nonetheless.Overall this is an entertainer that urges you to think, and is quite right in its message.7/10"
"For several years, I thought that way we Indians, way we practiced religion,the way it is sold, it has been our collective sickness. On the name of faith, logic disappears. This problem was verbalised in a play which I show in Detroilt last year, acted by Paresh Rawal. Although play was raising issues about organised religion in India, it had got lost in its own argument. When same play is transferred into screenplay it has iron out all confusion and presented problem in a systemic way without destroying the fundamental question. This comedy has a serious question and we need to change our behaviour. As film it was entertaining with brilliant performance from Paresh Rawal. He seems a bit tired. Enjoyed Akshay Kumar as God. ."
"This movie is on top of my favorite movies. First let me tell you just go and watch this movie. It will help you understand the basics of religion and everything which goes around you.I have watched this movie i think on third day after its release. I still regret why i didn't go for first day first show. Start of the movie is really good and in mid it becomes interesting and in the end you will understand what is religion.Few people may find it difficult to watch this movie but trust me watch it till end. I don't want to mention anything related to its story as it will spoil everything.Paresh Rawal, Mithun Chakraborty, Akshay Kumar, three top actors of bollywood did a amazing job in acting. Awesome movie."
"Through the movie - Oh My God, its director (also the writer) Umesh Shukla has conveyed a beautiful message that we should believe in God but not in blind superstitions The exploitation of innocent people by persons who claim themselves to be God-men is depicted in a beautiful way. The highlight of the film is that there is a perfect mix of comedy and philosophy and it completely involves each and every one in the movie till the end.The story revolves around a middle class atheist shopkeeper - Kanji Lalji Mehta (played by Paresh Rawal) who loses his shop owing to an earthquake. Kanji then goes to claim his insurance but the insurance agents reject his claim saying that his shop was destroyed in an earthquake which is supposed to be 'Act of God' and hence he can't claim the insurance. Being deprived of his income and running out of options, Kanji finally files a lawsuit against God and demands the religious heads who acquire money in the name of God to bear his insurance loss. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as the religious heads and the trio of persons who claim themselves to be God men - Siddheswar Maharaj (played by Govind Namadeo), Gopi Maiyya (played by Poonam Jhawer) and Leeladhar Swamy (played by Mithun Chakraborty) get involved in the story and this lawsuit of God becomes an issue of national interest. The religious heads try to kill Kanji and thats where Lord Krishna(played by Akshay Kumar) comes to his rescue and the remaining movie is a depiction of how He helps Kanji in his legal fight with the religious heads and the message He wants to convey the entire world through Kanji. Totally, the movie re-emphasizes the old proverb - 'GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES' through a plot filled with humour and sarcasm.Coming to the performance of the actors, it was an outstanding performance from Paresh Rawal in the lead role and Mithun Chakraborty was also equally good in the negative role. As usual, Akshay Kumar was impressive with his role as a modern God. Other aspects such as dialogues, screenplay and background music were also good and I definitely say that it is a must watch movie for each and everyone. Finally, I would say that in this era where nine out of ten films are purely commercial, it is our duty to encourage these kind of movies which would boost the confidence of directors like Umesh Shukla and help them to come up with more innovative movies in the future which would be a blessing for Bollywood."
"Oh my God is a story about a person (Kanji Lalji Mehta) who loses his shop in an earthquake. The shop is located an area in Mumbai, known as chor bazaar. Kanji is a person, who even does not fear God and even puts God on ill usage, for his benefit. After disaster, Kanji lodges complaint against God as he does not get benefit of insurance due to act of God. The notice is sent to all bigger baba's. He first goes through a lot of resistance, but eventually people turn out in his favour. People from other religions also join him. Thus notice is sent to every religious head.Cinematography was awesome. Paresh as Kanji acted well. The build up of the movie and the execution was superb.It's a matter of great controversy that, whatever things people do like doing abhishek, lighting candles, chaddars, etc. Do they come out to be beneficial? The answer to this lies in the quest to understand what turns out to create a pleasant atmosphere in bigger picture. I mean no poverty, equal status to lives, peace of mind, respecting life, creating a better world. This can be achieved by investment of wealth in proper direction i.e for poor.Various religious heads need to understand the method that creates pleasant atmosphere from micro level to major only matters. If we put something in front of God, it should not go waste. Every bit of thing we keep in front of God should be utilized for good in some or other way. Eatables should be utilized for animals if not humans. There should not be any harm done to any form of life. Example Lead in kumkum has been killing animal life in water, which challenges the concept of respecting life. Things of this sort, should not happen. A movie highly recommended.I do kept pace with kanjilal at the ending scene, one of the instances that made me feel special.Rating: 9.5/10"
"OMG...what an year it is turning out to be for Bollywood!! 2 extreme cinemas, both ruling the same roost bole to 1 myan me 2 talvarein! One belongs to the likes of masses, masala entertainers (Rowdy Rathore, Ek tha Tiger) while others that matter the grey matter (a full list of them that begun with PST and Kahani and now unstopped at OMG!! Coming to OMG now..rather than writing a full review, i will mention its gist just like the acronym it is:1. Another non-chocolaty main protagonist - Paresh Kanjilal Rawal. He is known for putting life in whatever character he dones and this one is no different.2. ""Religion is the opium of masses"" and more so in a diverse nation like ours where the opium comes in different flavours. Making an eye- opener on such a sensitive topic is not as easy as it seems to be. It might appear preachy in patches but nevertheless its like a lecture we get from our parents after we err; and one leaves the cinema-hall with the same guilt. The movie tends to redefine 'God' and 'Religion'.3. Akshay as God might not sound like a believable bet but as the film progresses and by the time it ends one starts looking beyond AK to feel the real Krishna.4. Mithunda (doning looks and mannerisms of Sri Sri) is the surprise package of the movie. His performance as the diplomatic yet feminish religious guru was seriously - kya baat..kya baat...kya baat!!! Govind Namdev tickled through his loudness.5. Other supporting cast seems to be an ensemble of deja-vu characters from TV ads, nevertheless, endearing and non-starry.6. Music is well woven in the movie. Though some people find Go Govinda out of place, I feel, it does add some pace and rhythm to the story. A couple of others like ""Main to nahin"" and ""Hare Rama"" move intertwined with the movie.In all, OMG is a brave attempt from Hindi Film Industry targeting to make people understand real meaning of God, making a call to shun all material and ritual practices and try to find God out of statues. GO FOR IT GUYS!!"
The Movie is not at all like any other of its gener......It deals with a pretty much with the matter that hasn't been questioned yet.......Its stands out cause.....of its superb cast.......Everyone was great....it's one of the movie that first make you laugh then make you THINK....I enjoyed it cause i was already the non-religious guy.......but i'm sure it will have a good effect on people who are blinded by the religion...Overall......it's a good movie......WITH A GOOD MESSAGE...

"what a film!! every thing which an atheist or i should say a true believer wants to explain to a fool...is all their in the movie..but still there are some very small plot holes in the movie although the movie explains very much what they want. the real hero of the movie was Paresh Rawal, his acting was superb and add another gem stone in his career...while Mithun Mithun Chakraborty proves himself once again as a legendary actor he plays the character very well...and now Akshay Kumar prove himself that he can do these type of movies too...although his acting skill didn't match Paresh Rawal or Mithun Chakraborty...the script was well written. characters well played but there were very small small mistakes which did not take this movie to another height...i wish this movie to be seen by every other person on earth and tell them about what god wants us to do...(sorry for mistakes i made in this review)"
"Just watched OMG ! Making a movie like this in India is extremely difficult but the director of this movie had everything written so well. This movie not only makes you laugh but its makes you think about the reality. JOB WELL DONE ! I would not like to ruin you movie by giving spoilers. It does not matter what country, religion or caste you are from this movie is a must watch it brings us closer to the reality of being better human. It enables you to be a better person. As mentioned in Geeta its all about karma. Rather then spending time and bribing god you should do good to make him happy. I come from a Hindu sikh family and this movie did not hurt any of my sentiments or my views. It was very well written and director knew that Paresh rawal would be the best person to start with. Akshay kumar was perfect actor to play the modern Krishna he conveyed the message very well. I have written very few reviews on IMDb, because a very few movies makes go that far. Everything I learned from this movie would stay with me."
"Its the best movie ever made in India..just look at the simplicity and powerful dialogs...watch this movie for lots of teachings and to know about the reality of GOD and religion along with entertainment. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal are as always at their best and sincere roles-no useless jokes this time-Its really a good movie that you must watch with your family-a movie for both kind of people-who believe in GOD extremely and one who don't believe in GOD anyway. This movie tells a lot of reality which we never know or never wanted to know. Paresh Rawal has done a great job.This movie is worth watch in theaters. Teaches lots of stuff, depends on you what to take or not.Guys don't think anything, just go and watch.I ll suggest tell your parents to watch this movie as well.I don't want to criticize other movies which copies the directions or screens from Hollywood, but this i feel, everything is original.Yes some of the time you will feel, ""aisa real life me kabhi nahi hota"". but guys this is movie, and you can learn and take what you want."
"A good and must-see film. It was was thought provoking with brilliant light humor and doses of drama. The movie is a satire that deals with corrupted method's used by religious swami's in India to rip-off the vulnerable people, by creating religious myths that are not in the scriptures. The movie has a powerful message and only hope the vulnerable people get a wake-up call after seeing this movie in the theater. performance wise Paresh Rawal delivers perhaps his best-ever in a leading role, he deserves all the applauds, accolades, awards, in the world for his portrayal as Kanji bhai. Akshay Kumar in title role always is very good in a supporting role, his and Paresh's chemistry is just too good. Mithun da, was really good as the sadhu. 10 out 10 rating"
"This is one movie which every people of every religion, every cast should watch over & over again... This movie shows the true spirit of God & how we people are shamelessly commercializing the devotion for our own benefit...Akshay as Krishna was simple yet elegant. Paresh Rawal was impeccable in his acting & portrayed the character of an atheist perfectly. There was a lot of fun moments. But above all, the movie delivers a bold yet true message - God is a symbol of Love. God is not a tool for extortion. Today the common people are fooled & extorted in the name of God, & we accept it out of fear. But God is not someone to be afraid of. God stands for Smiles, for Peace, for Happiness. And the movie shows us just that. So I recommend everyone to watch the movie & spread its message to every corner of the world... God bless us all... Hats off to everyone who are a part of such a brilliant movie..."
"This is honestly the most beautiful movie i have ever seen. I mean, everything about it was touching. The right emotions, the right acting, the right timing. Hats off to Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar :) they really portrayed their roles well. I could not have been more awed! Akshay has always been a splendid actor but this was a role of a lifetime and he proved to me that the character really does live in the heart. He touched my heart with his perfect dialogues. Paresh Rawal is just amazing. There really is no word to sum him up. Everything about him was perfect! My perspective on religion has started to look different, although i still believe in the power of God. He is right: be fearless people; Most people are not god-loving people, they are god-fearing people. I am really proud of actually watching this film. Its a great piece of artwork and i recommend this film to everyone. It really is worth a watch!"
"This is clearly the most path breaking and thought provoking movie I've seen in recent times. India is a place where most people believe in visiting temples, donating money (and/or hair!) and performing rituals to please the Gods. The movie not only questions these practices but also leaves you questioning your own faith.The movie is not anti-religion or atheistic. On the contrary, it presents a strong opinion about the existence of God. It is probably Paresh Rawal's finest performance since Hera Pheri (2000).The premise is unique - A shopkeeper sues ""God"" when an insurance company denies his claim for his broken shop during an earthquake because earthquake is classified as an ""Act of God"" and hence not covered in the policy. The court then summons religious powerhouses from across the country as the case is accepted and argued in court.Mithun Chakraborty is outstanding as the evil/sissy God man. Mahesh Manjrekar is brilliant as the shyster. Akshay Kumar as ""Krishna"" is likable for a change. It's definitely a must see for all age groups. Go get entertained and enlightened!"
"Kanji Bhai (Paresh Rawal), a middle-class Hindu atheist runs a shop in Chor Bazaar, Mumbai, which sells Hindu idols and statues along with his friend and neighbour, Mahadev. Married to a very devout wife, Susheela, and a father of two (a boy and a girl), Kanji is a hardcore non-believer and routinely indulges in activities such as tricking customers into paying huge sums of money for his statues under false pretenses, and drinking alcohol while on pilgrimage. He also disrupts a local festival in order to get his son away from the celebration. The Hindu priest presiding over the function, Siddheshwar Maharaj, shouts at him and says that ""God will curse you"". That night a small earthquake occurs in Mumbai, but there are no damages at all to property or life - except for Kanji Bhai's shop, which has been destroyed completely. Susheela, along with Kanji's neighbours, tells him to accept God so that his misfortunes will end. Kanji refuses, and digs through the shop's rubble to find his Godrej safe, which is still intact. Opening it, it he produces his insurance papers, saying that ""no damage has been done"". However, the next day at the insurance office, Kanji and Mahadev are told that the policy does not cover any damage caused by earthquakes, which are classified as an ""Act of God"".Out of options, Kanji decides to file a lawsuit against God. He eventually visits Hanif Qureshi (Om Puri), a poor Muslim lawyer who was attacked and crippled by Islamic extremists for taking Hindu clients. Qureshi agrees to help Kanji, but warns that since he is bed-ridden without the use of his legs, he can only file the case, and Kanji will have to argue it himself. Kanji agrees, and together they send legal notices to the insurance company, as well as Siddheshwar Maharaj, summoning him to court along with his senior, Gopi Maiyya (Poonam Jhawer) and the group's founder, Leeladhar (Mithun Chakraborthy). Although a Guru of the Sect (credited simply as ""The Pujari"" and played by Arun Bali) asks the three of them to at least arrange a meeting with Kanji and hear out his problem, they refuse, deciding instead to confront him in court.Kanji's plea is accepted by the court , but religious sects come to kill him. Enters MODGOD AKSHAY KUMAR!!! The best thing in the movie. After this the whole movie teaches you a new way to pray. Preaches a message that don't find god in stones , find them in HUmans.Paresh Rawal is fantastic. Akshay Kumar proves himself yet again. Mithun Da is an element of surprise. Rest were good, above expectations. 10/10"
"I don't care if this movie is a copy or not, but the concept, acting and message conveyed are just awesome. I think this movie was required in India, as it reveals the true faces of priests who think offering money, food and clothes to the temple will fulfill one's wishes and also the people who get into all this and waste resources! I never believed in such an act! I'm glad that this message is conveyed- You can reach God through the work you do, through the people you help and by believing in yourself! This is a movie you can watch with your family and maybe change their views too! Don't get offended and face the reality! This movie has just made that entertaining! It's faaaaarrrr better than Barfi! even if the genres are completely different!"
"A man sues God because he thinks God is responsible for his loss. A gripping comic drama about the battle of a loner atheist for whom God is futile simply because according to him the way we happen to perceive God is ludicrous and especially because of the institutions, ashrams who swindle money in the very name of God. This movie, in a way, keh-ke-leti's of all those babas, sadhus, saints, institutions that munch money from the innocent public unwavering with their faith, in name of god and questions the notion of donation, lavish physical gifts to temples, churchs, mosques. It very much appealed to me because I have always been the same kind of devotee who believes. OMG, also mocks the mass phenomena that takes the community by storm once an airy larger than life notion is shown about a particular person. Not for once, this movie slows down, it is always a joy ride from start till end. Umesh Shukla deserves applaud for binding this movie so well given the explosive content he has carried out masterfully and the best dialogues, screenplay I have seen in Bollywood since a long time. It's not often you get to see a movie that challenges your opinion, defies your perception and literally shakes your age-old, orthodoxian beliefs from the core. On the acting part, let me admit, I was a bit sceptic because there was logic defying combination of Paresh-Akshay again. But, Paresh Rawal is phenomenal in his portrayal as a Gujju businessman he single 'handily' carries the whole movie on his shoulders with ease. Easily the best role he'd done amongst his last ten movies. Akshay Kumar great to see him back with sense, though I thought he overdone his role a bit at few places. Govind Namdeo is terrific with his role as Siddheshwar baba. Well, yes there are flaws in movie, like Paresh Rawal questions the unscrupulous ways of babas, swamis and in start he makes money by selling statues with fake proposition about their origin. But that's explicable given that God gets even with him ;)Overall, a wonderful movie with a special memo to masses, God isn't anywhereGod is everywhere. 9/10"
"Preachy? Yes. Loud? Yes. Has blemishes? Yes. Despite some minor hiccups, OMG makes some strong points and leaves a huge impact on the viewer and some of their viewpoints.Plus, the movie talks about possibly the most universal topic out there - God and his existence. However, OMG is not all about God and his existence. In fact, an atheist suing God is merely a backdrop. OMG talks about much more controversial things here. OMG shamelessly discusses the commercialization of religion, especially in India. It may not have done it with full intelligence, however, it's a brave film with a mark.Kanjibhai Mehta is an atheist who runs a shop that sells Hindu idols and ""murti's"". He is an open atheist and believes religion is nothing more than a business. A natural disaster causes only his shop to be destroyed. Kanji is shocked when the insurance company tells him that they cannot recover the losses because the disaster was an ""act of God"". This leads Kanji to sue this ""God"" character. Along his journey, Kanji is supported by a mysterious man named Krishna.There are many hard hitting scenes in the movie. The scene with Paresh selling the murti's, the scenes during the yatra. Not to forget Akhay's scenes with Paresh. The court scenes are outrageous.There are some problems here and there. The main one being that the film at times gets preachy. Also, Akki's intro is a bit stretched. Also, the last 10 minutes of the movie are also a bit stretched.OMG does shed some light into the commercialization of religion in the country of India. The film exploits the truth here for sure.The music is meaningful and fairly enjoyable. Mere Nishan is my pick of the lot.The dialogue is brilliant. Writing is excellent for the most part. Umesh Shukla's direction is extraordinary. Props to him for making such a brave film that too without hurting any sentiments.Performances are also complimentary. Akshay Kumar is there in a special appearance and impresses. Especially in the last few minutes. Mithun is good but acts a little weird at times. Govind Namdeo is good. Om Puri is good. Rest of the cast is good.OMG surely stands on the shoulders of Paresh Rawal. To say he's a fine actor would not live up to the level of talent this man truly has. Rawal sinks his teeth into the role and is nothing short of perfect. Astounding! Overall, it's a film that will make you laugh, make you think and eventually spark a debate. Highly Recommended!"
"One of the best movies to portray the true concept of GOD. All characters have done their parts so well that you won't be able to find the best. Paresh Rawal is at his best and Akshay looks very calm (portrays God very well). Mithun has done a very good portrayal of a spiritual guru or swami. Best thing is the light way of representing very important issue. After watching the movie, your view about God will surely change a bit. Some of the dialogue are perfect. Towards the end of movie Mithun says, ""They are not God loving people, they are God fearing people."" Just watch the movie and you feel some senses changed."
The idea and justification is perfect. Director Mr Umesh Shukla has done a memorable job. Screenplay by Umesh Shukla and Bhavesh Mandalia is very convincing. Dialogues are very logical as well as humorous. The item no by Mr.Prabhu Deva and Sonakshi Sinha adds spice to the film. Idea is very simple but making it convincing was a very tough job but they succeeded. Performance wise Paresh Rawal is ultimate and perfect at the level that you start believing him as Kanjibhai. Akshay Kumar is good. Mithun Da has done a very surprising character. He adds very minute mannerism to enhance the character. Music by Himesh Reshammia suits the mood of film. Simply it is the best example of Powerful message with the glossy wrapping of entertainment. Overall a must watch with family and children.
"Seriously I don't have words to express, this movie is such a masterpiece. It touched my heart like Taare zammeen par or Munnabhai, i was deeply involved in the movie throughout.First of all, I am also somewhat a typical guy like parwesh rawal, may be because of this I loved this movie more. I also never donate to churches more, and I have never failed to help the poor. I believe that If a person is doing good things in life, good things will happen to him also. Also, if God exists, he is not in the statues, he is there in humans.. Good concept..About acting, Parwesh Rawal was simply superb, he stealed the show. The producers tried to sell the movie with Akshay's starcast in the previews and all, but Parwesh was the real star. Akshay kumar was also brilliant as God.First when I heard about the story about the lead character going to court against God, and Akshay kumar coming as God and all, I thought the film will be another loser. But, after reading some of the reviews, I went to watch this and believe me, its Awesome awesome awesome. So friends, Don't miss this, This is a must watch film.. WATCH IT AND FOLLOW THIS.. Don't SPEND TIME AND MONEY ON STATUES AND ALL.. HELP THE POOR WITH THAT..I also seen one reviewer saying that its copy of ""Man who sued the God"".. Ya, they are showing this in the starting of OMG also. So, don't tell like a cheap copy.. Now all are doing the remakes, but the directors of the OMG presented this well to suit the Indian audience. All are bored of watching same stories of love triangle or love failure. This is something different, like Vicky donor.. Love this move, full marks.."
"The movie just tells that do not have blind faith in God and waste time and money. Believe in your work and do good deeds. Believe in the existence of God and do good deeds. Excellent work by Paresh Rawal as 'Kanji'. Good supporting role by Akshay Kumar as 'Lord Krishna'. Mithun has also shown a great act. This movie also shows how the people so called themselves as ""Workers of God"" dis-guide the common man and their business activities on the name of God. Corruption and religion are related very well. Comedy is equally added to concentrate on a serious topic of corruption. Dialogues are superbly written and presented very effectively. The Movie has potential to grab the audience through out the movie. All over its a great movie for such a Country like India where people are more superstitious than their belief in work. In the end movie gives a very good message."
"A must watch movie for all of human beings. The acting was very good.The thought was superb. Item number was also magnificent. This is a movie not only entertain you but also teach you. This movie clearly shows the corruptions and politics done in name of god.This was one of the best Hindi movie of my knowledge in this year. Hope all us will get lessons from this movie. This movie is a symbol of process for Bollywood. After all I will definitely call it a complete movie. You can find comedy, tragedy , love , hatred, revenge all in it. After seeing this you will just say ""Oh My God !"""
"Bollywood is evolving and coming up with sensible cinema and hard hitting cinema. To name a few ""kahaani"" , Vicky doo nor , gangs of wasseypur , and barfi are few of 2012 movie which i loved and should be seen by everyone . Another movie which i saw today which can be placed at the top of this list is ""oh my god"". Firstly hats of to akshay and paresh for making such a bold film. Most of the time people don't try to attempt this kind of cinema as they think people's sentiments will be hurt . BUT OMG IS MADE in such a way that it not only entertains you but give you the real inside of religious faiths people have in India and what actually happens on the name of religion, without hurting anyone's feeling.Performance wise.... Brilliant Acting by paresh raw al , he portrays the role of a shopkeeper with ease and his court room scenes r just brilliant . Akshay kumar has little to do in the movie but he does justice to his role . I cannot imagine lord Krishna being played by someone else oder than akshay.. But the real surprise is Mithun chakraborty he makes u laugh just with his expressions :-) . On the whole omg is a movie which cannot be missed , it is a movie with a message that makes you think even after the movie is over. Hardly Bollywood makes sensible movies so don't miss this one.... 10/10"
"If you are a person who gives a damn about the 'n' raised to infinity number of shitty rituals but has a strong belief in God, this movie is for you. Total justice by everyone when it comes to acting & a very strong religious moral which I personally believe and also wish everyone believes. Initially, I had no expectations from this movie, since it's not a chick flick :P Thought it would be boring to watch such movies. I usually like movies which have lotta graphics, macho kick ass guys, babes n stuff :P But in the end, I was like WOW! This turned out to be a one hell of a great movie. I would recommend this movie not just to all our youngsters but especially for our mommie daddie uncle aunty dadi dada etc who drive you nuts everyday with their so annoying superstitious beliefs in god.If this movie brings a change in even 10% of our population, it's a big success! GO FOR IT EVERYONE! YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED even a bit! \m/"
"For me, this movie is a hope. I think, making these kinds of comedies will serve purpose of cure for disease called ""Religion"". While growing up, I always had my doubts about religions. This movie did put right questions in front of our sick society. It make people think. A must watch for every one. For atheists in India, it is time to come out of closet. We do have a hope. Watching Paresh Rawal was pleasant. No trace of overacting and all the dialog were written intelligently. Some part were copied from ""Man who sued the God"". However, director tried hard not to hurt religious sentiments and did a good job. Because point is not to hurt someone but spreading knowledge."
"""I am God, so I can do miracles, but just because I do miracles, that does not make me God""~OMG Oh My GodThis is a movie on a topic that is very debatable. The acting by everyone was done well, but Paresh Rawal excelled and gave one of his most convincing performances ever. Akshay Kumar who is my favorite actor had a minor role in this movie and did a good job with what was given to him. The music of the movie was outstanding. Melodious music is rarely seen in Bollywood today (the Kumar Sanu era and before). This music was not only melodious, but it had meaningful lyrics as well. Now down to the topic.The movie is about a man who issues a case against God for causing an earthquake that destroyed his shop. At first I thought he would just find evidence to why God is bad, but what really happens is something that I did not expect. The movie explains how people pray to God only when there is a need to do it or how they bargain with God. However, God is not interested in any of that. He just wants people to be true believers. True believers do not consist of those that partake in such activities where they pour milk down a stone and waste it or give donations to temples for good wishes. It is hard to explain how great of a movie this is. To really understand how great of a movie this is, I urge you to go watch it. The movie can really change your outlook on religious beliefs. ""Be free from fear. Be fearless and have faith in the divine.""~OMG Oh My God"
"A must watch movie for all Generation of people. All characters were perfect in their role. This movie not only just give us few hours of entertainment but it also give us a serious take home message about religion and way of living. All situations are perfectly represented. The story line is just superb. It depicts the true picture or reality of our Indian society. It illustrated all type of practical aspects of superstitions in India with powerful dialogues. Watch this revolutionary movie for changing your perception about God. This movie deserves more than just ratings. In my opinion, this type of movie should also be promoted worldwide."
"some of the little minded people don't like this kind of concept. But it is the real picture of the real world we need to understand the truth of this kind of cinema it is the new age cinema not fearing from any concept protested crowd i suggest everyone to go with your friends, family etc to watch this paresh raval is very good in this film mithun done his role very well one song Go Go Govinda i choreographed very well prabhu deva & sonakshi looking good and danced well. keep it up. akshay kumar is good in the role of lord krishna and he looks charming. some of the punch lines are very good. the picturesqueness & concept is huge."
"The three best things you will take away from this movie when you walk out of the hall would be story, message and brilliant acting by Paresh Rawal. The movie is adapted from a famous Gujarati play Kanji vs. Kanji, which also had Paresh Rawal in the lead role. The story flow is gripping and you wouldn't want to miss even a single second of movie. With a unique case of a human suing GOD, the direction has been brilliant to keep the story in context and make sense at the same time. While words won't be able to describe Paresh Rawal's acting brilliance, the movie also witnessed impressive performances from Mithun Chakraborty, Govind Namdev and Akshay Kumar. Om Puri, as always, was impeccable even in a brief role. However, the major highlight of the movie is its war against commercialization of religion in the country. The extent of monetary and non-monetary waste to please GOD, not out of love but out of FEAR, has been depicted at various points of time in the movie. It is this fear, that dharma-gurus take advantage of and make billions out of it. And as long as this fear is there to stay, the blind beliefs are also there to stay. While Kanji is an atheist, he is well aware of this and also takes advantage of it in his own way to run his business of God idols. However, he questions this foolishness in the society and the searches the answers as well.In the nutshell, the movie offers a food for thought at the end and, of course, a brilliant movie experience as well."
"OMG turned out to be a surprise message-oriented fun-loving cinema with mind-blowing performance by Paresh Rawal.With his shop destroyed by mother nature , Kanjibhai files a case against god to seek answer to his downfallDirected by Umesh Shukhla , OMG was a full-fledged entertainment mocking at the fraudulent religious believers and hypocrites who fool people in the name of God . One such scene where people flock into the temples to offer prasad to Krishna Idol indicates how much people can have blind- faith in religious activity. Hats off to the director to give a film which no one has ever attempted. Based on the popular play , OMG throws surprise with every scene and is sure to be lauded for its daring story. Screenplay is tight along with crispy dialogues. Paresh Rawal is the soul of the film. He carries the role of Kanjibhai as if it has been tailor-made for him. Akshaye Kumar does decent job in special appearance.Overall . OMG is a daring attempt which should be lauded and appreciated for its wonderful message"
"@Ratan006, please watch the first 5 minutes of the movie, where they have clearly stated that the movie was based on a play, that was inspired from the Aussie film. They've even mentioned the crew of that film (Director, Writer, Producers.)The movie is based on mythology, and meant to make us understand the real values and morals. It's a movie that's made to open you eyes, and your minds towards the truth. When Akshay and Paresh team up, you can always expect good.I would suggest this movie to anyone and everyone. We've had every genre of movies of late (Akshay himself, is following this with a ""Khiladi"" flick). This is a more thought-provoking one. If you know someone who is not too happy with oneself/The Almighty, take him/her to the movie and you will be thanked.(The movie is meant to convey a message, and like most moral stories, do not go in, expecting to see a very realistic film. Just cherish the wisdom.)"
"A heart warming light comedy having its own flavour of satire. Except for the camera work being abrupt at times, an entertaining movie without even a boring minute.Of the regular fare that has been dished out in the past 4 months, I would rate this movie right at the top. Absolutely delightful performances from Gobind Namdeo and Mithunda. The 2nd best I would consider Akshay, in the role of Krishna - though a marginally longer screen time and a few more antics would be welcome. Of course, this effort washes away the ill will and the mental torture endured while watching JOKER. And of course, the cherry on the icing was Paresh Rawal in the role of Kanjibhai. Its been quite a while he has had a chance to top up Baburao Ganpatrao Aapte's character from Hera Pheri. Hats off to him!!Go enjoy this movie on the weekend with family and kids (I know my kids loved the movie)."
Oh My God!!!! yes this is what i have to say after watching this movie. Its just superbthis movie is really interesting.... i think this is movie say something to everyone in this present world..... follow the TRUTH its the only thing what u should rely on.... and this movies teaches everything to the right step..... believe in god from the heart not by giving something to god... as its some business. i really appreciate Umesh Shukla from my deep heart for making this kind of movie...... thank u sir....its a good movie frends see it and make it usefulll...
"OH MY GOD Its the best movie of the year along with Barfi Story screenplay acting everything is perfect.This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance. Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshya was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything, comedy, emotions, love, humanity. Paresh Rawal portraying the stern atheist with complete conviction. Akshay Kumar is likable as god. Mahesh Manjrekar is excellent. Govind Namdeo is impressive. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie."
"OMG is a thought provoking and hard hitting take on the enigma that is God.The performances are top notch, led by Paresh Rawal as Kanji. His caliber is well known anyway. Mithun Chakraborty as the effeminate Godman must be a really plucky actor to pull this role off with ease. He doesn't overdo his reactions and his antics bring a chuckle for sure. Akshay Kumar has a very likable cameo as Lord Krishna. The way he bonds with Kanji in his house is beautiful. The bike which he uses is a killer though his intro stunts on the bike are poorly executed but we can live with that.So overall the movie is a Good Watch and Highly Recommended.My Ratings - 10/10"
OH MY GOD ... is really OMG ..its a story which we cant ever expect on the cinemas .. Story base line is perfect .. as far as acting point of view .. it is 20/10 believe me ... Paresh took the audience from akki .. he is marvelous ..akshay latest god .. you will go in love with kanaiya .. he s dashing pure .. polite like kanaiya .. mithunda a superb actor with comic timings .. Its humble request not to see this movie to just entertainment .. make your move after watching this movie .. it will change ur life.. it will change our life... try to understand and pen the blind fold over our eyes.. LOVE THIS MOVIE as well as 3IDIOTS .. best actor .. best story best music .. win everyone's heart.. I m damn sure ..GO with whole family ..
"OMG - Oh My God this is the best of 2012!!! ranbir kapoor latest was great but when i watched this, i would admit THIS IS IT!!! this movie is the real Oscar material, with no flaws at all... paresh stole the show for sure with great support cast by akshay kumar in the role of god!!! dialogue were just out of the world , you wont stop laughing as they were satire over this era!!! it was ad-hoc on account of this movie to motivate us to the path of fact n reality!! it was done with complete sense n with truly commendable performances!!! narrow thinking will be enlarged n the person will start to think at a broader level, for me being an ATHEIST this is one of the best movie i watched in my life!!! 10 stars for sure!!!!"
"The movie with its down to earth reality is bound to strike at the heart of our blind superstitions.The movie,throughout its tenure mixes truth with sharp-witted comedy.Initially,the movie starts with depiction of Kanji bhai's atheism & ends with a message to understand almighty in a different perspective altogether. Besides,how the masses neglect truth in the name of appeasing God & blindly rely on priests for same is clearly depicted.It is indeed a hilarious comedy movie which clarifies the unholy nexus between priests & politicians to loot the masses in the name of God.The movie can leave u with a completely different understanding of Almighty. A sharp witted,well directed movie. Akshay Kumar as modern day Krishna,Paresh Rawal as Kanjibhai & Mithun Chakraborty as the leader of business minded priests have done their roles with sheer perfection.Best movie of 2012 along with Barfi.My rating:10/10."
"Just saw this movie. and i am shocked, after watching the whole movie i realize that there is no actress in movie. And believe my it is not required. The cinema in India is changing. We should accept it with open heart and arms.Story is awesome. Paresh rawal, he gives the life to the movie. A businessman who never believes in god, blames god for his lose. And drag the GOD in the court. The argument in the court is truth. The bitter truth of religion and the marketing of god. Paresh rawal reveals everything about business of religion. Our society should accept this type of movies. Cause this type of movies can improve the society of India.Please people go for this movie. Change your mind, change your taste. This movie deserves 10 star. And really, at least, public attention."
"OMG! Oh My God..an intellectually stimulating comedy.. at the centre of which lies a storm of revolutionary ideas dabbling in a sea of beautiful thought. An incredible tale that rightly seeks to redefine the the concept of God in the context of modern-day reality.. that carefully distinguishes between Gods and god men.. frees God from the shackles imposed by the numerous religions and unites him back with humanity..not with blasphemous talk but with powerful logic.The story and the scenes raise the right questions and demand the audience to rethink their stance on God and religion. More than being an entertainer, it is an act of revolution..It is..an ""act of God"".. ""Majhab insaano ke liye banaya gaya tha..Insaan majhab ke liye nahi"" (Religion was made for man..but man was not made for religion) Kanji Bhai !!.Salute !!"
"**** first time writing a review ,so sorry for naiveness.. was just getting bore at home and thought of watching this movie..and oh boy..what a movie..superb,..awesome acting..especially paresh rawal..show stealer and superb part by akki....and roles played by mithun da and govind namdeo and others as false god men are just awesome...redefine your faith by watching this masterpiece...screen play is awesome and so witty that never does it offend in any way and make whole movie a fun ride from start to end...Dialogues are amazing and contain social elements and one liners used by paresh rawal are very very good and impacting... don't miss it faults and of course nice cameo song by prabudeva and sonakshi...celebrate this cinema..kudos..."
