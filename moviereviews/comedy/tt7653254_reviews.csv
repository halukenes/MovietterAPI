"With many directors, producers and actors blaming Netflix and other streaming services for what could end up being the end of cinema as we know, the streaming service is releasing several films in theatres for a number of weeks to be eligible for consideration during awards season. Many theatres are boycotting this strategy, so aren't playing Netflix's films at all. The theatres in mostly bigger cities around the world that do play them , are selling tickets like hotcakes. After their short theatrical run, Netflix will make their Original Film available for their members. With Marriage Story, Netflix might even get their first Best Picture award handed over to them.Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story is an incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it's almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He's very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it's Charlie's turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She's a great dancer - infectious. She's a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they've written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator's office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. Nicole doesn't want to hear what Charlie has written down, so what's been put in writing is only something we, as the audience, get to hear out loud.What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. Happiness is a personal feeling and can't be disguised as something as trivial as washing dishes or forgetting a grocery list on your way to the supermarket. We get to know little about Charlie's childhood, but Nicole's family and home are something that's right in the middle of everything. There's also their son Henry (Azhy Robertson), who gets pulled into this. Nicole thinks Henry is just like his father - almost joined to the hip. But when their marriage crumbles, and distance becomes an important factor in Henry's upbringing, their assumptions are solely things that have been witnessed while being together, and are now changing rapidly.The change in personality, after splitting up and having to deal with divorce, becomes very clear in both Nicole and Charlie's behaviour. While Nicole seems very focused, meek and motherly, she turns into a woman who knows what she wants and isn't holding back anymore. The only thing she's holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn't want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that's changing. ""Love doesn't make sense"", and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who's always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future.The cast is phenomenal. Adam Driver is the strongest of the bunch - a transformative, unseen, heartbreaking performance that no one will be able to shut up about during this year's awards season, and deservedly so. Everyone is feeding off his energy and bringing their triple A-game to this truly exceptional film. Scarlett Johansson has never been better, playing a broken woman who wants the best for her family but can no longer wait for her dreams to become reality. Laura Dern as Nicole's divorce attorney is Elle Woods all grown up and commands your attention. Ray Liotta in a comeback to the big screen (his last big film was in 2014's 'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For'), makes you wonder where he's been all this time. Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother don't get much screen time, but are here for some unexpectedly superb comic relief.Baumbach also wrote the film and deserves all the accolades - a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his DOP, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor's facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman coming back to compose a score for a live action film (his last live action film was 2008's 'Leatherheads') - masterful!Marriage Story will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade. A melancholic, heavy-hearted yet joyously bittersweet story about marriage and its unfortunate path to severance in order to find happiness. No cheek will be left dry."
"This hit way too close to home, it was almost surreal how much the film mirrorred my own life. My parents recently went through a divorce and the way Nicole and Charlie's proceedings played out was almost too much to handle. It was almost too confronting, too emotionally gut punching, too real that I almost starting balling my eyes out in the theatre.It's like this movie came at the right time and in the right moment. Just when I needed it most. This week for me hasn't been the best, a lot of things have been overwhelming for me. The film in a weird way, despite all the events devolving in chaos, told me that things are sometimes awful, unpredictable and emotionally draining but that's ok. The performances, direction, script all came together to deliver something that will always be special to me.This film does have flaws, yes, but I don't really care, films like this only come once in a lifetime. Sometimes emotions mean more than cold hard criticism. I didn't expect this film to hit as hard as it did, godammit, just go see it already."
"If you want a feel-good flick, I strongly advise you to reconsider watching ""Marriage Story"". I am NOT saying it's a bad film, in fact, it's amazingly good. But it's also amazingly realistic....and painful to watch due to the subject matter.The story is an ultra-realistic story about a marriage that is dissolving...and it's painful because the viewer really grows to like Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). Like real life, neither character is totally bad and you understand both of their positions during the divorce....but it also is very ugly and awful to see what happens when lawyers get involved. Instead of the amicable divorce they both originally agreed to, it soon becomes ugly....and the pair and their devilish lawyers begin going at each other like pitbulls on a side of beef! Again...this is NOT a criticism...it's realistic and heart-wrenching to watch. I found myself crying during some of the ugliest scenes....and I am sure I wasn't alone in the theater!Overall, you see Johansson and Driver put on some amazing performances....so amazing that I'd be shocked if they aren't at least Oscar-nominated for this film. Well done in every way...and one of the better movies of 2019."
"Firstly you need to see this very realistic and just... incredible performance. To just watch the scenes without any context would be worth it. However.The thing that I don't quite understand is how all the promotional things says that you never side with one or the other. Constantly fluctuating between the two. That was not the case in this movie at all. I found myself constantly siding with Charlie. His wife who lied, manipulated and tried to bankrupt him goes between confused to pure villainy. And when Charlie after quite a long time eventually fires back to keep his child she acts shocked and hurt. When she has dragged him through hell and back while constantly lying about wanting to do things without lawyers or that it's just a formality. But even if you, as I do pick one side. And stick with it for the entire film. It is incredible to watch and worth every second."
"I bursted out laughing just to burst out into tears a scene later. And so on. It broke my heart into pieces and then healed it. Noah Baumbach shows his screenwriting genius once again, whilst every single piece of acting from leading Driver and Johansson and from all the supporting actors is absolutely impeccable.2020 Oscar winner ladies and gentlemen, that's what I hope for"
"I was glad to catch this film at the Virginia Film Festival last weekend. Baumbach's semi-autobiographical film offers a realistic glimpse into a divorce. His writing was also phenomenal, as I found every scene vital to the plot. The script was effectively heart-wrenching and was carried by two awesome leads, at their best. Although the movie was heart-wrenching, there were also other moments when Baumbach offers the audience a laugh, while drawing them back to vulnerabilities of the main characters. The cast was magnificent. Apart from the powerful performances by Driver and Johansson, the audience is able to find depth within each of the supporting characters."
"The movie the attorneys didn't want to be made.In which a loving but separating couple (played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) blow any possibility of a harmonious separation by bringing in their legal aides.It's a sad old movie in which the couple's divorce seesaws from still best friends to raging monsters. Their natural inclination seems to favour behaviour at the friendlier end of the spectrum, but by employing teams of attorneys (at great cost), whose only interests are fiscal and competitive, any of the harmony that remains between Driver and Johansson is cruelly exposed and used as a weakness.In the hands of a director less skilled than Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding, Frances Ha) we could easily have ended up with either a black comedy or an overwrought drama, but this finds a line between the two, by steering a complex and subtle, and lengthy, dialogue (he is the writer) that does not allow the viewer to particularly side with either protagonist - both have their faults and their virtues - but it's the actions of their attorneys that bring out the worst, not the best, in them.That said my wife and I both fell for Driver's side of the story (and only found out afterwards that the movie is based on BaunBach's own experience of divorcing Jennifer Jason Leigh, so maybe it's not quite as agnostic as we thought.It's a slow build, with several long monologues that just finish, mostly, before they outstay their welcomes.But there are also moments of humour. The visit of a social worker is laugh out loud funny and the rehearsal scene where Johansson prepares her terrified sister to hand over the divorce papers is likewise an absolute comic joy.But overall it's both deeply personal and very affecting at times, more than once I was reaching for the Kleenex, and part of that is down to the casting and the highly personal cinematography that shows off the two leads at their most naked (emotionally) and vulnerable with long, lingering close ups on each of them. That's one reason that the big screen is always better than the TV for feature films. Like The Irishman, though, this is a Netflix original and will not be on the big screen for long.Driver is at the top of his game and that means there are three serious Oscar best actor contenders this year - himself, De Niro and Phoenix. All three would win in any average year. Driver's one take performance of Stephen Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" at a piano bar is a real highlight and is about a man';s lack of commitment. It's an excellent counterpoint to Randy Newman's typically accomplished, and in parts quite jaunty, score.Johannson puts in a career-best shift. Not only is his beauty put to one side . No make up and often unflattering close ups, but she acts her socks off.Also of great note is laura Dern's performance as her lawyer and a cameo role for a sprightly, 83 year old, Alan Alda.It's a slow burn but it comes highly recommended from me (and my wife). Just go see it in the cinema."
"When I first saw the trailer for this film it brought tears to my eyes. It seemed to me like it was going to be a roller coaster of emotions, and I really expected it to be one of the best films of the year. Don't get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie. The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn't feeling it. Still, definitely a great film in every other regard, and I am likely in the minority about how I felt about the characters, so I would recommend giving it a watch so you can form your own opinion on it."
"It's based on the life of a couple who are trying to get a divorce and distance themselves from each other, they hate one another for all the mistakes they've made in their relationship, but they still respect each other and deep down still have some love for each other.
This is one of the best performances by Scarlett and Adam Driver was amazing too.
I guess Scarlett would've highly related to the script because she had several divorces in the past, so she knows how it feels during that phase, the heartbreak, the excruciating mental trauma you go through and that can be seen in her performance. She's so natural in the emotional and verbal fight scenes.
P.S: I watched it at the Mumbai Film Festival (India) and I am planning to watch it again once it premieres on Netflix."
"I came in to this movie hoping for something resembling a story of two adults doing what's best for their child even though they were going through a divorce. What I got was one adult, Charlie (Adam Driver) being dragged through a river of crap by his selfish, child of a wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson).Although the writers make an effort to portray Nicole as a victim by virtue of her moving to NYC to be with Charlie, the film backtracks on that narrative by Nicole's own admission that she was miserable in L.A. because of her then boyfriend. Nicole needed a change of scenery. Enter Charlie. She met him, moved to NYC, married him, worked with him to create a successful business, and then pulled the rug out from under him once his fame began to surpass her own.In an effort to justify her behavior, Nicole alludes to an ""affair"" Charlie had, but we later learn that it only occurred after he and Nicole were separated but under the same roof. As Charlie put it, he was sleeping on the couch at that point and living with a woman who loathed him for his success and her belief that she gave up too much when she (voluntarily) left L.A.Every act taken by Nicole in this film screams of weakness and insecurity. Nicole can be pushed and pulled in whatever direction anyone wants her to take. She and Charlie agree that they don't want a nasty divorce. So, what does she do? She hires the nastiest divorce lawyer in L.A. at the suggestion of a woman she has known for five minutes. She moves their son to L.A. under false pretenses and files for divorce in L.A. Why? Because her attorney told her to. The goal? To make sure Charlie has to hire an L.A. lawyer at great expense. You see, she knows he can't afford to fight for custody in L.A. But is that enough? Nope. Nicole then goes all over L.A. meeting with other divorce attorneys. Why does she do this (with her kid in tow mind you) when she already has an attorney? To create a conflict of interest in case Charlie wanted to retain a competent attorney of his own. Attorneys can't work with Charlie once she has poisoned the well you see. She does all this to make sure Charlie can't see his child. Meanwhile, she acknowledges how great of a dad he is. ""He does the things for their son that should bother him, and enjoys doing it. To the point that she hates him for it"".This was all done before Charlie even knows what's coming. In the meantime, Nicole continues to shower Charlie with praise and assure him she wants what's best for both of them. But, you see, Nicole is a coward. She cannot fight her own fights, and despite paying tens of thousands of dollars for her attorney (but first making sure that Charlie has to pay 30% of it), she forces her sister to serve Charlie with divorce papers. Why would she make her sister do this when it would only cost a couple hundred bucks to have it done by an actual process server? Well, because this hurts more. Charlie is close with Nicole's family. In fact, it's the only family he has and has ever had. So, naturally, Nicole wants his sister in law to serve him with the divorce papers. ""You have to take a side"" she tells her mom. ""You can't have a relationship with Charlie anymore"" under any circumstances. Why? Because, it's about the hurt. Nicole is an insecure child. Her only satisfaction in this film comes from forcing others to share in her misery.As Nicole drags everyone else into her miserable existence with the hope that it will prop her up, Charlie continues propping up others around him despite his misery. He is a legitimately good person who doesn't deserve the hand he is being dealt. In a fruitless effort to fight for his child, he throws away a $625,000 grant which was supposed to be used for his business. He becomes a victim to a society and a court system that assumes fathers are pieces of crap while mothers can do no wrong. Ironically, at one point in the film Nicole's rabid attorney states the exact opposite, that Nicole needs to be perfect but Charlie can be a buffoon. Those who live in reality know that is not the case. It takes something bordering on child endangerment before a mother loses priority when it comes to custody.Ultimately, Charlie does what every man seems to do in these films. He loses. First he loses his wife because she decides on a whim that New York is no longer good enough. Then he loses his son when she moves him to L.A. under the cover of night. Finally, Charlie loses his livelihood when he can no longer afford to keep the theater open and has to choose between his life's work and his son. As the film closes we see that he has lost once more. He has lost his will to fight. He takes a menial job in Los Angeles (to Nicole's dismay mind you) directing small bit plays. His status as an up and coming Broadway director is gone. Nicole has gotten everything she wanted without even the tiniest compromise. Charlie has lost everything. He has been handed a pile of crap by his wife and is being told in no uncertain terms that he will eat it and tell her how great it tastes. If he refuses, he won't see his child.While it is obvious that Johannson is not Nicole, she embodies her completely, and I personally wonder if I will enjoy her other movies in the future given how despicable a character Nicole is in this film. 5 stars out of 10 for the acting and direction, but the way Nicole's character was written makes me wonder what the goal of this film is. It certainly is not intended to make anyone feel good about the state of humanity as it currently exists."
"Noah Baumbach has always had a knack for portraying the mundanity of life with such great detail and grace, and Marriage Story is yet another melodrama that shows how skillful he is.Marriage Story is a delicate dance of paradoxical emotions, weaving together themes of love, loneliness, heartbreak, and regret in such a manner that perfectly reflects the imperfect nature of human relationships.Adam Driver kills as Charlie, but Scarlett Johansson destroys as Nicole. Their performances are as intertwined as they are fragmented, and they bounce off each other with effortless chemistry.Marriage Story is a powerhouse of craft on all fronts. It is completely arresting and intimate. Baumbach reminds us how delicate love is, and that - amidst all the chaos that comes with it - there can always be beauty even in despondency and heartbreak."
"Couple agrees to divorce and settle it outside of court. He doesn't care about their apartment, stuff or money. She can have it all. He just wants to be a father for his kid. The main female character then takes away his kid under false pretenses to L.A. Hires a top notch divorce lawyer and sees 11 other top lawyers so he can't hire them. She didn't sleep with her husband for a year and make him sleep on the couch. So she clearly doesn't care about sex with him. But then she hacked his email and found out he slept with someone else during the final stage of their dead marriage. Surprise now it matters! In the end she took his kid, home, surrogate family, money and career. Destroy someone just because you can! And people cry during this movie because it is so beautiful?? It is seriously a horror movie for every father! This is the same as wife beating. Can't believe the 10 star reviews here. Emotional idiocracy."
"I literally made an account for the first time to review this movie, but it just doesn't make sense. Two people pushing towards a divorce without any concrete problems. She feels like she's invisible and breaks apart an entire family, when I'm pretty sure she can just speak up. I'm sorry but these things frustrate me when people dramatize situations and ruin fifty lives with a divorce, when simply talking could help a little. I'm pretty sure many people can relate to it, and I'm sure my comment probably seems dumb because maybe a marriage is irreparable at times, but in this movie, it just seemed slow paced and hard to understand the divorce. Could not sit through it. However, gave it a five because the actors are amazing."
"I really had high hopes for this movie, since it had promising star power and an intriguing storyline. But it's apparent that most of this budget went into casting. Ten minutes deep, I was already cringing. The whole movie felt more like a stage production with overlong scenes, too much talking (spoon-feeding), and dramatic (though granted, not terribly delivered) monologues. It promises you a serious insight into a divorce between two good, well-meaning people, but its attempts at comedy fell flat and were hard to watch. Particularly with that over-acting, trying-too-hard performance by Merrit Wever, who came off as more of a cartoonish stage actress and whose character was more of a caricature.There were also lines that were just bad and poorly delivered. Like one toward the start of the film where the babysitter says to them upon their return home ""God, you guys are so attractive."" What? Nobody talks like that in that context. Little things like that make one wonder if the writer/director even bothered to get any second opinions.Driver and Johansenn did most of the heavy-lifting acting-wise, which gives us small windows of hope, but even so, their on-screen chemistry seemed forged and unnatural.Overall, this movie came off as more of a vanity project than anything else. Which can happen when you get a movie about movie people. The bones of a great movie are there,but a lot of fat needs to be cut. The script could be so much better with the help of a big fat red marker."
"The two main characters' performances are just soporific, not believable and quite actorly. That highly-acclaimed fight scene between the couple should be reexamined by the film critics: their progress and transition of emotions are just messy, not natural and pseudo-woody-allen.Honestly all the other actors and actresses did a better job, the two lawyers, Scarlett's mom and sister, and even the eccentric family-oberserving lady, all interesting roles to watch."
"Charlie and Nicole (Driver and Johansson) are a thirty-something, director-actor, couple with a young son. Charlie is a NY lover, Nicole is from LA and allegedly put her movie career on hold when she moved to NY to work for hubby Charlie's theatrical productions.The couple is going through a rough patch, when after ten years in NY, Nicole receives an offer to star in a TV pilot and moves back to LA, with her mum and sister, bringing son Henry with her. Nicole wants a divorce ASAP, while Charlie still thinks they are getting back together and does not catch the drift until he is served papers.Enter divorce lawyers, in the shape of obnoxious Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), working for Nicole, while Charlie hires - in succession - two lawyers with different degrees of aggressiveness (and hourly fees).What we have here is two highly narcissistic people, who want to pursue their careers and find that family gets in their way. Nicole wants to do more than acting, but Charlie never allowed her to direct. With divorce comes the freedom to do so, because what the world needs is yet another director - what a shame would have been for humankind if Nicole missed her chance.On the other hand, Charlie, described as self-involved, seems quite lethargic in most situations, especially when spending ""quality time"" with brat - I mean, beloved son - Henry. That kid looks a lot like the one in The Shining and he freaked me out.Johansson gets lots of monologues, which seem to go on forever. Driver is an actor whose appeal always escaped to me, giving another sleepwalking performance. Dern is OTT aggressive, the stereotype lawyer you love to hate. Julie Hagerty, as Nicole's mother plays borderline crazy and she's as annoying as most of the main cast. It does not help that both Nicole (with mummy) and Charlie break into cringe-worth long songs, stretching the running time over 2 hours. I started checking my watch about half way...Overlong and self-indulgent, this is uneven mix of ""Annie Hall"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", is still likely to find a large audience in the shape of anybody involved with a divorce (half of the US population?)"
"Don't get fooled by IMDB mislabelling this as a comedy and a romance. If I knew this was pure drama about the worst part of any relationship - breaking up - with long boring monologues, delivered with as much stuttering as possible in order to fake spontaneity, I wouldn't have bothered to watch it. This is not entertainment. It's just painfully boring and boringly painful."
"There's a lot of the kid and plenty of wailing in this prosaic, mostly boring series of monologues. ""The Squid and the Whale"" was a good movie, because the characters were all edgy in some way, and portrayed by real talent. The story developed and had compelling psychological turns. This film, on the other hand, is really a poor attempt to portray dysfunction and fails, even as it wails, and wails, and wails.It gets two stars for good acting by Laura Dean, Ray Liotta, and Alan Alda, who are not even given top billing. Scarlett Jo and Adam Driver are painful to watch. Sometimes scenes begin without taking any particular direction, or adding anything to a wafer-thin story.Also the purposeful homage to Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"" was a cheap attempt at elevating this thing. And ending with the same text that it started with, well . . . simply lazy.Give it a pass, or use it to help you sleep."
"Couldn't even finish it. A young hipster doofus couple with a young child decide to divorce, why exactly? Who knows. The divorce then becomes a contentious legal battle for no good reason. Yeah it's 'realistic' alright, a sadly realistic depiction of 'marriage' in America, where over 50% of marriages fail, mostly because people no longer believe in working through things, and kids are just collateral damage. The fact that Hollywood considers this an award-winning masterpiece says it all. Trash."
"This is probably the most overrated movie this year, I really don't know why this movie has an 8.4 rating, it is Soooo boring and has really cheesy dialogue that makes you want to sleep, don't waste your time and watch good movies made this year like The Irishman, Ford v Ferrari, Knives Out."
Surprised at the glowing reviews. It was ok but fairly predictable and an unsatisfying ending. Better acted by Adam Driver. Scarlett Johansson is a bit wooden in many scenes. And a word to both Adam and Scarlett: Don't sing. Just don't.
"I think it is nice that Noah Baumbach met and got close to Greta Gerwig in Spring of 2009 during the filming of Grenberg, when she was playing a woman who was having an affair with a older man in a film Baumback wrote. She's 25 and the male lead is 40 in the 2009 film. Except Baumbach was married during that year of close work. Maybe knowing this helps illuminate aspects of this ""story"" that are totally absent in the 2019 film.When you are in the film business, as screenplay writer and gaining fame and power from a first couple of hit films, and you are getting a divorce about a year after ""meeting"" and working ""very closely"" with an actress who is much younger than you or your wife -- while your wife is pregnant -- and then divorcing your wife -- perhaps it is a good idea to write a film which that ignores those inconvenient facts. I guess. I mean if you got a typewriter why not whitewash what is transparently proffered as your story to make it about mutual alienation and not something more tawdry (and more typical behavior of men in Hollywood).But I'm sorry: as an audience member I don't want to be lied to. Therein lies the problem with Marriage Story. It was an opportunity to be honest yet it is a profoundly dishonest film. In fact it is deceptive narcissism of a very high order. Exploring the truth would have taken courage and would have been brilliant and real drama.Sure we all lie to ourselves, but frankly I don't want to hear, or watch others' lies about their marriagse. An unreliable narrator is one thing, it is a good plot device, but not when sold as a reliable one.OK on the positive side half of the acting, specifically by Johannson, is great. Adam Driver seems sedate, but he is ok in this."
Don't get the hype. Story is very flat. Acting is ok but not Oscar worthy. More like a Lifetime movie. Don't waste your time.
"The good acting of the cast aside, this movie is disgusting. Let me say this now: infidelity in marriage is NEVER acceptable. What Charlie did, regardless of how unfair he thinks he's being treated in terms of not receiving his wife's affection is nowhere even remotely close to justification.That being said: this film's portrayal of a messy divorce is one-sided and clearly pushing an agenda.Let's ignore the flat cinematography, the pedestrian editing, and the dialog written by a 20 year old art student major and consider the fact this film is clearly pushing an agenda. Nicole lies, helps commit a crime, and manipulates Charlie because of her own sense of entitlement for some misguided sense of ""empowerment."" At the same time, Charlie is treated as a inept moron without her. The production company they have praises Nicole incessantly because of (no joke) her suggestion of arm placement for a performance. It is also custody propaganda where the idea of women wiping out a man's entire livelihood is justified because ""men are accepted for their flaws where women are not."" Are you kidding me? What ridiculous nonsense. It's as if the writer behind this dumpster thinks their own misandry is justification for every horrible act committed against a man.This is ridiculous. The parody of the fight scene in social media between the two is the least of this film's problems. Women DOMINATE in divorce proceedings, and (as somebody who have seen family members go through divorce) the men are disproportionately punished in the proceedings. If this was an out-and-out ""man bad, woman good, she gets custody and everything is right with the world"" story, that would be one thing. However, this is trying to come across as an ambiguous tale when this woman clearly chooses to lie to her husband, make him suffer, destroy every aspect of his life, and use her son like a prop in her machinations. And the film treats this as justified, and it is rather sickening.Art doesn't need to conform to your sensibilities of morality. It doesn't need to make you feel happy. The acting is great, no one can deny this. However, in the world of brutal litigation in divorce proceedings, this film is quite abhorrent in how the message appears to encourage pre-emptive, brutal, and vindictive actions to cause the most amount of suffering is rewarded in full. What an appalling piece of dreck."
"I would give the acting ten stars. The script was so slow and tedious to watch. You can make the point that divorce can be difficult, especially with vulture like lawyers, without boring the watcher to death."
"Terrible. It fools us in the beauty of its film stock. Baumbach always comes at us overwriting concepts into these mild tortures of the mind, he's like a malicious Woody Allen. but Woody had that filter of comedy-as failing in stand-up meant it's useless unless it connects. Plus he was informed. Baumbach wants it all ways on the merit of his brand, which is suspect to begin with. His scripts are always grating the more they talk. Its frame of self-reference through theater productions is a great thought, and we're offered the range of abstract bizarro theater to mindless sitcoms... of course! His condescension is infinite and goes in all directions. Artistic sincerity doesn't exist for him since he's still in this satiric auteur reality where authenticity is merely a gimmick, another abstraction of the intellect. Another clue is the theater players themselves, other'd as simpletons or fools for comic relief. Almost everyone is NPC'd. This is not wicked, but narcissistic. It's not that it isn't relatable, the breakups are the most real and painful experiences we have. It's that we can tell the lie. Scarlett rings false. She has already been a cyborg, an alien, a mutant, I was waiting for the moment she peeled her skin off in those uncomfortable closeups that seemed to want to demystify her on film. Driver rings false as her husband, as he seems to work not by his appearance so is wasted on film, but by his enveloping bro-ness. Too boyish to be so fatherly let alone a genius director. This is the least credible couple I can recall. Then all the ways it's out of touch. Remember they hand Scarlett a writing job out of nowhere and she thinks on it within two seconds, says, 'Sounds good but can I be director too?' and they go, 'Sure!' ...is that how it worked for you, Noah? Like what is this elitist reality they're pretending is ours? $650,000 grant? Sitcom royalties? LA v NY? Every review says Kramer vs Kramer, and that is doing this zero favors. Back then you could not fake integration. Word of mouth was not decided by algorithms. Today, Baumbach he's a rich kid wearing this as a coat, the film is not human but a tantrum with a blank check from netflix to do that thing that won all the awards. Its humanity is corporate manipulation for conquering all the other streaming services. And I know this is a low-blow, but I was psyched for it. ""Women are expected to be perfect."" The film is not neutral, it's about her actualization, even so much as she ends up a better director than him as he's forced into some kind of director jail. So it concedes his selfishness all along with his compromise, saying, he had all the fun. Scarlett's Story. ""Now I get what you were obsessed about."" For this battle-ground of the theater it offers her the ultimate prize of the Emmy nom, like it's Baumbach externalizing his deeply guilty conscience, maybe his privilege. But he sings, so takes some larger moral victory in taking the loss. ""You're the first person I talked to who treated me like a human"" ""It's because you remind me of myself"". Cynicism goes in every direction, everyone is other'd. But the film is review-proof, it works in the poster more than anything. It's in the title: ""Marriage Story"". It can't not work. It's universal, but it really tries, then it leans on cliches, nasty lawyers, comic visitations, there it works, it hangs on those for dear life."
"I was repeatedly embarrassed while watching Marriage Story.The wild tonal shifts (the consistent insistence on sitcom-level farce/borderline slapstick - perhaps especially pre-serving the papers) repeatedly derailed my ability to take anything or anyone seriously. The theatre troupe scenes were terrible (""A four-time Oscar-winner was sucking my-"" why is this sequence/character in this film?). The abundance of overwritten monologuing. The cloying and contrived reappearance of the letter. Nicole's (Scarlett Johansson, who overall fares better than Driver) big ""It's a game I'm playing with myself!"" moment at the poolside. Their *big fight* (which made me snicker with how phony and forced it was, then appalled by the pseudo-disturbing revelation from Driver). Ordering his lunch for him at the lawyers' meeting, then tying his shoe for him. Pukey, honestly.I'm shocked by the film, and the almost universally positive reactions, especially as this is from the same artist who made one of the great films about an ugly divorce: The Squid and the Whale.There are moments and sequences that work, and even work very well, and some of the acting has special moments of high quality work (from Laura Dern and Alan Alda, especially), but the film as a whole doesn't work at all. I was especially stricken by a scene from the film's shamelessly manipulative second half, as it seems to best reflect a repeated problem with several sequences. It comes when Charlie (Adam Driver) gets up to sing Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" in front of his troupe, then goes to sit down after some awkwardness and mild friendly praise, but then inexplicably stands again and sings more - the rest of the song, in fact - and the film wants so desperately for this sequence to be telling and revelatory, and yet it moves from what starts to approach camp before stumbling into a desperate reach for his character's (clunky) pained lament(s). It's painful, yes, but not as intended, I'm afraid.No one felt like a real person to me. No one talks like these characters talk.The biggest cinematic surprise of the year for me was just how silly this turned out to be.Grade: C-"
"Noah Baumbach's down-to-earth take on the pitfalls of divorce for two young parents is bolstered by emotionally weighty performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, both of whom do some of their best work ever here. There is also a strong supporting cast, including Julie Hagerty as Johansson's mother, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta who both give witty performances as the jousting divorce attorneys on opposites sides.The film's emotional labyrinth is gradually negotiated by the two leads and includes a pained, stately soundtrack that hits all the right notes. Another plus is the film's lush cinematography that gives an unhappy story a surprisingly sunny aura. Even though we are watching two people during the worst period in their lives, the world around them seems comforting and warm.Usually, Baumbach's filmmaking style can be very blunt, sometimes even downright tactless. But here, his signature tone feels right at home as he portrays the frustration, heartbreak and fury that is the battle of wills of two people struggling to reach one another. It's not always easy to watch but it will leave a mark. As tough as this is to digest, it's still a work of excellence. Strongly recommended."
"Woody Allen did all that before but with more inspiration and better music too. This piece including all actors with maybe the exception of Laura Dern is a total sentimental bore - like really bad boulevard theater from the fifties ;-) That there are so many great reviews unfortunately doesn't bode well for the state of mind we currently have in this country. Obviously written and produced to get some Oscar recognition it fails on every level. Scarlett Johansson - really, what a let down. Midlife crisis maybe? Adam Driver? No, surely not. 2hours and 16 minutes because it's a 'drama' - lost time. All in all forgettable. Did I mention the constant syrupy music poured over every scene? Randy Newman - what was he thinking. After everything said though - it's never the fault of the actors and whatever hired hands, the disaster lies in the hands of the writer/director."
"Marriage Story is Noah Baumbach's magnum opus, an emotionally-poignant film that will surely be added the great canon of masterpieces and its awards-worthy performances examined in acting classes.Marriage Story navigates the emotionally-fraught lives of a couple going through divorce and masterfully places the audience as a helpless invisible child witnessing the trials and tribulations Charlie and Nicole endure. The humanity, sensitivity and candor in Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's performances coupled with an exemplary script provides for a grounded film unfolding with endless layers of depth that mine the audience of emotional catharsis.The simple title: Marriage Story aptly encapsulates the film. It's not a divorce story, It's about a marriage of dichotomies and dualisms. NY vs LA, stage vs screen, work vs play, family vs friends, actor vs director, performance vs authenticity. It may be hard to comprehend that throughout the film as we witness Charlie and Nicole fall apart but its in the final sequence that Baumbach really reconciles the dichotomies. He tenderly reveals to the audience that it was not his intent to show how different each side of the dualisms, but to shine a light on the overlap, the grey areas, the messiness of trying to draw lines in the sand."
"This movie will get great reviews. It will be a favorite of pretentious people that want to sound intelligent and every pessimist ever.The film was very well made and acted. Individual scenes were executed well and had a very unique visual and tonal style. But it just left me asking, why? Does this movie exists to help us understand that divorce is a terribly painful thing for everyone involved? We already knew that. Empathy makes for great films and they did that well, but I just didn't really get the point. Was this written in an effort just sit in sadness and soak up every bad emotion that comes with a marriage imploding? Not that every film needs a happy ending they don't, but some redeeming quality would be nice.Maybe I just didn't get it, because I didn't. Again, very well made but I would honestly love to have the two hours back. Seemed to just be sad for sadness sake."
"Two self indulgent adults allow their lawyers to torture them and their kid, only to end up where they would have been if they'd had the good sense and decency to just get separate apartments at the start. The characters make no emotional or intellectual progress from their journey. Zero. Nada.
Utterly awful."
"Marriage Story is a depressing tale of how divorce turns people into the worst versions of themselves. The dialog includes preachy/pedantic dialog in which the screenwriter speaks through the characters instead of letting the ideas come out more naturally. For example, her lawyer preaches about how women are treated differently in the courts, which is true, but we are left feeling as though we are at a protest rally rather than in a consultation. Similarly, his lawyer preaches about how the system is set up to make merciless adversaries of the spouses, which also may be true. In both cases these ideas could have been presented more naturally through just telling a story. While Driver and Johansson are good in their roles, the overall movie is a miserable experience."
I can not understand the high rating or this garbage
"A 93/100 metacritic score? Why?
I saw this movie yesterday, thinking that it was going to be a masterpiece. After half an hour, I noticed that I didn't care for the characters. The story, if you can call it a story, just dragged on from there. It's not really a story; it's more 'look at the struggle these 2 people go through'. This movie has every sign of a vanity project. There is loads of talent, but very little to work with.
Why is it called art when a movie has no consistency?"
Two selfish artists place their own interests over their marriage and guess what? They get divorced. A testament to the hollowness and navel gazing vapid gibberish that passes for meaningful expression in our individualistic society. Nothing insightful about this film except it holds a mirror up to how pathetic and transactional our society views marital commitment today. If you're into yourself and enjoy making excuses for your inability to understand the concept of sacrifice and commitment then this self indulgent diatribe is for you.
"Overrated, boring, long, not memorable at all. Instead watch Kramer vs Kramer, that is truly a masterpiece."
It shows how lawyers can poisoning two people that like and respect each other! Powerful acting too...
"The filmmakers clearly want you to like and identify with Nicole, but no. She is so selfish, flaky, dishonest, and vindictive it just makes you cringe and feel sorry for her husband and son who is clearly being treated terribly. I can't believe people watch this and think it is ""heartwarming"" - That is scary and sad for our society."
"This movie isn't a romantic comedy or even romantic at all. If you are hoping for a nice love story of a marriage being put together again, think again. This is not about rekindling a marriage or trying to make it work.This is pure propaganda that will make you fear marriage and avoid it like the plague.The preview and the title of this movie are very misleading. If you want to watch a movie about a brutal divorce and a marriage that could've been saved but wasn't saved, this movie is for you.Absolutely awful."
"The movie is called ""Marriage Story"" because it's a more appealing title than Divorce Story. But that's what the move is: the story of a divorce.In the opening scene, the two leads, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, at the top of her game) and Charlie (Adam Driver, likewise) read from their lists of things they love about each other as we see beautifully spliced together examples matching the words. It's a charming, funny, and heartwarming open, and it in no way resembles the anger, frustration, and occasional vitriol these characters will spew at each other over the next two hours of the movie.It turns out the letters were written after a suggestion made by the couple's mediator. He explains that he likes to begin with a positive note because of the harsh negativity that soon will follow. Oh how right he is.The couple continues to reassure each other and themselves that they want to remain friends and keep this breakup amicable. They have no need for lawyers until they do. That's when the situation becomes volcanically contentious.The lawyers know how the divorce game works, and they're hall of fame-level players. They gather all possible ammunition from the party they represent, then they hurl them at the other soon-to-be ex-spouse like a box full of live grenades. It's brutal to watch. Clever framing from director Noah Baumbach displays the discomfort and pain this causes each spouse to see their significant other lambasted mercilessly in court. Neither of them wanted things to go this way.As gut-wrenching as many scenes can be, laugh-out-loud humor slips its way into just as many moments. Give credit to Baumbach's writing as much as his stellar directing. Surrounding all scenes, both crushingly sad and delightfully funny, is unceasing truth and fairness. Neither Nicole nor Charlie is made out to be the villain. They are both presented as fallible characters who are good people who happen to be dealing with one of the most challenging situations human beings can face. Divorce can bring out the worst in people and it does here. Which is what makes it such a miracle that Baumbach manages to keep both lead characters so empathetic. Baumbach's work is award-worthy in both the writing and directing departments, as is the acting of the two leads.Netflix has been searching for a best picture winner for a few years now, and it looks like it might finally happen. ""Marriage Story"" is not only one the best movies of the year; it's one of the best of the last several years (and if this movie doesn't win, Netflix also boasts ""The Irishman."")I'm sure ""The Irishman"" is fine, but I can't say for sure yet because I'm still too intimidated by that three and a half hours runtime. But I saw ""Marriage Story"" and it was incredible. It's as good a movie as you'll see all year, in the theater or at home on Netflix."
"I really tried to watch this, I got through almost an hour, but it was so boring. I thought This kind of shallow, emotional manipulation, was abandoned in the 70s & 80s with Shlock like Kramer vs Kramer. Rich, privileged people, who have had it easy their entire lives want a divorce, oh boo hoo, let's make a ridiculously long, boring movie about it, just like the sad TV movies in the 70s/80s. The gushing reviews say ""oh it's like a real divorce"", well not if you were poor and a victim of domestic violence. It's an extremely boring, manipulative piece of annoying twaddle, I should add, from only what I saw. Realistic? Yes, if you're mega rich, all those who gushed about crying, if you're manipulated that easy, I don't trust your judgment."
"I'd rather stick hot pins into my eyes than watch this tripe.......
2 hrs of boredom 2 hrs of Scarlet jo crying looking like a young boy with her short hair.
If your into endless amounts of Flat diatribe then this is for you
Don't believe the good reviews they must be on crack ."
"The positive reviews on here are disconnected rich people who freak out over crap like this. I turned it off after 20 minutes, it is so obviously forced. The relationship is spelled out within two minutes and there's no showing only telling. The grandmother saying 'just because I have a dead gay husband...' was the end of it for me. I can't believe people actually liked it and it's nominated for awards. Wanna watch a movie about WORKING CLASS people who are REAL and MAJORITY? Blue valentine."
"A long, predictable and drawn out story that goes nowhere. Don't bother watching it."
"Unless your a new divorce lawyer trying up their game, this movie is a waste of time. The first two minutes of the movie are great, then out of the blue, diver. It doesn't make any sense. Both parents are protrude as loving couple and good parents. The only two things we learn alters one she does feel her feelings mater, well lady the line forms at the left and circles the equator twice. The only thing we learn, that is totally out of character, is that he has had an affair. The only thing that this movie demonstrates is have paper thin young people are between marriage and divorce."
"Acting is superb and starts off strong, but gradually begins to linger. It is a show about divorce and yes that is all those emotions. But what is the message? Unsettling and longer than it needed to be."
"Unfortunately I cant say that this film is good enough.
Something massive and essential is gone from the cinema.
Sense of family, unity maybe? That's why this family drama is not looking like a disaster, like a new Ice period.
It's just 2 hipsters doing their art and parenting a kid when they have a good mood and free time to waste. Because their 'art' thing is much more important lol.
Sorry Noah, but this film looks infantile and not smart, just a parody on Kramer vs Kramer made today."
"Because of all the hype surrounding this movie, I am giving it a 1/10 rating.The whole story is pointless.Adam & Scar Jo (10mins Oscar Worthy) performance is the only good part about this movie.Original rating is 5/10.Definitely not a ""MASTERPIECE"" or ""Best Movie of 2019"".Movie isn't depressing or sad but pointless."
"Seen 10/07/19 at the NYFF.As with other Baumbach films, ""Marriage Story"" is long on talk and short on cinema, which makes it a strange choice for a featured spot in this year's NY Film Festival, especially since it is the second film on the main slate about a director, in this case a theatre director instead of a filmmaker, but still... I, for one, have limited tolerance for films or plays about directors on novels about novelists, etc. These have a higher burden than others to meet in convincing me that I should care about them. In the case of this year's film director's film about, very transparently, himself, Pedro Almodóvar's ""Pain and Passion"" passes the test with ease, as it is glorious cinema. ""Marriage Story"", though, is more Neil Simon that Bergman (despite the aspirational allusion in the title and in a brief visual shout-out to ""Scenes From a Marriage""), or even Woody Allen, who is just as wordy but makes better cinema, at least in his older and better films. With its sorta jokey NY/LA rivalry theme, and in certain LA frames, ""Annie Hall"" also appears to be evoked here, but the mere mention of these films highlights the weakness of this one.There is some, passing enjoyment to be had. Scarlett Johansson is, as always, radiant and holds the screen in ways that few of today's female leads can do - she needs to find directors who can make more of that. Laura Dern turns in a stellar performance as a vicious divorce lawyer camouflaged in California unctuousness, and there are some fine cameos from Roy Liotta, Alan Alda, the great Wallace Shawn, and others. (On the other hand, Johansson's husband/foil, Adam Driver, is as bland and uninteresting to watch while he forces himself to emote as anyone I've seen lately this side of a TV sitcom.) But Baumbach remains firmly within his milieu of affluent, if not wealthy, Brooklyn and LA showbiz people and their neuroses. It's all very narcissistic and more than a little contrived -- as I say, this is more theatre, with its elborate, paced plotting intended as build-up to the leads' Big Scene, which here tears up the scenery - literally - to no great effect.Baubach in fact makes what I'm sure is an unforced error in a courtroom scene where, for the first time, ordinary (and diverse) Angelinos are seen waiting their turn before a judge, who makes a welcome comment to the effect that he is adjourning the case around which the film revolves as there are plenty of people with far fewer resources awaiting their turn. Indeed. And so the inevitable question arises: why, in 2019, should we care about these particular white, privileged, affluent, undoubtedly smart, but politically and socially obtuse people as they go through the predictable phases in the break-up of a marriage whose reality was never very convincing to begin with? Why should we spend our time watching what amounts to a modernized version of an old-fashioned drawing-room comedy, updated to take account certain contemporary sensibilities, particularly of the feminist sort?Like many of the other films shown this year NYFF (and of many more that are not), the main producers here are Netflix, which is rapidly carving out a place for itself in American cinema comparable to that played by the Canal+ cable network in France. Though its support to quality cinema is welcome (Scorsese's ""The Irishman"", but also documentaries like the terrific ""An American Factory""...), there must be concern about how long it will allow its productions to run in proper cinemas before they disappear into the streaming ether. In most cases, that would be a huge loss for potential viewers, as films like these demand to be seen on a big screen. In the case of ""Marriage Story"", though, there will be little loss: it contains so little that is gripping from a cinematic point-of-view that it will do just fine on a flat screen on an iPhone.
If you do watch this film, try to imagine what would be left if you turned off the dialogue. It would almost certainly become clear that you're dealing with filmed theatre, not cinema. A single image from the following night's NYFF feature, Joon-Ho Boong's breathtaking ""Parasite"" is worth 10,000 of this dreary film's many, many words."
"Story of privileged people and their sorrows . If u can relate to world of theater actors and their personal lives , watch it .. or else it s all
About long long scenes about people talking how life has been bad to them"
"A couple has one child.
He knew what he wanted and went for it.
She suggested things to him and felt ignored. Feeling unloved she stopped having sex with him.
Being in a sexless marriage, he had it with a coworker once.
Feeling like something like that had happened, she asks for a divorce, but wants to keep it without lawyers, she moves to another city.
She hacks his computer, finds out about the affair, and looks for a lawyer.
She serves him the papers for the divorce.
He ignores them for a while, because he's busy, and thinks they'll eventually get back together.
Untill he receives a call from her lawyer telling him, that if he doesn't get a lawyer and responds the suit, he can lose everything, especially the custody of the child.
He doesn't care about property/ money. Only custody of the child.
He meets an expensive dirty tricks kinda lawyer, but decides to go with an easy going humane lawyer.
Seems like he's going to lose with easy going lawyer, so he switches to dirty tricks lawyer.
In court, both parents see the lawyers escalating dirty tricks to win.
Out of court, parents decide to try to reach an understanding. They end up rehashing problems in their relationship, and getting angry and sad.
They reach a settlement for shared custody.
He finds a job closer to his son and ex-wife.Opinion: Movies are usually filmed in slice of life genre. That is, what the audience sees could actually be what you see in real life. Theater is usually directed in very dramatic absurd ways to reflect and heighten the emotional drama the character is going through. This movie combines 2 styles in a jarring way.
Also, the movie should be called ""not meant for each other, and problems in communicating"", because 1) they aren't a good match for each other. They'd be much happier if they had chosen other people to partner up, and 2) if she had been more incisive with what she wanted (job and city), and he had been more precise with what he meant (didn't make it dubious, leading her on), they would've reached an understanding which wouldn't have led them down this path.
Also, this movie is at least 1h longer than it needs to be. And the characters are bland and boring. Also, this is very chick-flicky, as she is being a B*** and doesn't get called on her BS (no sex, hacking computer, lying about the city change being temporary, lying about no lawyers, lying about custody, being jealous of the attention he's getting, making the dad be the bad father by giving too many presents to the kid, and not making the boy keep his responsabilities, drinking everyday, going to parties while he works, having sex with random people, taking the couch, relying on her mother for life expenses, while he doesn't have a parent to help him out, getting 2 dream jobs and an award, etc) (while he has to switch cities, spend a lot of money to pay for all the law suit, buy an apartment, guard her house, make the child be responsible, gets little love from wife and son, etc)."
"Last night I watched the first twenty minutes of Marriage Story. I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second.But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious inauthenticity...and don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch ""Bad Conceptual Theatre"" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of ""high art"" was slated for Broadway. In what universe?But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately sucker-punched to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved. And I don't need to be swaddled in a treacly, syrupy, honey-laden, jokey, telegraphing soundscape in order to understand that sadness or joy are on display. I'm pretty sure I'm smarter than that. My CATS are definitely smarter than that. It's no coincidence that Bennett coughed up three yards of hairball during the first thirty seconds of the movie."
"I watched this after reading the rave reviews online. Adam Driver shines, but that's about the only thing that makes this half worth a watch. Scarlet Jo's character is so unlikable and self absorbed, I found myself yelling at my TV. Even after listening to her explain why she wants to divorce over and over, I still don't get it. I was also quite disappointed to learn in the first act that they are both actors. This could've played much better if they were ""normal"" people, as opposed to pretentious theater snobs. But that probably reflects more on me than this film. 5/10. Watch Kramer vs. Kramer instead."
Thats easy the most depressing movie of the year. I just wasted 2 hours of my life to get completly depressed. What is the meaning of making a movie like this? You just see how a family that actually love eachother get detroyed. GREAT!
"I've tried my best to watch this movie, but simply couldn't keep my focus and attention to this badly scripted, non-creative directing, bad scenario and bad cast. I specifically didn't like the narrations from the both sides or either side of the married couple. I think if a movie needs narration to help it going, then it'd be such mediocre way to make a movie. A movie should not use some lame method as an audio book, if you need the actors to stand on the sideline to narrate and at the same time to act, that's just stupid. It only exposed how mediocre the screenplay writers are. The narration or talking-to-himself -or-herself formula is widely used in the Korean movies. Instead of acting, they used talking to himself or herself to tell the audiences what they were thinking. Narration, likewise, should only used in documentary films, for commercial movies with virtual characters, narration method should be the less the better.I also didn't quite like the male leading actor who actually looked quite dumb and his voice quality was just terrible. I don't know such a mediocre actor would have become a quite hot commodity recently. He just looked dumb, there's nothing on that face could allow me to accept all the roles he played in his recent movies. He just couldn't melt, mix and transform himself into all of the roles he played. He is always HE but not the roles he played.This movie also telling me one thing: Time flies and flies so fast. The leading female actor was once so lovely, young and energetic, but now, she seems suddenly transformed into a tired, spiritless middle aged woman and a very plain one; a very tired face to look at.This is a terribly scripted and poorly directed movie. The casting job is also terrible; so many old faces appeared in this movie and none of them just couldn't give me any realistic feeling of the roles they played. Their long existences in the Hollywood movie industries have already nullified their acting, no matter what roles they played in any movie, they just looked the same. Not quite understand what I said here? Well, go see ""The Irishman"" and ""The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)"", watch those old actors, all of them have become such formulaic and boring actors, no matter what kind of roles they played, they just used their stereotyped and trademarked, never changed acting formulas to waltz through all of the movies. They didn't transform themselves into those roles but only show their own selves again and again, the voice, the accent, the dialog, the body language, the facial expressions they delivered never changed.Sadly, this actor who played the husband role in this movie has already given the doomed impression as those old actors, no matter what the roles he played, he just looked like He, an never changing image outside of the roles or characters he played. And he didn't even looked like a believable husband in this movie. A big mediocre blend plain face with Jackie Chan's outdated hairdo. ""No cheek will be left dry?"" Well, better have your eyes checked soonest.Oh, by the way, if you are really interested in the ""Divorce"" genre movies, besides ""Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)"" that one viewer have already recommended, ""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin - A Separation (2011)"" is an even better viewing experience. Or, if you prefer a 3rd kind of dramatic divorce story, try ""War of The Roses (1989)"", see how a divorce would become so ugly but with a guilty pleasure to watch. Don't forget to check out these movies first on IMDB.com"
"This is a very dull story of two people who split up for very tenuous reasons and then we have to go through the divorce procedural with lawyers. The spoiled immature brat thinking of only herself and not one second considering her delicate son forces her husband, a richly intelligent and creative man, first out of their bed and then out of her life. I felt no compassion for Scarlett Johansson's character, and spent the whole time wondering why this script was so dull and humorless. I realized then it was because it was written too shallow and didn't explore any nuance whatsover. I don't know how it's being touted so hard, maybe because it's one of three or four non-superhero movies for the Oscars, but it's not really written into enough to be a classic. Watch Kramer vs Kramer for this film done well. This is not it."
The movie doesn't explain well enough why this couple is getting a divorce at the first place. All we know is that they're both competitive people and the guy is selfish. There's no depth in the characters. The script doesn't go beyond a bad version of a Woody Allen movie... A waste of time
"Mediocre story which fizzles then goes flat.
The characters are less than ordinary. Emotions remain dormant while the script envelopes you in a soggy damp blanket."
"If you want to watch a movie about the heart wrenching process of divorce without witnessing any of the heartwarming parts of the marriage, this movie's for you."
It's an overrated movie. The acting is tough to watch. Can't figure out what the genre of the movie is. A bad romantic comedy that tries hard to be arty
"This is a lot better than Mr Baumbach's deadly 'The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)', over which it's better to draw a veil. There is another film lurking in the shadows, however: 'Kramer vs Kramer', of which 'Marriage Story' might be considered a kind of 30-years-have-gone-by update. The ambition and unselfconscious self-obsession of Adam Driver's character is shared by Dustin Hoffman's in the earlier film. But Scarlett Johansson's character is allowed not to feel as guilty as Meryl Streep's for believing that she could be a better mother if she could be a whole person. Baumbach gives Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda very good speeches as a trio of lawyers explaining how the courts will stitch the opposing parties up.There are some funny lines and one really excellent scene in which the leads tear into each other, no holds barred. But it's Driver's raw delivery of a Sondheim song that will probably impress most.I wish I'd've liked it more, but in the end the travails of those in Mr Baumbach's navel-gazing world are not perhaps as universal as he might like to think."
"Couples don't divorce, families do. That's why the description of this film on IMDB does not make any sense: ""Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together."" When a couple decides to end their marriage, they throw their family to the garbage. This film is a homage to divorce, and that's why I didn't like it.Although with stunning performances, the film is entirely depressing. Why they call it a comedy-drama is a mystery to me. I didn't laugh even once. The message of the film? Don't fight for your love, destroy your marriage, scratch your spouse's eyes and wreck you children's lives.I'm sorry, but I think that to stay together and try to reconnect after a crisis requires a lot of braveness, courage, infinite love and forgiveness. I believe in fighting for your love and not in separation. And when you've decided to have kids, separation can't even be an option. Unless you are in a highly dysfunctional marriage (abuse, drugs, persistence infidelity), grow up and work on your marriage. Divorce is a failure. Stop treating it like something that is OK. Children carry the scars of divorce all their lives, and couples lose for ever the opportunity of reconnecting and growing. Since 50% of the people who marry today get bored after a while and seek divorce, I'm sure my review will not be liked, but I don't care.Some say this film could be Woody's. Of course not! Woody Allen's films are a 1,000 times more brilliant and deep that these 2 hours of depressing boredom. Others compare this film to Kramer vs. Kramer. Also not. Kramer vs. Kramer, although talks about divorce too, is a very deep and good film.The music of Marriage Story, BTW, is really annoying. The direction, meh. The cinematography is great, very long shots, and Scarlett and Adam's performances, I must say, are absolutely stunning. 6/10"
Yeah the two lead actors do a great job I'm not denying that. But some of these reviews I see are being far too generous rating wise. The only good parts of this movie were during arguments between the divorcing couples and their shark lawyers. The rest is slow and boring and frankly not very emotional.
This is so unrealistic it's offensive. I guess this came from the theater. It's stupid there too. This crap don't fly in the current world.
"Marriage story is a masterpiece filled with some of the best performers in the last 20 years. Scarlet Johansen and Adam Driver give the best performances of their careers. The emotion and passion they show is incredible. I can't express how much I love this film. It hit me at an emotional level unlike any other film I've seen all year. The writing is the best of the year and perfect. The movie feels natural and honest to the situation they are in. The direction is beautiful and masterful. The film as a whole is amazing and worth watching because it's unlike anything you'll ever see. Driver and Johansen and clear frontrunners for best actor and actress respectively and truly deserve it. The depiction of a divorce was so raw and real, and that's were this film excels in the sense that the film feels real. You experience every emotion of sorrow and heartbreak to anger and hatred. The score is great and beautiful. You can really feel a connection with each character of Charlie and Nicole and feel empathy for each of them.
Overall this film is perfect and one of the best in recent years. The performances are revolutionary and masterful. The direction is articulate and beautiful to watch."
"The horrors faced by divorced dads going through the family court system is only vaguely gleaned at here. It would take hours to explain what a dad goes through when he's fighting to be in his children's lives.
At least the movie shows some of this.
The Laura Dern character of a soulless, self-agrandising feminist lawyer is depicted and played with slimy accuracy.
As is the role of the self-centred and narcissistic mother who uses the child as a bargaining chip.
Johansson is hard to look at these days.
In real life, Johansson would have alleged being abused by her ex-husband, the 'silver bullet' which would guarantee that she gets everything she wants."
"The title of this movie should be divorce story,as that is what it is about. It is well acted, well scripted and well done. But it doesn't deserve the nominations or more than a 6 rating. It is a tale of pettiness and jealousy. Of greed and bickering. Of wanting a sofa not because it is worth anything but to deny to another because you can."
"I decided to watch this movie based on my friends recommendation. He hadn't seen it either, but heard it was getting much acclaim and it looked really real based on the trailers. Given my love for movies or shows that potray reality or don't have happy endings (one of my favorite movies to this day is still Requiem for a Dream and BoJack quickly became one of my all time favorite shows), I decided to watch this without viewing any trailers or reading any reviews.Within the first 20 mins I felt bored. I kept going to give it a fair shot to see, maybe it gets better. Nope. The only part i enjoyed was watching the lawyers, which was also, in my opinion, some of the only good acting on screen.The whole movie seems incredibly forced. There are SO many useless scenes that go literally no where. Like that scene with the woman observing Charlie and Henry? Not only was it, boring and awkward, it was completely pointless and didn't advance the story at all.I also hated Nicole. At first, I wasn't a fan of Charlie either, but by the time they reached the fight scene and you find out he only cheated when they were somewhat separated, I was 100% on Charlie's side. She's selfish, manipulative, a liar and puts Charlie through hell after making believe she didn't want it to be complicated to begin with. And then at the end, she thinks it's unfair that he gets 45% custody?! WHAT?! I was so annoyed by that.Then, the movie ends abruptly. It's just a terrible ending leaving so many open ends! I thought ""what? That's it? That's how it ends?"" when i saw the credits come on.I say don't waste your time. I have no idea why this has such a high rating or how it can make anyone cry. I cried when Frankenwienie died (Everytime lol) but this, this is an empty shell of a movie attempting to be deeper than it actually is.The ONLY part that made me feel bad at all was when Charlie takes Henry trick or treating after Nicole. She's a cow for not letting Charlie join the prime time and it's sad watching try to find candy. That's it."
Acting was wonderful and touching and sad movie. But the plot was very thin and it felt like a real divorce case (which was the goal I guess). But it didn't have much of an entertaining value. It gets 5 from me because the acting was very good but the story told in the movie was just sad and boring in my opinion.
"Movies about people who make movies are always suspect for their tendency to lapse into self-indulgence (much as novels about writers are), the more so when the writer is also the director (Noah Baumbach here). When this is accompanied by a running time of over two-and-a-quarter hours, the alarm bells are ringing before you even enter the cinema.Such expectations are rapidly and amply confirmed by this mis-titled movie, which drags on far too long for its own and the viewers' good. Billed as a 'marriage story', the focus is on divorce.But the subtext is 'woman triumphant in a world of pathetic men'. In short, this is yet another AMM (Anti-Man Movie).In a movie based on contrasting pairs, NYC vies with LA, East Coast with West, theatre directing with movie making, lawyer-free divorce proceedings with lawyer-dominated, in control Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) with her hapless husband, Charlie (Adam Driver). While the leading female characters are portrayed as strong, powerful, determined, funny, talented, competent and winners, the men are generally either rapacious brutes (the LA lawyer, Jay) or self-centred infants. Charlie epitomises the latter: he's really not very good at anything much apart from theatre directing. He's not much good at marriage and doesn't handle divorce well either; he's not much good with practical tasks, such as fitting a child's car seat, he's clumsy, accidentally slashing his arm with a pocket knife, and is even told by the lover with whom he had a one night stand that ended his marriage that he's not good at accepting generosity when she offers more of the same and he refuses.Charlie is not a bad guy but he's a child who needs mothering rather than an adult, a status rather crudely emphasised by the weird 1970s hairstyle he shares with his six-year old son. Moreover, Nicole cuts his hair for him too. I was half-expecting to see her spongeing him down in the bathtub and drying between his toes! Thus at the end of a furious row that, like everything else, goes on much longer than needed for dramatic effect, it is Charlie who breaks down, only to be comforted with a pat on the head by resolute Nicole. And then, in the movie's closing scene, as Charlie is about to take his son for some dad-and-lad time, Nicole notices his shoelace is untied and ties it for him. Gee, the guy can't even lace his own shoes! No wonder he couldn't cope with Nicole.Since the story itself has very little originality, everything hangs on the performances and the direction. Unfortunately, the scaffolding that holds everything together is all too evident. Often one can sense the presence of the director and the cameras lurking in front of the cast and read the directions - 'we need a set piece monologue from Scarlett here with a long close-up'. As a result, there is no chemistry between the leads because everything seems too obviously contrived. Subtlety is certainly not the movie's strong point. The only really convincing performance comes from Alan Alda who plays the kindly NY lawyer, Bert Spitz, a minor character.And then there is the uneasy attempt at mixing genres. In part this is a serious domestic drama with the fate of the warring couple's child at stake. But Baumbach also goes for humour, with some OTT performances from the LA lawyers, especially Laura Dern, and even puts in a song-and-dance number by the triumphant Nicole, her neurotic mother and ditzy sister, and a mournful solo song from Charlie. The effect of this mixture is jarring.Frankly, we couldn't wait to be divorced from this self-indulgent film.

"Good script, ok story, a bit long for the plot. The couples should have had these talks before they got a child, since thats what me and my wife had. Talk about evrtything in your relationship and your marriage will never come to this end. Since I didn't learn anything or had a revelation the movie doesn't deserve more than a 7 rating. Great acting though."
"Everyone should watch ""Marriage Story"" on Netflix. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, soul crushing, maddening, raw & real movie. It was difficult to sit through, we had to stop several times because it made us feel things we didn't know we needed to feel. Some scenes literally seemed like they'd filmed them of us. The acting was superb & the emotion was so on point. It's a love story told in the harsh light of life. Despite not having gone through some of the same things or circumstances as the characters, I related to their words & actions because of having been in the relationship I am. It made me stop & think about how I am as a partner, where I'm strong & where I need to change. I'm glad we didn't see this in a theater because I don't know that I'd have felt so strongly about how amazing it was to see this story captured. It's just real & I feel like I don't walk away from much anymore with such strong feelings."
"This movie shows alot of things..
Please take it.
A great message.. Thank you. <3"
"Noah Baumbach's movies have often been hit or miss, but Marriage Story does feel different as it's perhaps as personal of a story as he's ever done or will do. Beautifully acted and superbly written, you can make the case that this is one of the best films of the year & may win the big prize in February. But perhaps its most impressive accomplishment was being relatable for people who've never been in a similar situation. But Baumbach's script deals with very human issues that create a film that feels like it has real stakes. It doesn't feel Hollywood-ized even though it's based on a famous Hollywood couple. Instant recommendation from me.9.0/10"
