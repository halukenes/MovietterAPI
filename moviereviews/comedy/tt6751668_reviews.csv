Reviews
"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
"I made an account specifically to address some of the critiques I've read. For context, I went into the movie blindly, knowing nothing about it. I came out of the movie thinking it was the best I've seen in a while, and saw it again the next day. Naturally, I took to the internet to see how it'd been reviewed and I was surprised to see some critiques, but I was curious as to what other people caught that I didn't, so I read through them. I kept seeing the same ones over and over, and that led me to writing this review directed toward them.1. Portrayal of the rich family and poor family: I've read critiques about how the movie didn't do a good job making the audience sympathize with the poor family, leading the viewers to view them as criminals/con-artists. I've also read critiques on how the movie didn't do a good job villainizing the rich family and ~SPOILER~ weren't convinced by Mr. Kim killing Mr. Park at the end, feeling like it wasn't deserved. To me, that was the point. That is what escalated the movie to another level. Any movie can portray the poor as innocent/down on their luck and the rich being corrupt and cruel. It makes it easy for the viewer to pick and root for the hero. I think those negative reviews is just a matter of having to sit with that discomfort of not having a clear-cut protagonist.What you have instead, is something more multi-dimensional;you feel sympathy, but not too much for the poor family as you also see the villainous side; how they got their jobs and pushing others out of a job to do so, refusing to help the old housekeeper's husband in the basement, etc.
At the same time, you don't feel like the rich family is overly cruel. They are ignorant and they are naive, but they are certainly not villains; Mr. Park holding saying it's not a test but testing Mr. Kim, his phrase about ""not crossing the line"", and the mom talking about the rain in a positive way, ignorant to others who have suffered because of that same storm. These subtleties were executed excellently. For me, it was a commentary on the system as a whole that creates these economic divides, and the people in these systems may not be necessarily perfectly good or completely evil. If they had done it in the latter way (good v. evil), it would read like any other plot of any book or movie.2. The murder of Mr. Park: In the same line, this critique came from a common thread of people not being convinced that he either deserved to die or that Mr. Kim would do this. I was completely convinced. Mr. Kim had been dealing with the ""not crossing the line"", and the smell of the poor thing that Mr. Park did just before Mr. Kim killed him. Mr. Kim had also just lost his entire place of living and still went to work the next day for a family who was completely ignorant to that. Right before the scene, Park reminded Kim not to cross the line, and Kim listened to the wife talk about the blessing that was this rain, while he stayed up all night in a shelter. In the moment that Mr. Kim murdered him, he saw a man going after his wife, he saw what looked like his dead son, and he saw his daughter dying before his eyes. He also saw a man prioritizing his own son (which we get) and turn up his nose in disgust at the dead man that smelled like Mr. Kim in front of him.3. The ability of the poor family to con the rich family: Many seemed to feel unconvinced at this. I actually felt that it was an indicator of how being smart/cunning doesn't lead to wealth and prosperity. Being poor in their environment means they need to be strategic about certain things, just different things than a rich family would, and that would require skill. If anything, skills essential for survival. To me, this spoke to the lack of opportunity and when an opportunity presented itself, they excelled at accomplishing what they needed to. Based on some of the dialogue in the movie (cake business going under), it shows how sometimes luck is needed, and ability is not enough to become wealthy.4. The idea that this was a movie against the rich: I didn't get that at all. The opposite, really (goes back to my first point). And with that, I want to end with the idea that not every movie needs to have a clear winner/loser, bad guy/good guy. This one doesn't; it has many layers, and it leaves the viewer thinking about it for time to come.Everything else I loved about it (cinematography especially) has already been covered in many reviews."
"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
"This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.If you plan on watching this movie, AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS."
Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.
"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
"This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive."
"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
"Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."
"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"
"Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money."
"This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Yeo-jeong Jo for whom I may confess I have a crush.As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!"
"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.
This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.
In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."
"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended."
"""Parasite"" Review
(10/10)Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."
I have a feeling I won't see a movie this good or affecting for a long time. Funny and scary and thrilling and sad
"Oh man, what can I say...
How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic."
"This movie without a doubt is the best movie I've seen in years. 2019 has been a slow year for movies, and the 2010s in general - jam packed with superhero movies that are all the same and hundreds of sequels. But this movie is quite the gem.It blends comedy, suspense, family, and a little romance in a beautiful way into a brutal commentary of class and society. I'd love to say more but it's better going into it knowing nothing about it so I'll leave it at that.Go see this movie."
"Firstly, movie hype of the wildfire sort (ovation, talk of Cannes, etc) grossly overinflates expectations for a film. If you've read 50 reviews calling something 'best film ever' and then watch said film, I can almost guarantee you will not share their opinion afterwards. No, it's not a flawless masterpiece that will be remembered for centuries - but just because others think so is no reason to hate on it either, since it is undoubtedly an accomplished and entertaining piece of filmmaking.Haters may hate for ideological reasons: something is definitely fishy with the skewed helpful/unhelpful ratio on most of these reviews (it's 1:5 to 1:10 for most reviews), which may or may not point to some sort campaign of orchestrated manipulation, or at the very least an outpouring of emotion. Clearly this has people roiled up!Which is funny, because it's not really all that clear what there is to get roiled up about! Lots of reviewers talk about the underlying themes and motifs and whatnot, vaguely alluding to what those are - class struggle, a dash of political allegory - but no one so far has written up any sort of concrete analysis that decodes the film, pointing out the literary, cinematic, political, or psychological allusions in specific scenes. If you read enough of these reviews, you know there's always at least one arch-geek who takes on the challenge and posts something that borders on coherent and insightful. The North Korea references would be a great place to start, perhaps.But yeah, I suspect this aggravated the sensibilities of some anti-anti-capitalist types, who rail against any lefty do-gooder subtext and want their films all storytelling and no agenda. (This is a silly expectation, since most storytelling throughout history is overtly agenda-driven.) Though it's definitely not a 'pro-capitalism' film, it is quite ambiguous about its morality, and there is no one to really root for or hate. This is actually one of its more subtle but grandiose achievements.More to the point are criticisms of the acting, which may or may not be annoying (I don't speak Korean, so I cannot fully judge). Plot is on the improbable side, although the 'fun factor' of watching this unravel counterweighs the contrived nature of the initial setup. The final stretch doesn't quite deliver (if it did, this would be a 9-10), and there's an unnecessary and rather maudlin coda.But overall, strong work, and definitely one of the year's must-see films."
"A MUST SEE for every cinephile. I finally understood why critics and audiences had been raving about this film. Bong Joon Ho's direction, storyline, cinematography, performances, and use of symbolism utterly blew my mind. My eyes were fixated on the screen and I was sitting on the edge of my seat in suspense for more than half the movie; the suspense was really engaging and enthralling. The touching and melancholy ending, the jaw-dropping scenes that startled, shocked, and surprised me and the effective use of symbolism (such as the scholar's rock and the peach) are some of the attributes that classify Parasite as a truly essential movie. I definitely want to rewatch this. If you don't give this film a positive review, then you don't know true cinema."
"This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent."
"If you're looking for a comedy, brutal, dark and drama movie,this is the movie for you. The way they switched from one genre to another is so smooth you'll enjoy every bit of minute watching it. The whole story line is great. 😁"
"As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite."
"There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket."
"I would like to start out by saying that I am a Korean-American college student (studying at an American college) and have plenty of experience watching Korean movies, including some great ones by Bong Jun-Ho himself, such as The Host, Memories of Murder, and more.A few months ago when the trailer for Gisaengchung (Parasite) came out, I was really hooked; the trailer gave off that eerie vibe (remotely reminded me of Midsommar by Ari Aster) which I found really intriguing. Seeing all the positive reviews on multiple websites, hearing that this film won at the Cannes Festival and understanding the genius of Bong from his previous films, I had very high expectations.Here are some of my main points to why I don't love this movie:1. Acting: The first 10~15 minutes were rather painful to watch. Perhaps it would hit differently for foreigners watching with subtitles, but the unnatural lines and the poor delivery made it really hard for me to focus on the characters. I think the poor acting performance gets better throughout the film, but the Jo Yeo-Jung (mother of rich family)'s acting just felt too out of place and cringey. Perhaps that was the point: to make it look awkward and artificial (especially with the sprinkling of English words) to poke fun at the rich class and their pretentiousness. I understand this is social satire, but the execution was not very convincing. If done properly, I feel like it could and should be subtle yet piercing. I would have had to hated her guts, wanting her to die or her close people to die, but I was barely filled with such emotions. She treats her maid a little too well, and her tone just isn't all that condescending or demeaning. Seemed more like a typical Korean woman freakishly obsessed with her children's education; not a greedy, disgusting woman who doesn't deserve her wealth and privilege.2. Poorly written/Predictable Plot: I don't the writers tried too hard writing the script for this movie, especially in the beginning where Park Seo-Jun (the tall, smart dude who used to teach Ki-Jung, the daughter of rich family) refers Ki-Woo (son of poor family) as a private tutor. Ki-Woo seemed too smooth with it (not to mention their entire family) even though it is implied that he has never done this before (in the scene where he drinks with Park, the ex-tutor). The film makes it seem like Ki-Woo and their entire family are expert con-artists who screwed up rich families all their lives. That transition was just too abrupt and unconvincing with very little build up.Now I want to talk about my main point, and perhaps my main pet peeve about this film: predictability. The element of surprise and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats is what drives us crazy and get excited: questioning every scene, line, action of the characters.However, many aspects of the movie were predictable. I felt like I was always two to three pages ahead of the script throughout the movie: how Ki-Woo will soon bring in her sister after getting the job and thus bring in the entire family; how the rich family will soon return from their camping trip due to the thunderstorm, to screw up the poor family that threw a party in the mansion-ish house. I also do not understand how the sex scene on top of Ki-Tae (dad of poor family) and his kids hiding under the table contributed to the plot. I wish they focused more on the class struggle, the main theme of this movie, and develop on that. The rich dad is the guy who is remotely the obnoxious, successful man who disdainfully looks down upon the poor (bc of his hate for Ki-Tae's smell, which is later the reason Ki-Tae kills the rich dad), but I feel like they could have painted him with a more obnoxious, cunning, and elitist personality. I didn't want or need the rich guy to die at the end, meaning that I wasn't in Ki-Tae's shoes as much as I wanted to and was supposed to, due to lack of character development and build-up.3. Execution: The theme of this movie is banal; but that doesn't matter because I believe execution and delivery are essential elements in story-telling. To bring up Breaking Bad, as much of a masterpiece it is, the plot, although extremely well executed and developed, isn't all THAT ground-breaking. A poor, depressed guy turning the tables around (rather dramatically) is a recurring theme in movies (American dream movies, super hero movies, and more. I am not discrediting Breaking Bad in any matter. The show's plot is unparalleled, not because of where it started but because of how it developed. How Walter became a criminal mastermind. How Jesse became so vulnerable. How the tables have turned so drastically.In Parasite, there is no development nor shock value (especially as to how the poor family will tear apart the rich family, perhaps so because of the title haha). I don't feel connected to the poor family. Their motives are weak and unfounded: they are mere criminals (now I can't say that their financial struggles is deserved or not because that is a whole another issue), but there is just too little build-up. Like I said, they just seem too smooth of criminals who's been in the field for decades.Conclusion: I have been chewing on this ever since I finished watching, but it could be that Bong didn't intend to hit on the points I made; like he didn't feel like he needed to add a strong shock value, or that the poor family needed more build-up. But overall, the plot was too predictable and unconvincing. I saw little pain and suffering of the poor; I wanted to see more jealousy and contempt towards the inequality; perhaps make the rich dad a corrupt CEO? Not just a regular man who's in the tech industry? I didn't feel bad for the poor family, nor did I feel disgusted by the rich family. I didn't think that the rich dude needed to die; I definitely don't think this family didn't deserve that, when in fact I should be triumphantly cheering for Ki-Tae to just go out on a killing spree. Him hiding in the basement was also very obvious. Would have been cool if they didn't reveal that and just show the malfunctioning light blink at a certain pattern, indirectly letting the audience know that Ki-Tae, who was supposedly gone missing, had hid in the basement. Showing not telling (done exquisitely in No Country for Old Men). Instead Bong put a longnarrative in the end which was not inspiring, shocking, nor meaningful. Bong just had the actor explain the whole thing in paragraphs.Proposal/Biggest Regret: Where I think they really could have taken this movie off was when the rich family cancelled their camping trip and came back: the family finding out about how the poor family was stabbing them from behind, and thus the rich family just mercilessly oppressing the poor family with extreme measures. That is the only part where I was curious about what was going to happen. I think that was where Bong could have given us some insight into the cruel, unfair, and corrupt capitalist society that he is (supposedly) trying to criticize and writing this satire about.Just some thoughts. Although I am in the never-ending search for good movies, I am no expert. I was just confused at how ppl thought this is Bong's greatest movie ever or even the best film of the 21st century for that matter.Subpar."
"An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder._________Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look."
"Looks great, smells bad. That's the overall message and reality of this movie. After so much hype and high reviews, it's amazing to see that the whole thing could have been avoided if : a) dude didn't smell, b) dude didn't say that dude smelled or c) dude didn't hear that dude said he smelled. If that's all it takes to radically change your film then you need to do a rewrite. It's not about class, or social blah blah, or injustice or wealth or yada yada yada, it's about smell and this movie is a stinker. Ca pue!"
"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).No spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.If this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own."
"I didn't fall for the hype. The acting and visuals would be close to 9/10. They definitely made the movie. However the application of the story let it down. A lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable.
For example it is believable, very rare but has happened, that someone could hide in a secret area. But definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out. Feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable. But stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world. How many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and don't stab people. And a lot of scenes were bordering on slapstick with out comedy."
"Just like with Snowpiercer and Okja when I think back on this movie I am forgetting it faster than I can remember. There are just too many different Genre's happening here to really give anything any sort of devoted attention.Aside from that my, oh my, how predictable. 15 minutes into the movie I knew what the first hour was gonna be about, and I was not wrong. The second act got slightly less predictable but only because it was really trying to not.It could have been much much better had the finale come up with a more interesting solution."
"This is one of those movies from a director who has done some interesting movies before, which gets a gigantically good rating and seems the overall most well-produced, but is on the whole boring or insufferable, even while at times amusing or properly ""tragic"". The story has elements of crude metaphor, of course, and shows characters, who at first seemed to behave with magical skill, later behave pointlessly and foolishly to get to a dramatic enough finale."
"Comedy and tragedy, the combination of the two is what a Korean filmmaker really good at, and Bong Joon Ho is no exception. Started with comedy, you'll find yourself laughing and going with the flow as the movie suddenly change its color in the middle of it like you have never expected before: the reality of living in poverty in modern world, where one and one's family (and spouses) can automatically be dehumanized by society, with the same level of rats and cockroaches. The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies."
"2019 is truly shaping up to be a special year for cinema, and also contains a large number of Oscar contenders. There's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Tarantino's heavily nostalgic film towards the ""golden days"" of Hollywood along with the old style of filmmaking in general. Then there's Joker, a film that, unlike other billion-dollar grossing superhero movies, attempts to become a serious R-rated character study taking inspiration from older masters like Scorsese. While we're talking about Scorsese, it's worthwhile mentioning that he came out with 2 big movies this year: one being a semi-nonfictional documentary on Bob Dylan, and the other being his biggest crime movie ever, this time breaking form into a less glamorous look at life in the Mafia. With all of these highly critically acclaimed and unique movies, perhaps the biggest ""Best Picture"" contender is coming (for the first time) from Korea.Parasite is Bong Joon-Ho's latest political thriller, and definitely his most complex one yet. Similarly to his 2013 sci-fi film Snowpiercer, Parasite follows a group of people ignoring their standard place in society, and trying to climb up the social ladder to the rich and powerful. Unlike Snowpiercer, however, Parasite's view of social classes is much less simplistic. Using only 10 characters and a single household, Bong Joon-Ho tells an incredibly truthful and realistic portrayal of modern times. The more the family of 4 protagonists disrupts social order, the more they uncover about how society is run.The movie follows many different perspectives of the world, perspectives that other characters aren't aware exist. Mainly, ignorant rich people, and the workers who are scamming them. Due to the increasing amount of perspectives throughout the movie, many normal things begin to seem quite ridiculous. What some characters think of as master plans no longer seem as masterful to the audience, and what are some characters' pleasant memories of harmless fun, are for others' intense near-death experiences. This type of divide in viewpoints both further shows the divide in social classes and creates some of the most hilarious moments in cinema. However, Parasite is not only a satire on social structure, but also one on modern art, education, technology, social norms, business, and Korean politics, making for a story covering multiple aspects of society.While most directors' first foray into another genre is usually noticeably shoddy, Joon-Ho Bong's first primarily comedic film is actually much better than most comedies written nowadays. Instead of taking the modern approach of making unclever jokes and then stretching it out until it becomes painfully obvious to every single member of the audience, Parasite follows the old method of screen comedy used by many early Hollywood writers, and most notably, later by the Cohen brothers. Many segments of the movie will contain multiple concealed jokes in each sentence of dialogue or corner of a shot. While it is true that they happen too quickly and too obscurely for a given audience member to understand every joke, they also create a movie that is much more satisfying on rewatches, or even just in retrospect. 2 different audiences will laugh at 2 completely different parts of a scene. While cell phone use may seem normal to younger audience members, older ones will more easily notice the ridiculousness of them. Korean and American audiences read the meanings of scenes in 2 different regards, with some things only noticeable to one of the cultures. All of this makes for viewing experiences that actually follows the previously mentioned satirical formula of the movie.Aside from (usually satirical) juxtaposition, there is another major technique used throughout the film to make it more intense and interesting. This is tied to one of the movies main messages: that life never goes as planned. This is either hinted at or proven in almost every scene, starting with the first, in which the wife jests to her husband after their wifi goes down, ""What's your plan?"". This line is followed by a shot of her athletic medals, obviously showcasing the fact that her early life plan to become a professional athlete did not go as expected. There are many other lines in the same vein as this one. At one point, one of the main characters blatantly admits their philosophy in life is that ""the best plan is to have no plan"". In general, it feels as though Bong Joon-Ho's technique in writing the more intense sequences in the movie was to make sure that, no matter what, nothing would ever go as planned for any of the characters. This ensured that the audience will always be on edge as to what would happen next, and most of the film's major and minor plot twists or advancements are due to this.I think the best example of all of this is during the sequence when the rich family is out of town. The protagonists expected to be able to relax for the next couple of days, and even talk about what they want to do later in life, like one day being able to buy a nice house just like that one. This doesn't go as planned when the old maid arrives and ruins everything. Later on, the maid and her husband act the same way, abusing their power to relax and daydream about the old days when they felt free and alive. They many references to North Korea, probably hinting at themes that American audience members (such as myself) don't fully understand. Their expectation too goes haywire when the protagonists charge them and take the phone. Another plot twist occurs when the rich family suddenly call the house saying that they'll be home in a few minutes. Another great example of differing perspectives can be found as the family arrive at home to nice meals and a clean house, unaware of all that is happening behind the scenes and that they are in the middle of a fast-paced, intense action sequence."
"I lost interest in this film as soon as the poor, downtrodden family (who I assume the audience is supposed to feel sorry for? I didn't - they were criminals) suddenly became criminal masterminds and were able to outwit the rich, pompous, 'bad guys' (rich family).The plot wasn't remotely believable. In fact, it was laughable (see above).Overall the film was mildly entertaining and certainly 'different' but the plot was entirely predictable, unconvincing, and overly-political.In the end I found myself actually rooting for the rich family. The poor family were bad people. Being poor does not excuse immoral behavior. They demonstrated little to no remorse for their actions and them being poor didn't change my perception of their wrongdoings.They were con-men. They lied, cheated and conned their way into temporary luxury and, in the end, it all predictably backfired. I didn't care for any of the main characters and, whatever political message this film was trying to convey, it's important to remember being wealthy in and of itself doesn't make you a bad person, and being poor doesn't give you a free pass to do bad things."
"I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately. This movie is clearly overrated. For sure, it is deranged and make you feel very uncomfortable sometimes. But for what purpose? I don't know. It proves one thing: that the Cannes festival is a get-together of crazy bonkers who call themselves artists - which clearly they are not."
"After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, the French Oscars let's say, Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city. At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas.Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor.Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control.Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before.Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort. The film focuses on poverty, desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours. Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Bong (Okja) always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase, to succeed in his efforts.Parasite is a mite that doesn't discriminate and will get under every moviegoer's skin, no matter what background you come from. The power of this story, is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller, that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other. This is one infestation you can't get rid off."
"THATS THE WHOLE POINT!
ive seen some reviewers here say that the poor family infiltrating the rich family so easily and skillfully felt like a ""feel good movie"" to let us root for the underdog people and cheer for them when they succeed... the directer clearly intentionally led the plot to be such... so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morallity of the rich and poor families.. Are the rich really ""evil"" for ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them? How people dont get the point of social commentary and only focuses on plot details and improbablity is just sad.."
"Excellent writing, acting, direction, drama, suspense and action. A must see this year."
"Problem with Bong's movies is that they have very strong message. Snowpiercer, Okja, and now Parasite. Problem is that they're Bong's perspectives. And he wants to shove it down the audience's throat. And it's again apparent in this movie. It's painfully clear what he's trying to say in this movie... so apparent that it's immature. He's almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment.And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me. In the old days, movies just told a story. And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different. What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else. Now it's all telling you what to feel and what to think. And this trend is evident in games as well. Before, you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests. Now, the games all tell you where to go and what to do. People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies. It's actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say."
"Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety."
"9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do."
"At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society. Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review.The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other.
Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done.As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts.This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own? Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful. And yet, they are poor. Yeah s. it happens, and more often than not, just because of the way our society works, or rather, doesn't."
"This film begins as a comedy until halfway through when it becomes a heavy-handed drama. Why? For no reason whatsoever.The key moment occurs when a video leads to blackmail. However, the people being blackmailed have a completely obvious response. They can reveal all about the blackmailer's spouse, who is in desperate trouble.At the same time, the thing they're being blackmailed for is minor and the characters as presented would have a good chance of talking their way out of it. Instead, they totally ignore the obvious which leads to the ludicrous second half of the movie.The comedy is now over. Instead of the self-evident continuation of the ""blackmailer's spouse"" dilemma, which would have provided the director's social commentary using a comedy angle, the film reverses direction. The film has the same social commentary as before, but through tragedy and violence.By the end, everything good has gone bad. The Director tries to slightly mitigate it by having a character fantasize about a future that character could never achieve. All in all, a real downer of a movie due to that ending occurring because the obvious is ignored."
"In spite of the excellent reviews, this movie was painful to watch and absolutely repulsive. It got worse the longer I watched. So, what's my problem? I'm a pretty intelligent, educated 75 year old, and I am willing to watch edgy stuff. I can list a dozen edgy foreign movies with subtitles that were excellent, set in Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, and South Korea, etc. There are many moviegoers like me who need a little affirmation of the human spirit in films. This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!"
"This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.7/10"
"A family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of. The inhabitants of the house, on the other hand, are so incredibly stupid that they don't notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell. But the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell! A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB...
It's not just a bad story, no, it's actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn't make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I'm supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn't like them either, I don't see what's so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them ""lovable"". And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting."
"This is my first experience with a Korean movie and I believe that I started with the best.
This movie is amazing very simple but yet full of everything and all kinds of feelings the movie starts as a comedy it ends in a very dramatic way that you could never expect and the transition between the two phases was very smooth.
The acting is very high level not a bit less than all A-list stars in Hollywood.
Everybody must watch this movie."
"I have watched some Korean movies, part of which I genuinely liked, but this one...how this gets an eight star rating is beyond me. I have to admit, that those have been some of the longest two hours, that I have spent in a movie Theater. The movie is neither funny (it might be the dubbing, but I have maybe chuckled twice during the whole movie), nor shocking (unless You haven't seen movies before), it was filled with exclusively unlikeable characters, it was absolutely predictive, drawn out way too long and ultimately was just one big boredom. Yes, it covered different genres, but other movies did the same, just much better."
"Parasite by Bong Joon-ho is like a Hollywood, almost-shallow version of Burning by Lee Chang-dong. The acting is jarring and obnoxious until you get used to it, the characters and plot are one dimensional, the praised twists by the trailers and critics aren't exciting but shallow and even almost predictable. The scenes that are supposed to be thrilling, like the scene in which the rich family comes home earlier than expected from the vacation to the horror of the parasites, are ridiculous in a cartoonish way without anything of value to contradict it. The cinematography and shots are constantly almost awkward in their cheesy-ness and obvious structure. The film belittles its viewers as well, what only takes away from its own intelligence, by feeding them with a spoon its meaning - immediately explaining in words what was already told in visuals, which more often than not was completely unnecessary and dense. None of the characters make any truly moving progress, and even though the director claims in his movie there are no good and bad guys - he mostly failed to translate this sentiment into the film itself by making one dimensional, static confrontational characters.
No matter how aesthetically calculated cinematic shots are, if there is no core-deep meaning in the film to back them up, they're worth nothing. Moreover, you can't calculate emotion. The visual storytelling of the shots in the film is so obviously calculated almost mathematically, with barely no internal intuition or feeling. And it only makes them awkward, as if the director only now graduated film school and wanted to show off everything he was taught without much experience (which isn't the actual case for Bong Joon-ho).
It seemed like the director tried to achieve what Burning succeeded in obtaining, with addition of supposed-to-be-impressive high budget visuals, music and ""show"", but failed. Burning is a fantastic example to a mind and emotion intriguing film, full of thrilling twists and turns, true dark and concerning aura and human characters that touch the core of your being, which doesn't belittle it's viewers and taken straight out of the heart. Burning is what everything Parasite attempted to be without success. Bong Joon-ho thought too much, and ended up with barely anything of actual worth. Lee Chang-dong listened to his heart and intuition, and graced us with a beautiful, well crafted masterpiece, which in its humble and quiet progression spoke volumes and echoed in the viewer's mind and heart.
Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a perfect example to a film which is all bark and no bite.
In one word: disappointing."
"Parasite
Hollywood Theater
11/11/19I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times."
"Bong Joon-Ho did it again. A true masterpiece in acting and storytelling. You are hooked until the end of the story. Then you'll spend at least an hour after the credits thinking about it !
Avoid spoilers"
"A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick, Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre. Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list.If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched.The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems.I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing.Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make.As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie.In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so. Do not miss this movie at all (and bring along a cup of dry ram-don with optional sirloin steak, if you need to).(Watched the movie at Cathay Cineleisure, 2 July 2019)"
"Precise acting,
meticulous editing,
meaningful story,
dramatically funny story telling,
inspiring ending,
unnoticeable yet tangible music,
...multi oscar material."
"I truly cant believe this movie was placed in the same iconic tier as Pulp Fiction and illustrious famed prize of the Cannes Film Festival.Im looking for reasons to love this movie and cant pin anything that made this film stand out.The Beginning: 8/10
The film starts off like any other, everythings going just fine. Then you begin to see how things can possibly get twisted. The director gives those subtle clues when this dark plot may soon reveal itself i.e. the rock, when the english tutor repeats his friend on dating this girl, the art tutor making the son behave out of nowhere and pointing out a mental disability, the ghost and much more.The Middle: 5/10
With all these subtle clues that force an audience to question the ""why"" was...brilliant. But to our dismay, none of these ""clues"" actually lead to anything. They were cheap thrills to pass the time. Horrible.The End: 3/10
Apparently the end was some kind of twist according the raving reviews. Expect the unexpected. I was left in my seat saying ""hmm ok, wtf?"" Yes, completely unexpected as to the driver killing the father. But because he hated the smell? You're gonna have to dive deeper as a writer or director to actually pull any emotion from an audience as to why he hated the idea of him smelling how he did.Nothing special, nothing worth remembering...a come and go film as it is."
"Overrated doesn't even begin to describe this film. I'm a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced, and so it was with this film. Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be  ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get. I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer (paraphrasing) ""a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different"" - yeah, becomes a big stinker."
"If you condone killing upper class employers when they degrade you somehow, no matter how unintentional, then this is a movie for you.The leftist dominated Koreawood has yet again succeeded in popularizing a film that preaches the evil of upper class. This one even goes so far as to teach how to effect subversion: infiltrate the rich and con them any way you can and if things go wrong just end them. The protagonist family of course has no remorse for the afflicted upper class, unlike the empathy they show to fellow lower class people with whom they compete.Unlike in the West, in the Korean penninsula, the cold war rages as fiercely as ever before. In fact, the democratization of South Korea in the 1990s has made S.Korea far more vulnerable to red N.Korean influence than under the earlier military regimes. This vulnerability has manifested itself in the build up of leftist media, think tanks, NGOs, academia and the entertainment content industry. These forces collaborated with already existing comrades in the political sphere to mastermind a coup d'etat in the form of impeachment of the former conservative president Park to install the most extreme leftist regime that is now openly trying to subjugate S.Korea to become a left dominated totalitarian society. Does this sound familiar to what has happened or is taking place in your own country?Now, most people embrace the concept of raising the living standards of the poor and levelling the playing field. But as history has shown, balance must arrived at by social discourse and compromise through the democratic process, not by totalitarian control. The latter only results in a facade of equality of the working class under domination by a new ruling elite in the form of a single party.The movie Parasite is just bad in that it espouses violent and surreptitious upending of the existing order, to the sacrifice of human morals and virtue. In this it clearly follows the blueprint laid out by Marx-Lenin. It is simply a politically motivated leftist propaganda wrapped up in a quixotic adventure that is tailored to penetrate the unsuspecting masses.This ideology war is prevalent everywhere you see nowadays. Capitalism and socialism (and communism) are converging in a close combat spiral of conflict. One can only pray to God to let freedom prevail."
"The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more."
"I generally never watch foreign language movies because I'm annoyed by the subtitles. But this movie hooks you up to the screen with its visuals, the acting, the premise the shifts in the tone, you never know what's going to happen next. I don't understand Korean but still I could connect and realte to the characters.
After watching Joker, I wasn't expecting any other film this year to even come near it. But this came out like an underdog! Both are 10 on 10 for me.
I wish such movies are made more. I hope it gets a dub so that more people could watch it if they are not into foreign films. This is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like Fargo or even breaking bad, it has a similar aura to it.I literally don't have any major critic for the film but if I have to nitpick, I wish the death of Kim's son was real. Because when it was implied at the beginning that he's dead, but the later on revealed that he survived, takes away the horror of that scene.Overall, It's dark, funny, horror and sometimes feels like it's real, what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just don't know it, how many mask they wear."
"Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it."
"Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece."
"I am a fan of Korean movies. Most Korean movies are good. This one is not an exception as to story line and actors. Comparing with the great hits like Along with the God and Train to Busan, this one is less active. What surprised me is that this mediocre get more rating than those great films. Actually, the whole movie is done in a house. I don't know why a lot of people overrate this movie."
"3 observations came to mind after watching this film:When you have a film whose sole purpose appears to be to make some sort of metaphorical analogy of society, you will invariably find gaping holes in its plot, which the director will simply expect you to overlook.There is no longer a ""safe"" outlet where one can find honest reviews of any sort, for any film, including forum sites, where people are supposed to share honest, unbiased opinions. And definitely not this site!The goal of the army of ""recruited"" reviewers is to get you, the consumer, to watch the film. Period."
"This movie is horrible on so many levels, its remarkable: The story/script feels like something a committee of teenage boys constructed during one drunken night, and the execution is mediocre at best (thanks to few OK actors) but overall painfully cheesy. But the true horror is, that this movie received so many awards and highly positive reviews. It makes me question the sanity and taste of humanity in 2019. If that outcome was the intention of the director, then he is a true meta-genius. In summary, skip this movie under all circumstances - its a true waste of your precious life time."
I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019
"Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."
"This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem."
"So, you think you're going to ""fast track"" your way to the good life huh? By taking a short cut here, a little lying and deceiving there.Well maybe.. it seems to work for some, why not for you? (I mean how else did they get there, right? By being honest? ..oh please!)So you decide to take the ""easy"" road. One lie opens one door, then another, and yet another.Things seem to be going so well for you. You're getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices. All of this unearned wealth is just within your reach.
But one night...~~~~~LIGHTNING! ~~~ THUNDER! ~~~~~...comes a flood.And the entire foundation your life is built on, washes away.Turns out all those lies, short cuts, and easy way outs were not good building material.You had the wrong plan. You walked the wrong path. And you made the wrong sacrifices.You thought you were taking the easy way out, the short cut.Look at how wrong you were.In the end, you lost everything: Your sister. Your father. Your home. Your freedom. Your health.Tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out?My god... would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start?I guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow.So today I have a new plan. I will go to university, study, graduate. I will get a job and work very hard. I will become rich. And I will get back the house. And one day, you will walk out of the basement father, and we all be reunited in the sunshine of the courtyard.Until then."
"I have to admit that the main idea of this Korean film is very good. It is different from the majority of the films I have seen, but for me it was inadequate.
The first 40-45 minutes are the main part of the movie. You understand what is going on. The rest of the movie is just a repeat of the first 40 minutes. It becomes boring.
The acting is just good.
Nice effort."
"Bong Joon-Ho, the celebrated Korean director, actually won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite. His ""heroes"" at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.
The inciting incident involves Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he's going abroad and he'll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.
The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.
Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself ""Jessica"" in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park's driver, who's now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces ""Uncle Kim"" to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the ""uncle"" is of course Jessica's dad and he's immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.
The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it's discovered she's allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When ""Uncle Kim"" convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.
Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it's revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there's a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).
When Moon-kwang discovers the new ""hired help"" are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they're simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.
As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is ""permitting the outrage without the consequences."" The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.
A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They're forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.
Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.
But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it's been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park's reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.
Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he'll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.
Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet."
Film does not have a mouthwatering end or twist to cover up the slow and quite obvious build up. Story line is quite simple and nothing really boastful is out there. There are films made before and will make after this on the same story line.Film is categorized in Comedy category but it does not have any justifiable point to prove it belongs to that category. Comedy is visible only in some here and there scenes and actors/actresses really failed to maximize the comedy factor. Story line and acting both should be responsible for average comedy in the film.Camera Direction seems to be a quite successful area in the film. Director has managed to capture some really nice angles and views to catalyst the current scene. Final scene where camera comes down through a window of snow can be cited as an example.Costumes are pretty good and did not actually disturbed the viewer to immerse mentally into the fictional scenes. The chosen luxury house is also great and it always have that rich cliche in it. Fantastic work by the directors to nail that location.I am 50% alright with the movie but it is average in the sense of story line and acting. Its average guys not poor so jump in and see it for yourselves. It would not be a waste of money for sure. Entertainment wise I m not sure everyone will enjoy it like a 10 star movie.
"Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.This says a lot about this one.Don't miss it."
The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.
"Ranks as one of the best films I have ever seen and I've seen many .Very clever , unusual story it's about as original as a film can be , it totally lacked the predictability of most US films.Don't miss it"
