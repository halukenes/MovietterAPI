"""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I've never quite seen before. We're presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character's motivations. It's obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it's constructed. One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they're in. That's not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It's a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don't miss this one."
"Frances McDormand is, without question, one of the very best actresses of hers or any generation. Wow! And like most of the greatest she goes for characters who don't ask for sympathy. The truth is in her eyes, always. So, naturally, I followed her every inch of the way. She is surrounded by a fantastic group of actors. Woody Harrelson is just extraordinary but perhaps the biggest surprise is Sam Rockwell making his one eighty not just believable but very moving. Martin McDonagh's writing is the magic potion that keeps everything together and when I say everything I mean everything. Humor and horror as if it were practically the same thing. The dialogue is brilliant and Frances McDorman deserves the last paragraph. Her face is a wonder. Superb performance. Don't miss it."
"When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.But a great story isn't necessary grand on the outside. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like a tiny rabbit hole size of those three wooden screens, but stick a head in - and you'll see a huge empty space laid with people's sorrow, guilt and regret. And that emptiness sucks you in and leaves no way to stay untouched.But there's also hope. Hope for justice. Hope for retribution. And maybe even hope that it's still not too late to change something, or to change yourself. That nothing is absolutely black and white. That even in the darkest moments of our lives there's some room for a sense of humor, maybe a sad and bitter one but still one worth a warm smile.This world is a crooked place, where crime often goes unpunished. And Peter Dinklage's small role in this film, as a reference to another not so pretty world where the ""happily ever after"" way doesn't quite exist, is a stinging reminder of that. TBOEM does not, however, try to pull the magic sword out of the stone and go crush the wicked and protect the righteous. Instead, it shows that sometimes, crumbling under the weight of the evil things that fall on us, we lose our own limits and become those who sow evil ourselves. Anger does beget even more anger.And maybe the reason that makes America great indeed is that, with all the messed up stuff happening without and within, it's in your culture to value forgiveness, something Christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends to listen. To suffer without guilt, yet to offer a helping hand to your offender when he's down and wounded. To break the circle of evil and help each other wake that yearning for decency that everyone has inside them, albeit dormant sometimes. Forgiveness is tough, and, just like revenge, it doesn't bring back the things - or people - we've lost. But at least it helps to hold onto what could still be here.Yeah, it's just a movie, and most people aren't as deep and philosophical as the movie characters can afford to be. But if some unrealistic complexity (and sometimes even wisdom) of the simple people could make some real regular people on the other side of the screen stop and think over their own real regular ways, maybe that's exactly what we need from time to time. Because life is still here, and so are the multiple choices it gives, And which road to choose today, we can still decide along the way."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.Writer/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn't one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.Basically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that's coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. For the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. It seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you're laughing, it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.Also, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a clich√© one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+."
"Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.Three Billboards is a dark but also funny and heart-felt story about one woman's quest to get justice for her daughter's rape and murder. After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.The thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.The performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases."
"Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is disgusted that the police haven't found her daughter's rapist and killer, so she takes out billboards asking why the chief of police, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) hasn't done anything about the case.The billboards set off anger, violence, and revenge motifs in this small town. Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops."
"Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? Three giant billboards THAT close to the road and THAT close together - I've driven all over the country and never saw that. Billboards in rural areas tend to be smaller and definitely not that close together for obvious reasons. WHO is this woman, Mildred? We know literally nothing about her beside the fact that her daughter was murdered. Eventually we find out she's divorced and has a son who lives with her, but if one is to care about the protagonist, character development is crucial. As it is, it's interesting to watch her do and say crazy stuff, but I couldn't care less about her.WHY is it, two male characters directly related to the protagonist have a girlfriend & wife 20+ years their junior? Do they live in a part of the country where such a thing is commonplace? What are the odds of that? Probably about the same as if your dentist won the lottery but then your mailman did also. Yes, possible, but very, very odd and distracting.Why does Willoughby's wife have an English accent? Was he in the military and met her while overseas? Is it common for a small town in Missouri to have British accented residents? If there was ANY character development, maybe we'd know these things. As it is, it's distracting and elicits questions that shouldn't have to be asked. $5000/month for three previously forgotten about, decrepit billboards on a road people don't use anymore? LOL. For someone who is supposed to be a savvy, tough, non-nonsense older lady with the wisdom of the Buddha, that's pretty dumb.A cop smashes office windows, assaults a man and throws him out a 2nd story window with no jail time. Really?! Why does Willoughby have fatal cancer? Seems as no more than a cheap device used to heap more disdain on Mildred. Yawn. Dixon ends up in the same hospital room as the man he assaulted? Is that supposed to be ironic? And again, what are the odds? Mildred firebombs the police station, nearly kills a cop, and then just says ""I didn't do it"" and that's the end of it?! Really? Some creepy stranger visits Mildred in her store and harasses her, THEN is overheard in a bar talking about committing a crime, maybe the crime in question, but alas even after Dixon cleverly retrieves dna from the guy, it turns out he's not even a local, and wasn't around when the crime occurred. Why then does the creepy guy know so much about the crime in question and WHY is he harassing Mildred!?!?!?! WHY?Then to top off ALL that nonsense, Dixon and Mildred decide to go murder the creepy guy anyway, LOL, how profound."
"The actors are superb, but the script fails in several ways. My immediate reaction, seeing the opening shots, was that this was not Missouri. I guessed it to be the southern Appalachians (where I have spent a lot of time), and so it was. The characters did not behave or speak the way real Southerners speak or behave. Martin McDonagh has written his fantasy of what he thinks Southerners are like. He got it wrong. He works in film sort of the way D. Trump works in politics--he shocks, he amuses, he appeals to our base instincts. But he doesn't tell a coherent story. The central characters are not sympathetic, and indeed they are borderline sociopaths, including Frances McDormand's character. Sam Rockwell's ludicrous cop character would not be tolerated, even in small-town South. Viewers are left to wonder why Woody Harrelson's wife is a much younger luscious babe with a foreign accent. (Also a real Southern man, even a lout like Harrelson's character, would not use foul language in front of his two small daughters.) The period was not clear; observing the cars in the film it seemed to be the 1980s or 90s. Yet there were no computers seen in the police headquarters of the advertising company office. Yet near the end McDormand uses her cell phone. Other reviewers have noted the recurrent racism of the screenplay. I kept wanting to get up and walk out, but stayed for a simple reason. As with any whodunnit, I wanted to find out who did it. Guess what? McDonagh never lets his audience know who did it. As author he must know, yet he keeps this information to himself."
"I will say that I enjoyed this film, mostly due to Frances McDormand's performance. It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I'd have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can't explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.--Most strikingly the (deputy?) Chief Dixon violently attacks Welby, busts his face with his gun, throws him out of a window and proceeds to kick him while he's down, all in eyes view of the new Chief Abercrombie. Sure, he gets fired. But not arrested? Not even sued?--And as for Abercrombie. He shows up the morning after the previous Police Chief died and declares that ""they"" sent him as a replacement. They who? Is there some force outside of Ebbing that dictates who their police chief is? That part really didn't make any sense to me. Also, replacing one of the main characters halfway through the film, a character we're starting to get to know, with a stereotype that we don't know anything about, was rather odd.--Someone lights the billboards on fire. But apparently only the paper on them burns, not the old wood that's been sitting there decaying since the 80s, because they are able to paste duplicate posters to the existing structures without any problems. That's laughable. That old wood would have been a pile of smoldering cinder.--Mildred is portrayed as such a tough-ass, assaulting a dentist, kicking children in the crotch (with no repercussions I might add), storming into the police station spouting vulgarities, but when she's confronted by a guy who suggests he's actually the one who killed her daughter, she freezes and seems helpless. One might say the fact that she didn't go psycho in this scene is what makes this screenplay original but someone else, like me, might argue that it's just out of her character and doesn't make a lick of sense.--Chief Willoughby for some reason is an old geezer but has a young, attractive Australian wife. He also has two young girls. Yet he's completely vulgar around them. While instructing them about a game of fishing he invents, he calls the blanket they are sitting on the ""god-dam blanked""--twice--to little four or five year old girls. He says to his wife later that it's her turn to ""clean the horse *hit"" out of the barn. OK, I actually have quite a bit of experience tending horses. It's not called ""*hit"" it's called manure and you wouldn't even call it that--you'd just say ""clean the barn"" if you really owned horses. The writing of his character, other than the scene between him and McDormand while they were sitting on the swings, was actually horrible.--Mildred burns the police station down, throwing 5 Molotov cocktails out of the still broken windows of the advertising agency across the street (not boarded up by then?). And the new Chief just accepts the explanation that she didn't do it because she was with James. No more investigation. Ho hum. Police station burned but oh well. And then a few scenes later, Dixon is apparently in the suppose to be burned down police station sitting there having a conversation with the new Chief.--Dixon is a complete jerk to the bone. He gets a letter postmortem from the now deceased Chief. Suddenly he's a good guy. Yeah right.I could go on and on with this but I'm afraid my word limit here is going to expire soon. I'll still give this film a 7 star rating because I DID enjoy watching it, but the writing here is really not all it's cracked up to be. It does feel like it's a big novel with a lot of twists, but in retrospect it's more like a parody of a big novel with a lot of twists, and the twists don't make a whole lot of sense."
"First, let's all just accept the premise that police beat up random black people for no reason whatsoever. Also, police are inept, because they can't find someone to arrest for the murder and rape of your daughter, even though there is zero forensic evidence. Next let's take a moment to reflect on the time you told your daughter ""I hope you get raped on the way too"". Now it's time to start lashing out at the world because you are angry. Start by committing 2 felonies against a dentist. It's also a good idea to go into a police station and tell them what horrible people they are. When your signs get set on fire, climb onto one of the burning signs and stand at the top of the flames. Next, fire-bomb a police station, because you are still mad, even though there is still no evidence or suspects. Finally, if you can't find the actual person who committed the crime, instead go murder a complete stranger on a hunch. This is all very profound and heart-wrenching...can't you tell by the music?The police chief isn't so bad though, because he has cancer and is spitting up blood. He thinks it's best to leave the hospital, because what do doctors know about dealing with cancer. He doesn't want his wife and kid's final memories of him to be slowly dying in a hospital, so instead their final memories will be of him blowing his own brains out in the barn. Thankfully, a streetwise black police chief came in to take over for the inept and racist white police officers. Now things will finally get done."
"It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."
"I can understand how one can adore this film. Of course it had some very interesting ideas and tried to make certain points, but in the end it was a tonally indecisive mess. Here are some of my main reservations: - The script is overexplanatory and relies too much on coincidence, while it plays down the consequences the main characters would have in real life, when acting nuts. I dare you to go burn a police station down, remain at the scene (regardless of the fact that you are virtually the only suspect) and tell me what happens afterwards. Yes, I know McDonagh would have argued that we shouldn't take the movie at face value, but there are too many -and too important- plot holes to forgive (and this is not a buddy cop comedy for god's sake). - In a cringeworthy flashback scene, we see the mother and daughter quarrel about Angela going out, only for them to prove their precognitive skills (Angela said she hoped she would get raped on the way, and Mildred agreed with her). Well, I'm positive there were more subtle ways to show why Mildred is filled with remorse. - I thought Rockwell's character to be too cartoonish at times. McDonagh said that they had to cut a lot of material because there were tons of moments with Rockwell's character that were too comedic, but there are still many way over the top moments left in the movie. - Willoughby is portrayed as a genuinely decent guy. Honestly, I don't get how can a Sheriff let his racist officers deal with black people the way they did and still qualify as a good person. Supposing he was an ignorant, illiterate redneck, I would be much more willing to excuse this kind of behaviour."
"Seriously, any critic that says this movie is somewhat good, should chance his job. Is the acting great? Yes
Is the story-idea great? Yes
Is the execution great? No way. It almost never happens that i yell at a screen in anger because a storyplot is so unrealistic that it hurts. But here it happend. The scene where Officer Dick throws out the advertising guy of the window and then just sits within his station, nobody arresting him, not even the new Chief that clearly saw it and fires him would arrest him - well, this is just not even in the united states of police brutality realistic and just ruins the whole movie for me. From there on, the movie was just a pain. And im almost never not on the line of critics...dont understand it."
"This movie is so obviously trying to be edgy & artsy, it might as well have had someone walking out with a sign at key moments- ""laugh here"" ""gasp here"" ""tear up here"". I love the actors, the characters were super colorful & the movie wasn't boring. Other than that, it felt like someone took a template of a dark comedy & then just left out the realism. Going out on a limb here but I'd say people don't normally use the F word & C word that often. Policemen don't act like that ...and still have a job. Assault, arson or attempted murder are causes for arrest (even for cops)People don't let their friends do jail time for the sake of leaving signs in the street (that was a friend, right?)That 19 year old girl would not be attracted to the exMaking fun dating a little person might have been funny 20 years ago (and then his enlightening 'look in the mirror' speech as he left the table was ... meh) Also, that was quite a 180 for the vicious, racist cop who throws people out of windows. Too many unrealistic situations & reactions. And why did that random suspect guy come into the shop in the first place? Did he rape someone in Irag? And throw a turtle in there while you're at it.Sorry, love the premise, love the actors but sometimes I think critics just have a checklist they go by."
"The good: performances by Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell, and Lucas Hedges (despite not having much screen time.) There were some moments that were pretty cool and did some new things, but overall this film isn't worth much. It is basically a string of mean people going along and doing mean things, to no end. Nobody learns anything, the little growth that does occur is quite forced, and a lot of it doesn't seem very grounded in reality. The tone is confused, bouncing back and forth between Nickelodeon comedy and a dark drama, making it hard to take seriously. Woody Harrelson seemed to care so little about his voice-over work in the middle of the film, but that's understandable when the writers didn't seem to care much either. The editing wasn't great and offered unclear communication at times. I don't know who picked Abbie Cornish for this, or anything, as she is an exceptionally poor actress. I think we're supposed to be emphasizing with the main character, but that's hard to do when she's a callous wrecking ball. Making a film about a parent dealing with trauma of this nature is a great premise, but there's a certain humanity lacking. I disconnected with this film when she didn't take the billboards down the moment her friend got arrested. I assumed it was a given- how could you let your friend rot away in jail while this futile ploy of yours is the single cause? And how was the friend OK with that upon being released? This is not a strong person, this is a petty and immature person who is seeking solace purely for selfish reasons. It is also completely overlooked that she is harming her still-alive son throughout the course of all this. Finally, we have one scene with Mildred's daughter, who is the cause of all events that take place in the film. Not only was the actress incapable of carrying this scene, but it was also hard to believe she was the daughter of Mildred. Overall, an unaware film that seemed to try to be catering to the current political climate."
"The drama of Martin McDon, known primarily for his ability to violate the foundations of modern drama, can easily be considered one of the best in the outgoing year.In the center of the picture is the mother of the deceased girl, seeking justice and justice in a rather cynical manner and the unquenchable hope for which is the meaning of life, along with a single son and a worn blue overall.""Where is the cliche?"" - I thought, and already on the 10th minute of the movie I stopped speculating about the development of events and trying to predict the replicas and actions of the characters. This unpredictable plot was not in my memory for a long time, considering that all the events taking place for nearly two hours (and there were an unlimited number of them) surprise with their surprise and sometimes absurdity.The non-linear structure of the film makes the viewer systematically ask the question, ""What will be the end?"", But ""What will happen tomorrow?"". The same question is asked to themselves and all the characters: the divorced mother Mildred, who is already desperate to find justice, ultimately lives by today and actually loses the intelligible for herself and for the surrounding purpose, humiliating the policeman and accusing them of racism, sexism and other "" "". Sheriff Willoughby, who learned that he has cancer, does not know what will happen to his reputation after his death. The sheriff's widow does not know what will happen to her daughters. The assistant to the sheriff Dixon sits up his pants and reads comics, having no motivation, no prospects, nothing.The appearance of three billboards in Ebbinge literally leads this small town into a rage. The hunt for Mildred is accompanied by violence on the screen, both from her side and from her ill-wishers (scenes in the dentist's office, as well as in the advertising firm). Even the church involved in the scandal gets gets on the forehead of Martin McDonagh, who calls her ""a criminal group"" and ""lovers of little boys, and in general, boys."" The whole town shows all the dirt, like a fish, rotten from head to tail, stinks of hypocrisy.Thus, the unyielding willpower of the heroine Francis McDormand and her motivation, which at some point is questioned, makes the actress, perhaps, the main nominee for the Academy Award. And the abundance of all sorts of characters (including the hero of Sam Rockwell), well-designed, but sometimes fantastic scenario and satire on acute social problems (racism, sexual harassment, police lawlessness, etc.) make the Three Billboard reflect modern disgusting reality and valuable ( if not the most expensive) coin along with Bruges and the Seven Psychopaths in the treasury of the talented Martin McDonagh.Bravo, McDonagh!"
"I really wanted to like this film. But it has plot holes you could fly a 747 through. The characters do completely nonsensical things. And for the love of God, if you're going to make a place a character in your movie, at least actually film it in that state. Like maybe ... I don't know ... In Bruges?"
"This movie I went into almost blind, but I came out of the theater with it probably being my favorite film in the last year. This film is so smart at being able to keep you at the edge of your seat from simple things that they plug into the film. Heartbreaking and tense situations in the first half of the film come back in some shape or form that leave you questioning what is going to happen. There was genuinely no predicting what the characters were going to do and how they would react to certain events. This unpredictability doesn't just apply to situations, but possibly more notable in character arcs. Without giving to much away, there is a character in this film that does everything possible for you to hate them in the first half, and by the end of the film you are rooting for said character. There's times where the characters that you cared for are becoming real and dis-likable in certain scenes, but to the point of more so being genuinely worried about how their choices will affect them.Every actor in this film did so tremendous as well. I really can't think of an actor or actress that outshines the rest. But if I had to pick favorites, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were just that. But a lot of that just has to go into the writing of the characters themselves. The cinematography in this film allows the actors to take advantage of facial expression. There's a scene relatively early in the film that is mostly sitting and staring but the actors have such convincing movements and gestures, it goes to a point where you don't need dialogue to tell what they are feeling and what they are thinking about.Really the only issue I have in this film is some scenes felt a little unnecessary. Can't give away too much without spoiling, but in a film where every character goes through in arc, there's one character that is just there to break tension and crack personally unfunny jokes. But this character did not affect my score and they were barely in the film.I highly recommend checking this out."
"What a movie and what great acting. Frances McDormand has done amazing job and deserves awards for playing Mildred Hayes. Although a very serious subject, this movie is a comedy.The punch lines are to the point and absolutely hilarious. I went to the Toronto International Film Festival to watch this movie and boy, do I consider myself lucky to have decided to watch it.The story, screenplay, direction are amazing. After The Grand Budapest Hotel, this movie comes as a breath of fresh air."
"Combine the quirky characters of the master of quirk, Wes Anderson, and sensibility of adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director Quentin Tarantino, and what do you end up with? The year's most overrated ""black comedy,"" Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the work of playwright by trade, Martin McDonagh, who's been quoted as saying that he prefers writing for film over theater (why couldn't he stick with the stage if that's his primary area of expertise?).McDonagh's strategy is to appeal to both liberals and conservatives but in the end he remains squarely in the liberal camp. He serves up absurd characters that appeal to the baser elements in our culture but infuses them with ""hearts of gold"" so they appear to straddle both liberal and reactionary fences, but actually exist in none.Take for example his main character, Mildred Hayes (played by a haggard-looking, one-note Frances McDormand) who puts up the three billboards outside of town, frustrated by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his small town police department's inability to catch the man who murdered her daughter seven months earlier. The foul-mouthed Hayes functions outside the law and McDonagh throws a bone to reactionaries, asking us to approve of Hayes' desire for revenge and endorsement of vigilantism.McDonagh's other rebel is Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a racist who tries to top Hayes in her quest to be the top-rated anti-social misfit in town. First he arrests Hayes' co- worker pal Denise on trumped up marijuana possession charges and after he learns of Sheriff Willoughby's suicide following the revelation of a cancer diagnosis, he goes after Red (the man responsible for renting the billboards to Hayes) and throws him out a second floor window (instead of arresting him, the new black police chief merely fires him! What's up with that?).Just like Hayes, Dixon finds a scapegoat to assuage his guilt over Sheriff's Willoughby's death. When Hayes finds her billboards ablaze, she naturally pins the blame on Dixon and firebombs police headquarters. It's at this point that McDonagh rather simplistically attempts to redeem his protagonists. The saintly, all- knowing Willoughby, in a letter he leaves for Dixon after his death, reassures the errant former officer that he's not such a bad guy after all, provided that he gives up his bigoted ways.After Dixon survives the firebombing at the police station where he went to read Willoughby's letter, he decides to help Hayes after overhearing a potential suspect who might have killed her daughter. During a fight with the suspect in the bar, he manages to obtain the man's DNA. In an original plot twist, the DNA does not match and the potential murderer is ruled out as a suspect in Hayes' daughter's death.With Hayes apologizing to Dixon for the firebombing of the police station (she escapes being charged aided by an alibi from a dwarf who lives in town), the two vigilantes make their way to Idaho to seek revenge on the now ruled out suspect in Hayes' daughter's death, as they are convinced he's guilty of other crimes of rape, and deserves punishment.McDonagh, however, is uneasy with the idea that Hayes and Dixon would actually go through with their extra-judicial act-so he throws in a caveat. As they're talking to one another in the car, it's probably the unheard voice of the goodly Sheriff Willoughby which is still in the air. Hayes and Dixon express doubts about actually going through with the plan-the implication of course is that they will not engage in another act of violence-that they in fact have ""learned their lesson,"" and now are ready to act as law-abiding citizens.It might be reassuring to a liberal audience that the bad guys suddenly become ""good""-that there is a measure of redemption for the two who have become unhinged by the deaths of people close to them. In reality, vigilantes remain vigilantes, and such reversals in outlook are highly unlikely. But even if one accepts the improbable Deus ex machina, McDonagh's willingness to excuse all the prior bad conduct, suggests a crack in the screenwriter's moral compass.Ultimately, McDonagh wants his quirk-fest both ways. He revels in the bad acts of vigilantism, appealing to the aforementioned ""baser instincts""; but offers up redemption for his bad actors, in the form of a martyred lawman, who like a saint from above, offers words of wisdom for the ages."
"I wanted this movie to be great. It wasn't. The performance by Frances McDormand is good but not great. She's very good at showing overwhelming anger, but that's all she's allowed. Her character never gets the chance to breathe. Blame the script, not her--she's a terrific actor, but this is a one-note performance.2. There is a sub-theme about race. Race is an important issue and deserves to be treated honestly, but in this movie, it felt like a side-road that led nowhere. (It actually feels like moral preening on the part of the scriptwriter. It didn't add much to the movie's meaning.3. Wonderful performances by Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell as a police chief and officer. Woody especially brought grace to a character who at first seemed unsympathetic. (BTW, McDormand's ex-husband has a young and beautiful girlfriend, and that relationship is treated as awkward and shameful. Harrelson's wife is young and beautiful, and that relationship is treated as idyllic.) 4. Police officers don't talk like that among themselves or to others.5. I particularly didn't like the Chief's take on racist cops, saying essentially that all cops are racist. That may be accepted as dogma by some Hollywood screenwriters, but any chief who talks about his beloved employees--or cops in general--like that shouldn't be a cop. Coming from this character, the sentiment is cheap and clunky and inexplicable.6. There are a couple of plot holes wide enough to drive a billboard through sideways. The most egregious (no spoiler here) is what happens (actually what should have happened but didn't) immediately following the window scene. (You'll know the scene when you see it.) The thing not happening was necessary keep the plot going. Everything that happened after that feels tainted as artificial and contrived. Likewise a later scene in a bar, involving a coincidence beyond coincidence.7. It's impossible McDormand's character wouldn't have been arrested several times in the course of the movie, for several serious crimes. Once again, he plot depends on that not happening, and thus the plot again is contrived.8. There's a letter delivered to Rockwell's character late in the movie which is full of Hallmark Card sentimental drivel. It can't be justified by either what we know of that character or what we know of the writer.In a world (as the movie trailers used to say) where we are awash in numbskull comic book movies and incoherent special effects spectacles, it was a small miracle this film even came to my local cinema. Too bad I couldn't love it."
"I went to see this movie because I hadn't seen any trailers to it. It's something I do because trailers are unreliable and spoiling, but also this case was based around the sheer number of good reviews. I can't even describe how surprised i was when i started to invest in the drama, and I really got my money worth when seeing it in the theaters. This is a movie that grips you good from the start, and holds the tension of the backstory right up until the end. The characters are phonemically written, and the actors did a hell-of-a-good job portraying them. This is a movie that could have been written off with a ""strong protagonist""-cinda-story, but unfolds to a much more deep and philosophical tone. To be honest! not much happens in this film, but because of the powerfull characters within - every little detail about their lives, becomes of great importance throughout. I can say without a doubt, that this is my favourite movie of the year (2017...Ofc.)"
"it's unfortunate to use the word comedy, dark or otherwise, with regard to this film. unpleasant would be a better adjective. if you've seen the trailer you know what the billboards are about. if not, you'll know when you see the movie. revenge and guilt are being served up cold. deep down, apparently, every one has a heart of gold. racists, wife beaters. whatever. I did not buy it. others have."
"Slow but not boring. dark, intense and complex and not predictable. incredible cast but still felt realistic. powerful and engrossing but not a feel good film"
"I've never had such an unpleasant feeling watching a movie before. The characters are awful people, sociopaths even. Frances McDormands character at first comes across as just being a broken woman, but a flashback scene shows that her character was never a pleasant person. Her ex-husband likes to poke fun at the towns little person like he's still in junior high. Sam Rockwells character is the worst. He tortures a black kid, punches a young lady in the face, throws a city clerk out a two-story window for no reason at all. But yet, the writers thought that his character needed a redemption angle. Are you freakin kidding me?? His character belonged behind bars. Aside from this, the script was just awful. People talking in ways that people just don't talk. Things thrown in there that didn't make sense. Why was this military veteran from Idaho, who had nothing to do with the girls murder, and who's never been to Ebbing before, just show up and start harassing a dead girls mother? Also, the characters in this movie do things that would ordinarily land a person in county jail, or even prison. But, they go completely unscathed. But, lets not ignore the biggest goof of all, the wife of Woody Harrelsons character suddenly out of nowhere develops a British accent.The producers must have spent some good money on fake reviews, because I can't see how so many film critics can find this movie to be great."
"Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement. The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred's son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother's foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the 'town midget' whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn't a weak member in this extraordinary cast. This is one of the best films of the year, despite the subject matter at the core of it."
"I want to love this, as I get the main premise. However, there were a lot of quirks that just didn't fit. Things that didn't scan. Prime example was Sam Rockwell's character, office Dixon. It's like they tried to paint him as a one-dimensional, racist bad guy who redeems himself, but then add more layers that didn't really add/take away from him. Just filler for no reason. And what he does should have gotten him arrested not suspended. Unrealistic.The dad was just dumb, but then they pull back on the throttle and he's okay. Then he's a dick again. I get that the writer/director is trying to add depth, but it just came out as confusion over the character and his motivations. Him saving the file was stupid. As stupid as her burning down the cop shop and him beating up the ad guy.Honestly, I rooted for Mildred the least. I found her to be the least sympathetic character in the entire movie, and she was a mom who lost her daughter to a horrific crime. I get it, it changes you and a person who goes through that will never be the same, but damn. I found it almost impossible to root for her. And her little dumb conversations with her slippers and dear? Not cute or informative. Just dumb and it made the character look nuts.I rooted for the sheriff the most. Here's a good cop who really wanted to solve the case and bring in the bad guy. Not for Mildred or himself, but because it was the right thing to do and it was his job. The dynamic of him having incurable cancer was interesting, and the one time I actually liked Mildred was during their interrogation scene when his cancer interrupts his smug ""gotcha"" speech. She's so awesome to him and he to her. The one true, shining moment of humanity in this. The movie would have been better served telling the story from the sheriff's point of view and ending with him.6/10, but that's an aggregate. There were some real 1/10 and 10/10 moments."
"If this movie is considered not only to be entertainment but a work of art worthy of cinematic awards and an endorsement of Hollywood's encouragement for more like it to be produced then it's a sad day for the industry. I found it to be nasty, ugly piece of work that sets out to portray men in the foulest light possible for no better reason than to play to the current drumbeat of every social movement wanting to distance itself from Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump.I can only guess the claim to being a 'comedy' albeit a black comedy, is to justify a certain degree of satire in stereotyping the white guys as racist, mysogenists on the defensive against the unexpected attack of the movie's downtrodden feminist principle character.The fact is, ordinary people do not act or talk the way these characters do. The dialog is devoted to extreme expletives raging on in hate for each other and proving and achieving nothing in the process. Ironically the result is extremely racially offensive and sexist and even manages to be debasing to dwarfs; and for this trash they award oscars?"
"I went to this movie expecting good things after it won several awards and was so highly praised. Frances McDormand succeeds in making a woman whose daughter was raped and murdered be completely unsympathetic. I have seen a few plays written by Martin McDonagh so I know he can be dark but come on..........do people in the movie business really think everyone in flyover country is a rube, hayseed, racist, wife beater? Do teenage boys regularly call their mother ""cunt"" to her face? On what planet do these people live? I have a suggestion for Hollywood film-makers who want to show how sophisticated and edgy they are. Make a movie about Harvey Weinstein and all his Hollywood cohorts who turned a blind eye to his antics."
"A truly weird experience: incredible acting performances in an incredibly bad script. Yes, it's unpredictable but it's also totally unbelievable, with forced plot twists and character arcs which make no sense. And when Frances McDormand starts monologuing a CGI female deer, all residual good will goes up in smoke just like the billboards.
McDonagh has nothing to say, just like in the execrable but well-acted In Bruges. He prefers shock value over good storytelling, character development and depth. Unfortunately the Oscar success of this misfire means we'll be subjected to his 'art' for a long time to come."
"If it wasn't for the big names to carry this movie it wouldn't deserve a third of the critical praise it has received. I can't even fully describe to you, dear movie goer, where this movie is flawed. First of all, these characters in real life wouldn't talk like this. The vast majority of middle America doesn't curse this much in regular every day life. There isn't a lot of ppl that live in small town USA that walk around dropping a GD and an F in casual conversation at the dinner table talking to a priest, at the dentist office, sitting on a swing talking to a cop dying of cancer. That was the first major problem I have with the story. Like seriously WTF? The characters have no authenticity to them. And in a movie where character development is key, I found myself struggling for resolve. I mean the woman's daughter was raped and murdered for goodness sake. So that's major issue if you can't find something else in this woman's life to identify with. Furthermore, I can't help but wonder if making this a fictitious town was intentional or if the director actually wanted to use the town that they filmed in but city officials vetoed that once they heard the dialogue. Honestly you're better off watching an episode of Dateline and then following that with the Departed. Those 2 things make more sense than this movie."
"It's exceedingly rare that I hand out 10s or 1s -- I reserve these for the perfect, and perfectly hideous, and neither is easy to come by. (I also elevate a score when something is of the ""so bad it's kind of great"" variety, like ""The Room"" or ""Oogieloves and the Big Balloon Adventure""). ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (which is one of the most awful titles in ages) is that rare find: something perfectly bad with zero redeeming qualities.The plot seems to hinge on a woman hellbent on finding the man who raped and killed her daughter -- ooh, a revenge mystery! Actually, this crime, like everything else in the film, is just a self-consciously writerly device to get people to bloviate in the same tone with each other on sundry topics that have nothing to do with the crime. There's a deep well of syrup and cornball below the acid river of misanthropic shit that flows through every scene. There isn't an ounce of sincerity in anyone's relation to another -- it's all pure manipulation, formulaic broad strokes that in every aspect have been done better 100 or 1000 times already. Lots of decent actors have ""big moment"" cries, but it's all empty, hollow-ringing verbiage. Had I but world enough and time, I'd gleefully dissect this abortive mess, and I concede this is more an ""F-U"" to the director/writer than a review, but I already feel my life wasting away minutes as I contemplate this execrable film past its due."
"Saw this in a theatre. Very entertaining film with relevant social issues. The film deserves best film Oscar n Rockwell best supporting actor.
The best part about this film is the character development and the awesome ensemble cast and their performances. 
Frances McDormands performance is solid but Sam Rockwell cannot be ignored n Woody Harrelson is always a treat to watch.
Another great aspect is the writing. McDonagh did a terrific job. He tackled the films serious dark material very well n made the film bearable to watch by adding enuff humor, unpredictability, tension n beautiful locations. The editing n cinematography is good too. This film was captivating n mesmerising n not at all slow as compared to most Oscar nominated films.
Havnt seen the directors previous films but will definitely check it out as after watchin this film i can b sure of em being good."
"Billboards set ablaze but apparently the only thing that burned were the plastic wraps.....silly.What was the purpose of the conversation with the priest? How did what happened to her daughter have anything to do with Catholic priests molesting alter boys? And in a small southern town, what was the likelihood the lead character was Catholic.....seemed agenda driven to me.A cop beats up an innocent citizen and throws him out a window yet his only punishment was losing his job? How was he not immediately arrested and thrown in jail.....mind boggling.A woman firebombs a police station and there is no investigation. The new cop sent to the town just accepts the statement of the local town dwarf and life goes on.....hard to believe.Why did the stranger go into her shop if he had nothing to do with the murder? If this man was out of the country and had no association with the Sheriff why would he care about the billboards?......Illogical.The movie was watchable until Woody Harrelson's character kills himself.....the movie dies at that point as well."
"This movie had some funny parts and the story was intriguing, but nothing irritates me more than when a movie doesn't end. It just cuts off and doesn't complete the story. I screamed ""What?!"" at the television when the credits rolled. It seems more and more movies are doing this and it's just frustrating. I'll leave the thorough reviews to the professionals, but I needed to warn anybody else who enjoy movies that actually finish the story."
"I am completely baffled by the positive reaction to this movie. Comedy? No, sorry: grief, racism, cancer, suicide, rape, murder and assorted other antisocial behavior, not funny. The unintentional (?) irony of using a term like ""black comedy"" to describe this movie makes me throw up a little in my mouth. I am a huge Frances McDormand fan (and appreciate her performance here) so I'm very reluctant to infer that all this nastiness was intentional, but I don't know how to make sense of it. Intentional or not, it's repulsive and infuriating.Just one example among many, but for me the straw that broke the camel's back: the racist cop unambiguously commits attempted murder of one character, who happens to be white, then cold cocks a female witness. (This last, shocking detail is apparently considered trivial by the writer/director of a movie whose PREMISE is the rape and murder of a woman, since it's never mentioned again.) The attempted murder is eye-witnessed by the new chief of police, who happens to be black. (So edgy!) Bizarrely, the racist cop is not arrested, though minutes later he's ordered to turn in his gun and badge. For what reason? The script is such a mess that it isn't even clear whether this is because of the attempted murder (absurdly inadequate) or for sassing the Chief (under the circumstances, ridiculous, and... what EXACTLY is the movie trying to say here?). The new Chief ignores/forgives/understands the attempted murder because the racist cop was upset? He thought firing him was more appropriate than arresting him and charging him? Oh, it's a COMEDY so we're not supposed to dwell on these kinds of details? Hell no, that won't fly, not in America in 2017, where racist cops murdering innocent people because they're ""upset"" is no laughing matter at all. I'm almost as troubled by the awkward attempt at ""balance"" (I guess?) when Frances McDormand's character essentially commits an act of vigilante terrorism on the Police Station, almost killing someone in the process. The ridiculous ending made me think of Trump: there are fine people on both sides. Nope. I'm not having it. This movie is disturbing. Boycott this crap."
"Wow...I am stunned and shocked to see the 8.4 rating this film received.The film had the potential to be truly something powerful.1 - Powerful subject matter (rape, racism, police corruption, toxic masculinity) You name it this film really covered some of the most poignant and important topics in American society, yet marginalized every single point it was trying to make. 2 - Superb Cast (4 A listers, Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage) You could not have casted better for each role (besides Sheriff Willoughby's strange English wife WTF???)3 - Location / Cinematography / Soundtrack (superb)4 - Story (A mother posts billboards on a deserted stretch of highway to encourage the local police force to solve the horrific rape and murder of her daughter)
 
Because of the nonsensical plot twists, the inplausible and impossible coincidences and the flat out bad writing and bad acting this movie simply blew it.Fails:1 - Woody Harrelson's character explains to Frances McDormand's character in the first ten minutes that they have done everything in their power by cross referencing the DNA samples found with databases nationwide and that there were absolutely no leads. Therefore her persisting in keeping the billboards up just doesn't make sense...2 - Why didn't the cops just deface/destroy the billboards from the beginning if they were so corrupt and didn't give a shit about the rule of law???3 - The dentist who just happened to be one of the people complaining about the billboards insists on pulling out FM's tooth without even looking at it. She then proceeds to drill a hole through his thumb.4 - Woody committing suicide. At that critical point in the film with the billboards and him showing only the first signs of even being sick. The guy is the chief of police and the entire town thought so highly of him. NO WAY he would just kill himself like that.5 - The conversation Woody and his wife had on the couch was just way too dirty and bizarre and why all of a sudden was she speaking with a British accent???
This just completely through the film out of sync.6 - The scene with the surviving daughter was just contrived and bad and made Frances just look like a horrible mother.7 - The breakfast scene the next morning and her ex-husband overturning the table while the 19 y/o girlfriend looks on...8 - Sam Rockwell smashing the front door, beating the advertiser, breaking the window, throwing him out the window, assaulting the secretary, and again beating the advertiser in plain sight of the soon new to be African American chief of police who does nothing. Rockwell is not arrested and sits at his desk while the film cuts to a news report about the chief's death and if the billboards may have contributed to his suicide.9 - The news inferring that there may be a link to his death and the billboards paid for by FM's character. No news outlet would actually have said something like that for fear of being sued.10 - The new chief of police taking his sweet time to enter the station and only after what appears to be half and hour or so dismisses Sam Rockwell from his job.11 - Who the hell helped clean up all the broken glass and monitored the situation which was happening just outside the station then??? All the cops were inside the station as if NOTHING had happened.12 - Some random guy coming into the gift shop to threaten FM's character, saying that he wished he could have been the one to rape her daughter. Ends up he was nowhere in the vicinity or even in the country when this happened. How does he know where to find FM? Why doesn't she chase him down or at least get his license plate number after he leaves. To top it off she's saved by the late sheriff's wife showing up to deliver a letter left by Woody.13 - The billboards are burning down when FM and her son drive by and they conveniently have a 50 gallon fire extinguisher in the front seat..14 - SR just happens to be in the police station when FM decides to firebomb the station from across the street. She tries to call the station to warn him to get out (Call trace???) But then just decides to set the station on fire with SR inside. Then conveniently Peter Dinklage's character just happens to be walking by and then becomes FM's alibi and then agrees to go on a date with him.15 - FM & PD go on a date at the ""nice restaurant"" in town and her ex-husband and his 19 y/o girlfriend just happen to show up.16 - SR is out of the hospital after maybe 24 hours after having ""severe burns"" and decides to go for a drink at the same exact time as FM's colleague who he had arrested & the billboard guy and to TOP it off the random guy who might have raped her daughter are all in the same bar. The random guy is bragging about having committed a rape just out of the blue when SR is sitting right next to him and then when SR goes outside, comes back, he finally asks if that guy has been sitting behind him the whole night... SR was like 6 inches away there is NO WAY he didn't know he wasn't there... Then all of a sudden when SR goes to the bar the guy acts like he has a big problem and they get into a big fight where SR decides to scratch the guy to obtain a DNA sample instead of simply calling the police and at the very most detaining the guy until the police arrive.Probably one of the biggest stupid parts of the entire film. Seriously 4 linked characters all randomly showing up at the bar. The guy admitting to a rape in public very well knowing someone is right behind him. A cop who had just read a note from his mentor saying he knows he has the potential to be a good police officer and he goes and does something as stupid as that... MOST IMPLAUSIBLE SCENE EVER !!!17 - The new chief of police informs SR that the DNA was not a match and the guy was not even in the country but in a place that was sandy.... WTF is this about? Just poorly written and absolutely does not make sense that that random guy was even in the town to begin with.18 - FM & SR decide to go to Idaho to track down the guy because while they may not be able to solve the case which actually means something to them, that guy was probably a rapist and deserves to die to...Good luck finding him in Idaho being that he was just in your town a few days ago. Yeah ok....What a waste. This film truly could have been something which raised real questions about the role of the police force in society and how corruption, racism, sexism, homophobia are being addressed in rural communities but nope it just turned into the biggest laughable POS in recent memory.Don't watch this film."
"It's like McDonagh started writing off the top of his head and whenever he got stuck just kept adding outlandish twists. Then, presumably very high, he read the resulting first draft mess and thought, 'I'm ready to shoot.'How does such a naked emperor wander around hoovering up praise and awards? I have no idea. But don't shortchange yourself and feel you have to go along with it. This film is really bad. Really really bad."
"Really ? This is a comedy ? In what universe this is considered funny ? I'm not sure but perhaps , rape , murder and battery is very funny in some parts of this planet . Do cops really acts this way in USA ? I'm one hundred percent sure that they don't.
And yeah guess what attempted murder and arson are real crimes , hell they are felonies yet characters in this ....ah very artistic movie do them without any consequences . And for Gods sake , joking about midgets is so not funny , it might have been funny in medieval times , not any more . Very bad very very idiotic , if this thing wins any Oscars , i will set up three billboards reading : 1 ) After almost one hundred years of movie making 2) still confusing absurdities
3) with edginess ? How come Hollywood ?"
"How in the world did this get any Oscar attention??? The story line was so bland that the dry comedic effort of the writers was the only thing that made it worth watching all the way through. So the above board story line is that a mother is angry and distraught at the lack of effort being made towards finding the killer of her daughter. She pays for some billboards towards that effect. The billboards cause a lot of friction in the small town in southern Missouri where she lives. And around and around it swirls.... For nearly TWO HOURS!Now here is the story that Hollywood really wants to tell you. Everyone who lives in small town Midwestern towns is dumb, alcoholic, and incredibly dysfunctional. Well everyone is provided that their white. If you live in a small Midwestern town and you're black, well then you're a well balanced, hard working , decent person with good common sense.Of the 50 or so characters seen in the movie, I recall three were black. They were the only characters that exhibited any intelligence, decency and good common sense. Every single adult character that I recall otherwise was portrayed as having at least one version of a serious flaw in their character. They of course were white.I hear the lead actress got up on stage at the Oscars and went political. I find that funny given that her character was probably the most flawed in the movie. Her character was unreasonable, angry, violent, and generally unloving.
Overall the sociopolitical undertones of the movie were irritating. So grateful that I didn't spend a dime to see it."
"I watched this movie after having heard a lot about it and I was a bit disappointed. Maybe it is because I was tired, but I feel asleep several times.
The storyline is interesting but low and the message is intense, important, but already heard in many other movies and books.
Violence creates violence, only forgiveness or the ability to leave things go can stop the circle: it is absolutely true, however we already know it.
The picture of the United States in a quiet small village is maybe too negative and exagerated, the total opposite of some american comedies in which everything seems perfect: here everything seems corrupted, violent, full of anger and hate, hypocritical.
Maybe this movie has been overrated by the critics?"
"I don't get the praise being heaped upon this film at all. Yes, Frances McDormand is great. Yes, Woody Harrelson is great. But, overall this film came across as a bit of a mess. It seemed like the script was written in one sitting by three guys drinking beer:""I know, let's make the woman firebomb the police station! That'll be great!"" 
""Let's throw in one scene of the daughter just so people know she was pretty.""
""We'll add a clever twist so people think this nutcase is the killer, but, wait for it.......HE'S NOT.""While the film strives for realism in most everything, it destroys that by the insane actions of just about everyone around. A cop thrashes an innocent man in front of the whole town. A grieving mother firebombs a police station. Abandoned billboards on a barely used section of road cost $5,000 per month?The Academy can throw all of the awards they want at this thing, but I think Woody Harrelson did the right thing. He blew his brains out just before this film got really stupid."
"Folks, if anyone doubts that Hollywood and big-city liberals despise ordinary Americans, have them watch this sorry excuse for a movie. It's overflowing with all of the typical insults and egregiously bogus misconceptions of rural life, especially that of the Mid West.As for the movie, it's a mess from start to finish. The story line is full of billboard-sized holes and is often unbelievable to the point of frustration. The casting is awkward; the characters are loathsome, the gratuitous profanity is appalling; and the ending is just plain lazy.Avoid this social-justice garbage ...and the people who promote it!"
"When I entered the theater I had not checked the director and writer for this film in maybe a week, so I continually asked myself if it was a Cohen brothers film, which to me is bad when it's actually written/directed by someone else. I think that there is a difference between paying homage to artists and downright imitating them.The protagonist (who is played by Frances McDormand) is presented to us a likable person at first. But when she speaks to the police about her problems she seems quite nazi-esque. She wants to draw and test blood from every person who lives in her town to find a criminal. When the police chief informs her that such a thing is impossible because it would be a gross violation of people's civil rights, she doesn't care. He replies, ""he could have been a man who was just passing through the state."" ""Then let's take blood from everyone in the country."" Sure... She says it quite seriously. Repulsive.Woody Harrelson provides good acting, but there are multiple scenes in the movie when he does voice-over for comic relief that are mildly amusing at first but feel stale and forced rather quickly. There were many times when I just wanted to shut it off-- when someone is stretching irreverence out to the point of being unrealistic and absurd it's just bad writing. It's also bad form to have so much voice-over in any movie.In the early going, Sam Rockwell's cop character is the type of person who would strike me as reprehensible yet tolerable. When he pistol whips an innocent man and woman then beats the man to within an inch of his life he goes from tolerable to I-want-this-moron-to-die. As other people have noted, the police chief (who witnessed all of these things in person) wouldn't just fire such a person. He would be arrested and convicted for attempted murder. Instead, the chief fires him in an almost nonchalant manner.There is also an additional embarrassingly stupid scene in which Rockwell's character thinks that he is overhearing a violent criminal brag to his friend about his crimes. When the criminal confronts him... he scratches his face... then stares at him. Again, the Rockwell character is borderline retarded, but even the dumbest among us have a survival instinct. When I saw this scene play out I thought that it was part of a strategy or plan-- the Rockwell character wanted to get the guys arrested for assault so he could make his case to the police chief. Nope. Just more idiocy.It has a few solid comedic moments. But I would never watch this film again."
"I live in the great state of Missouri and have never encountered any of the ""ist"" characters portrayed in this heavily flawed film. You name the ""ist"" word and it is portrayed by all except for the minority actors which are also dishonored because of their stereotyping in this movie. Horrid condemnation by Hollywood of the ""flyover"" part of the USA. They still don't get it."
"I read many reviews of this movie extolling its many qualities. I read that it won two academy awards and was nominated for many others. I watched the movie yesterday and cannot recall being more disappointed in a movie for which I had such high expectations. I will avoid being specific (consistent with the rules for writing reviews on the Netflix site), but to say that the storyline for this movie is ridiculous is being kind. This movie has been described as drama and dark comedy. It is neither. Rather it is an amalgam of extreme violence, course and foul language, misogyny and bigotry, all designed to push the envelope just a little further to satisfy an audience that apparently is no longer sustained by subtlety and a well constructed plot line. In a day and age when everything has to be ""in your face"" to gain attention, this movie delivers. The plot, which is in addition to being downright silly, inconsistent and contradictory, delivers no discernible denouement. Perhaps the writers found that at the end of this train wreck there was nothing of consequence remaining to deliver as a conclusion."
"This is movie is so overrated it bothers me. How did we get to this point as a society where this is ""one of the best movies of the year""?Please don't pay to watch this movie if you haven't already. It was worth watching to realize how far we are off right now as a society.This is not the brilliant dark comedy that everyone wants it to be."
"SPOILERS!I hated this shockingly racist, illogical, trashy film! I am stunned that it is not being called out for the racism (hidden behind the mask of alleged liberal good-deed-doing) and violence that it condones! I have never seen a film make so many attempts at virtue signaling while at the same time exhibiting racism all over the place. Frances McDormand alleges about some torturing of ""innocent black folks"" and yet that storyline is never explored. Sam Rockwell (so awful in this I need to invent a new word to describe the failure) plays a racist cop but we never actually SEE any racism - there is only innuendo and excessive, unfunny use of the ""n"" word. Racism, if you're going to explore it intelligently with an audience, needs more than mean words and one scene where a ""racist cop"" get annoyed with and threatens to take in a young hipster black man for spitting in the cops direction. Sadly, that's the best example of something mildly racist actually happening in the film besides cheap talk - and it's WEAK - because frankly the cop, dumb as he is, actually has a point in that spitting towards a cop is an act of aggression - the cop didn't arrest him, he just reminded the young man that he's walking a fine line. Every black character (all in minor roles) portrayed seems to have stepped off the train from Williamsburg or Wicker Park. They are ALL hipster types with nothing of value to contribute besides cheap talk. The black people in this movie exist only to make the fake liberals look good for having ""black friends"" somewhere in the background. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION - WHY is Frances McDormand the star of this film? Why not ANGELA BASSETT? Instead of casting a white actress why didn't the filmmakers decide to make this story about a Midwestern black woman who's daughter's rape and murder was ignored by the cops? That would at least be a more believable attempt to explore these themes - rather than FILTER THAT MESSAGE through a white woman. Hollywood is racist and they almost always think white liberals need to save black people. Is it about racism, or justice for the dead daughter? Neither, ultimately. As for her dead daughter, she's abandoned by the storytellers so...WHO CARES? The violence is stupid and LOOKS FAKE! Example: that dumb kitchen scene with the boy and his dad and the knife! Embarrassingly executed - almost as embarrassing as that REALLY bad CGI DEER that is just a knockoff scene from a superior scene from THE QUEEN. ALSO --the message of anger begets anger, etc being explained to us directly from a character is cheap writing and disingenuous. There is no good message here. Also, why the making fun of the midget? Gee - that hasn't been done thousands of times! Stupid. Not funny and NOT edgy. BASIC PLOT FAILS! #1. They introduce a man who ""MAY"" be the killer Frances is kinda searching for (more time is spent kicking high school kids in the shin - by the way, why did those kids just STAND there and let her keep kicking them? Not a very realistic reaction. They would have RUN AWAY!) He MAY be the killer - and then we learn he definitely is not? And why give us this whole story about him being somewhere ""SANDY"" in the war? So he's a rapist soldier now instead? So WHY show him CONFESS to Frances earlier? STUPID!#2. THE BILLBOARDS DON'T WORK! We see NO ONE drive past them EVER except for Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody. As for the news broadcast, that was again cheap writing. It doesn't show us how people react to anything related to the billboards. Woody's cancer is a cheap diversion from the fact that the billboards have no affect. By tying his cancer so directly to the plot with the billboard's ""alleged fiasco"" they deny the opportunity for the audience to see the townsfolk real reaction to the CONTENT of the billboards - and instead they react to Frances being mean to a dying man. This defeats the point of the billboards in terms of storytelling, so it's hard to see any real reason why or how these billboards EVER stir the pot, but the filmmakers pretend that magically they do! # 3. When a hipster gets thrown out the window by Sam Rockwell - the new police chief sees this - and, uh, DOES NOT ARREST HIM! So, not only do the filmmakers know nothing about police, what is legal or illegal, but they have never watched a single episode of LAW AND ORDER or even JUDGE JUDY. Speaking of reactions - no one in this film has a realistic reaction to anything that happens ever. Sam Rockwell goes from nearly murdering someone, to acting goofy after getting fired, all in the same breath! It's stupid beyond belief. Then we're supposed to believe that during THE FIRE, just SECONDS AFTER reading Woody's moralistic letter (another cheap devise overused throughout), he has an instantaneous change of heart/moral epiphany and thinks immediately of saving the BURNING CASE FILE ON HIS DESK to help Frances McDormand? I could go on for hours about how awful every second of this film is...save yourselves the time. Watch ""IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT"" or ""MISSISSIPPI BURNING"". This movie is so awful it does not even deserve to be criticized. The only reason I am is because it has gotten rave reviews from critics DESPERATELY searching for a zeitgeist film of the moment, but who haven't found a good one yet so they are propping this one up! WHY? Because it checks off all the correct virtue signaling requirements of the times. Critical thinking while viewing this film will reveal a false justification for violence, bigotry towards dwarfs and country people, and inherently racist storytelling."
One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Waaay too many cuss words & the story line was all over the place. I want to be entertained not work trying to figure out where two hours went!
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a different take on a crime/drama film filled with bits of dark comedy. What stood out for me in this film mostly was the acting, it was phenomenal. Frances McDormand plays this strong independent woman who fights for what she believes in. She does a great job of coming out as a cold person with no fear. Sam Rockwell stole the show for me, he brought most of the humor in my opinion. Overall the film had a thorough and entertaining plot which had you captivated, especially once the movie picks up pace. Someone in this film definitely deserves to win an oscar, whether it be Frances McDormand for best actress or Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor. If you despise drama films, I would skip this, if not, watch it and you won't be disappointed."
