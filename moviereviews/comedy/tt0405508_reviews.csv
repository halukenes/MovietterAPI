"Paint It Yellow. Oops.that's suppose to be Rang De Basanti.. Well that's exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today, us and our present, yet the similarities we have from the Pre-independence era. The Gen-x who knows Mac-D but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs, couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama.. No no no.. Rang Deis a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection, a food for our thought process. It makes us think, as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, ""I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing"". That says it all Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.Rang De  is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it ""There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them"". I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow "
"The movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clichés, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed."
"It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work, they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion, when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more, the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh, Amir Khan, and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera-work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers, but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt, the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use, in my opinion, being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these ""leisure"" rides and early in the second half. But, besides that - the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such, but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends, of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers, there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number, but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure, white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference."
"If I wait any more to say all the things I want to say about this great soul-stirring movie I will never be able to say it.It is the best use of the film medium that I have seen in a long long time.Here in the west we have virtually abandoned good cinema.Where are our Capras,our Wilders, our Hitchcocks, our David Leans? We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year."
"Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.The movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace"

No wonder... it gives you real life look.."
"Film ReviewRang De BasantiIndia AwakensBy Nidhi KathuriaRating *****'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go', this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan, 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. Rating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding"
"I have watched this movie today on the Republic Day of India, and I was really left speechless with the movie. It ranks among the very best movies. The movie has brought out the best performance from each actor. The movie has a very realistic look to it. And to add to the credits for the movie, the direction and the camera angles are simply mind-blowing. I don't think anybody will be satisfied with watching the movie just once. I think the movie is simply EXCELLENT. All those of you who haven't watched it, please do so. The topic that the movie covers is very much relevant and is something that is going on these days in our country."
"Aamir strikes back guys. Its the movie of the year. Simply amazing performances by all. Though i felt that the movie dragged just a little bit in the beginning, the second half was amazing. The movie begins in a very light manner and gets takes a serious turn in the second half. It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system. The performance of Soha Ali Khan was better than I had expected. I specially loved the manner in which the historic events were shown. A truly amazing transformation of normal college students into rebels. Miss it and you will regret it."
"The movie is a blend of few many good things. The best thing about the movie undoubtedly is the comparison and shift from past to present. For people who thought old values are not for modern days, this sure is an eye opener. An excellent music background score by A.R.Rahman. the cinematography is so damn realistic. Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to. Siddarth might have done a bit of over-acting. but the sensitive Aamir Khan is at sheer acting epitome. Expecting this to be nominated from India for Oscars. Unlike Dil Chahta Hai it is a more heavy and thought-provoking movie sure to rise Nationalist spirits."
"Warning: This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer, I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully, I was wrong.One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen, it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However, it falls under one category perfectly: Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries (the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel) as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our Pre-Independence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out (especially in the Post-Interval Portions), it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. The Story: Sue (Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role) is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie (Aamir, Siddharth, Sharman Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie, she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. (Aamir).Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot (R. Madhavan) whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's (Mohan Agashe) accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man, woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. When they succeed in their endeavour, they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this, they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.Analysis: The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.Apart from the main story, there are a number of sub-plots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country, it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist (Anupam Kher...wasted) and Ministers. The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye', 'Paathshala', 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like:1) D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2) Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3) Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4) the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.However, what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be non-existent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi, but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also, absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. One the whole, this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought. Also, it is one of those few movies that actually lives up to its tagline: A Generation Awakens."
"Movies we view come and go, releasing from our minds; however, this particular movie left behind a mark in my heart. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message, and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences, ministers, corruption, unemployment, etc...Yet, rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong, and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society, and change what is erroneous. EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique - the screenplay, the colors, the performances, the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles top-notch. Every actor had an impact in the movie, and should've received equal credit from my perspective. Amir, Sharman, Siddharth, Kunal, Atul, Soha, Waheeda, every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over looked,such as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work - her Hindi was very well fluent, and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Soha's reaction after Ajay's death was natural - she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor, and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day, he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir, as usual, did not disappoint. He was awesome, and very authentic. The movie was modern - so today, and it was something that we can easily relate to. Honestly, when I first purchased the movie last year, I thought it was an over-rated movie just because of Amir Khan's comeback; nonetheless, after watching it, I was proved wrong. It was just ""wow"", beyond words. I couldn't manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely, and has the possession of very deep meanings.Overall, this movie deserves a 10, without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there - change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS, however all other countries in south Asia, which contains issues such as corruption, over population, and so forth. I am a Bengali, and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian - because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the country's money, and they are not caring about the people, or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day - due to their very actions. It taught me that we should do something about my country's political groups, and Prime Ministers. WHOEVER DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE MISSING - go watch it! =D."
"This year gets a perfect start with Rang de Basanti...A movie that is so contemporary...After movies like Dil chahta ha, Black this one really hits me as something new and something different..to start with the story and direction is avant grade and not to forget the acting which has been outstanding...the story has been well thought out..the characters well skated as perfect as when they die in the end the casualness that they depict touches your heart...things they do in the heat of the moment becomes a realization that even they are unaware of and then the big one the climax...many didn't like it..But i just loved it...Bollywood has to learn from this movie to make climaxes like this..the back ground score is outstanding and needs a round of applause..and the cinematography is an institution for aspiring cinematographers....the movies ends on a sad note and still leaves you with a smile...believe me very few movies make that happen... Once again Amir has proved the fact that he is a rock solid actor and the new bunch of actor are a boon to the film and hats off to Rakeshy Mehar for giving us those goose bums and those moments of pride and realization in a much more contemporaries style...It sure did Paint my heart yellow"
"The tag line of the film says it all, A generation awakens. This is an attempt to awaken the generation X to the reality, to encourage them to make a difference without giving lengthy lectures and preaches on patriotism and nationalism. So, does the film succeed in doing so..?? Well to a large extent it does. The film manages to invoke the feeling for the nation without any heavy dose of loud hardcore patriotic dialogues. The film is a good mix of fun and message. It delivers the message without loosing the essential fun factor. Amir Khan's one liners keep you alive all through. As expected Amir Khan steals the show but the second leads stand out as well with some good performances. Cinematography, direction and screenplay are of first grade. This one also marks A R Rehman's return to form with some marvellous songs and background score. I would have rated it 10/10 only if the climax was handled a bit better. The end of the story leaves a lot to be desired and the moral of the story is not very clear by its climax. A genuine, honest and good attempt nevertheless. See it and feel good, feel proud and feel moved."
"The movie is one of the marvels of the Indian Theatre ,beautifully blending historical flashes with modern settings .All aspects of the movie including acting,music,cinematography are excellent and it is a must see for ones who are looking for an ""out of the box"" movie.At the same time I would like to say that I personally am not in favor of the ending.I feel that is a very wrong message that the Indian youth is getting.The idea of trying to wake up the society with extreme measures is inappropriate.Killing people is never a solution for any malice that is ingrained in the population.The same idea during the independence revolution was totally different and i respect that totally being a strong patriot myself but the movie is a bad example for the young people who already have fire in their blood and cannot think rationally.The movies have a great impact especially on young people and many try to imitate them.If a system has to be changed it has to be done by intellectual stimulation and general awareness not killing ""the bad guy""!.We have to teach our youth the same thing. Having said that I would like to say that the director definitely has the right to project his thoughts but I differ about the message the movie gives and thought its worth sharing my ideas with everyone."
"RDB is the rise of a new genre of films for today's youth that will be hailed as one of the all time classics. If Yuva was the ignition RDB is the Spark that lights the fire.A script that is almost flawless and executed with unimaginable comparisons to the pre-independence era is extremely hard to portray. Also to grasp the audience by the throat from the word 'Go' in this over critical world is stunning.I've watched RDB about a dozen times now and I must say it is equally powerful for the message that needs to be conveyed regarding ""doing"" rather than ""gossipping"" and ""being a spectator or passenger in the so called 'system'"". We have all been there, we have all done it and are still doing it but RDB makes you more than just aware of it.A virtual tag line ""Koi Bhi Desh perfect nahi hota, Usey Behther Banaana Padtha hai"" is quite adorable and delivered by different personalities with exactly opposite ideals, at different times in the movie. Was it right to eliminate a bad powerful person? Maybe Not but it is definitely a way to get the QUICK attention of the ever so unfocused youth of India, myself included.R.O.P.Mehra has presented RDB for the youth and done full justice to them. At the end of RDB, one definitely feels that he has had some kind of rub-in with the government regarding MIG's. He seems to have put his heart and soul into RDB. I wouldn't be surprised if his closest kin was one of the pilots affected due to bad parts in the MIG's.Aamir Khan as DJ (short for Diljeet) has essayed a role that is funny yet focused, comic yet concerned, silly yet sensible and a loafer who becomes a leader. The complexity of this character is probably lost because of the ease at which Aamir is able to become DJ. Being a Bombay-ite to transform into this ever so likable Dilli-ite with that awesome Punjabi ""oye pehen de takke.."" transformation was dumbfounding. On the other hand he is Chandrashekar Azard. No Doubt.Siddharth as Karan Singhania & Bhagat Singh is a revelation. A calmness shown by him breathing life into a character who just ""Loathes India"" and becomes the voice of the 5 man ""Rebels with a cause"" is sometimes too hot to handle. The emotions and the sincerity of the character are given more than enough respect by Siddharth. He will go a long way in handling intense roles very easily.Soha Ali Khan as Sonia urf Durga Bhabhi is fresh and practical. She does have lots of similarities to Saif Ali Khan but still stands out as her own woman, not just a Sharmila Tagor or SAK clone.Madhavan in his short role as Lft. Ajay is very effective and has a magnetic presence that the group of friends look up to. His chemistry with Soha is simply natural.Sharman Joshi as Sukhi has perfect comic timing and is a great sidekick to DJ's jokes. He does show his ability of serious shades when the film turns into a ""fighting for a cause"" saga from a light one.Now, the newcomer that I think will get a lot of looks due to his personality and charisma is Kunal Kapoor as Aslam. His difficulty in dealing with a petty family clinging to old virtues and his loyalty to his friends is just too perfect. His physique can only add to his characters in the movies to come and he could be the perfect raw material for directors who want the next ""Angry, Sensitive and Sensible"" young man.I just hope RDB does not stay just a movie but truly awakens India. This one is a 10/10 for sure."
"Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra merges two plots in RANG DE BASANTI. The first is about a group of friends, their bonding, the carefree lifestyle they lead. The second plot pertains to the past, when freedom fighters sacrificed their lives during the era before independence. Mehra draws parallels between Indians ruled by the British and Indians ruled by corrupt politicians today. The message is subtle at first, but echoes piercingly before it reaches its finale. The transition of the five friends from meaningless to meaningful existence is done brilliantly.Rang De Basanti has a story to tell, is not a ripoff of some exotic film, but the story is told at a leisurely pace. Is it a patriotic film? Yes and no. Is it a fun film? Yes and no. Is it a serious film? Yes and no. Does it have a neat ending? Yes and no.Thats the beauty of Rang de Basanti. Its the film which shows that bollywood is indeed coming of age.A R Rahman lives to his reputation in Rang De Basanti. Binod Pradhan's cinematography is lyrical, and Adman Prasoon Joshi evokes the youth lingo with his dialogues. Sameer Chanda's art direction and Allan Amin's action sequences are its other strong points.Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end, but the film has more gems when it comes to performances: Siddharth is excellent, Atul Kulkarni is fantastic, Soha Ali Khan is a complete revelation, Kunal Kapoor is natural and Sharman Joshi delivers a powerful performance.Alice Patten is brilliant and besides delivering a flawless performance, her style of speaking Hindi is sure to win a lot of hearts. Madhavan is likable. Waheeda Rehman is graceful as ever. Both Om Puri and Anupam Kher don't get much scope. Kiron Kher is exceptional yet again. Mohan Agashe, Steven Mckintosh, K.K. Raina and Lekh Tandon are adequate.But ultimately, despite sharing the screen space with others, this is an Aamir Khan film. And the actor, playing a character 15 years younger, lives the role, conveying the right amount of mischief (as in the banter in Hindi with Sue without realizing she knows the language), carefree flippancy, earnestness, insecurity, even breaking down on screen, and keeping his infectious laughter till the very end.Well, in the movie its said "" I always thought that there are two kinds of men; those who met their deaths screaming and those who die in silence. And then I met the third kind"" Similar type of feeling triggered in my mind too, There are movies made with some moral(some underlying message), some are pure entertainers, not making much sense. Yesterday i came to know about the third kind...........that leaves you with a thought, a thought..................."
"Rang DE.. turned out to be as colorful as its name with shades of reckless youth to the maturity of the subject it wishes to project. The comparisons drawn between past and present and the way the characters really emerge out has been the high point of the movie.Aamir khan looks more mature than a college pass out but then he makes up with his fine performance and instinctive manipulation. It is a patriotic movie and relates well to the younger generation.I would definitely rate Alice's performance among one of the best and how she's so much comfortable with Hindi is amazing.It is an irony in the film that it took a foreign girl to make the youth realize of their patriotic heritage. Music of the movie is awesome and suits the mood with romantic numbers like' Tu bin bat-aye',to the hip op 'pathshala' and finally to the highly emotive""Lukka Ch.."".The picturisation of songs is great. The director has used the characters very intelligently working on their strengths and also the depiction of political characters is commendable .The best aspect of the movie is the editing and screenplay, although I feel a better job could have been done with the dialogs. All in all it is a great must see movie.."
"When I first watched Rang De Basanti, it started out as a fair film, telling the story of a group of friends making a film about freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and his friends. As it progressed on i realized, well Aamir has done better than Mangal Panday. Then after the intermission, i said, ""hmmmm...good film"" and i don't say that easily. But when the film ended i thought ""Finally symbolism has returned to Indian cinema, and Aamir has regained his status as a superstar."" Aamir Khan easily outclasses himself and all the other performances in 2006 and breathtakingly acts very naturally. This performance is unlike any of his previous ones and certainly the best performance by an actor of his age. I'd even say that he outclasses Mr. Bachan in Black and Paa. For this two reasons are present. No.1 both of the roles by Amitabh in Black and Paa were overplayed and both films were copies from two very good Hollywood flicks. The rest of the cast is also very well put together and each and everyone pulls off a decent performance. The soundtrack of the film is perfect for its mood and this is coming from someone who does not, under any circumstances acknowledge A.R Rahman as the Mozart of India. I'd recommend this film to anyone who has taste for good cinema and who loves films with a message, because at the end the message in the film is what makes it memorable. Hats off to Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, Aamir Khan and A.R. Rahman and a memorable thank you to the supporting cast that made this film the best of 2006 (in my opinion)."
"This movie condones the use of violence as a means to bring about change in society. This in general is an interesting viewpoint that deserves cinematic analysis, since according to many, it is justifiable when society is subjected to tyrannical rule, usually by an external aggressor. But the society depicted in this film is modern India - yes corrupt India, but also India of the free press, universal adult franchise, world's largest democracy etc. Most important, it is an India that is ruled by *democratically elected people*! Assassinating an elected leader is as good as executing a portion of the electorate. So does the film suggest that we should condone mass murder? The parallels between the British Raj and modern day corruption, and those between hot-headed brainless youngsters and the thoughtful revolutionaries of the freedom movement were shameful - the British were not elected by us - they were an imperialistic power from a different country. Violence may well have been the only resort (though therein lies a healthy debate - there were many thousands who believed that there were other ways to bring about change).If we do not like the politicians we elect, the rational course of action should be ""don't vote for them"", not ""let's kill them"". It is amazing that such a movie can be made in the same country that produced Mahatma Gandhi. It is also sad that it took a British filmmaker to make that film and an Indian film maker to make this one.Having said that, the movie was interesting because it raised questions that have not been raised in mainstream Hindi movies. Unfortunately it answered them as well, and incorrectly, and simplistically, IMO. The positive reaction that RDB has received so far is far from funny - it is downright worrisome. Modern Indian youth seems to think in unison that boys in the story are to be glorified and congratulated for what they did. Even the supposedly sophisticated Manhattan audience with whom I shared the screening started clapping at the end of the movie. I was quite nauseated, and dismayed.I came out of the movie quite angry, and raved and ranted at my wife for a while re. the moral center of the movie. By the time I reached home I had calmed down, and realized that if a movie was able to create a evoke such strong emotion (even if a negative one) then something must be said of the film and the filmmaker.Morality apart, the movie has huge holes in the plot, which has been written about in these pages."
"This film's absurdly high rating insinuates all that is wrong with today's urban Indian youth. Before I get into all the bashing, I have to give credit where it is due. I have to agree that the movie is technically strong; the cinematography is charming, Rahman's music is one of his best, editing is crisp, and the acting is mostly above par and a few outstanding. Where the movie fails, is in its core theme and the message it tries to convey. A group of college students who are indifferent to the problems of the country, as most of us are, suddenly one day gear up to kill the Defence Minister of the country because they 'think' he is responsible for their friend's(an airforce pilot) death. They are utterly convinced that their friend died because of the mediocre parts that went into the manufacturing of the crashed MiG plane, despite having no evidence to establish this whatsoever. They never for once bother to think that the minister could be innocent. What is sickening is the way their act is hailed at the end as if it was the most heroic thing ever done on the face of the earth. The movie constantly compares these half-boiled-attitude youth with the revolutionaries of the Indian freedom struggle which I think is an insult to those real heroes. The plot holes are many. The attack on the people peacefully protesting by the police in the presence of media is simply ridiculous to be real. Now, icing on the cake was the climax,when these 'nationalists' break into a radio station to confess and justify their action. I am not sure of what did these guys think would happen after they confess and allege the minister of corruption on AIR? The country would rise against the government?? when clearly it didn't happen when the innocent people were beaten black and blue in the presence of media! We Indian youth are susceptible to the mob-mentality. The director has exploited it thoroughly. Now, this movie has gained the cult status among the urban dudes because, as a quote in the movie goes, it is easy to grumble about all the ills in the country (and kill its minister) than changing the society for the good, say by becoming an IAS/IPS officer- which requires quite a struggle than stupidly throwing up your life that serves nothing.PS: I would have given this movie a 6/10. But, 1 is just a feeble attempt to bring it to its deserving position."
"In continuation of Indian Cinema's new found interest in dishing out sensible stuff, Rang De Basanti is a runaway winner in terms of acting, direction, screenplay..you name it, and of course MESSAGE. The movie very aptly captures the lives of our youth, but more importantly goes further than portraying a carefree hedonistic lifestyle by providing them important issues to deliberate on. Like how to pro actively deal with corruption, and how to respect the sacrifices made by our predecessors to achieve our almost taken-for-granted independence. Also, the issue of equanimity between Hindus and Muslims is dealt with very well. The camera-work is fantastic. Great scenes captured from Delhi and other places. A lot of sharp humor interspersed with the typical Punjabi-style wit acted by Aamir Khan. Sidharth Narayan and Kunal Kapoor have done their roles proud. Soha Ali Khan is as cute as can be and does a very mature role. Sharman Joshi, however, is the pick of the lot as his role involves a lot of grey areas and changing character. In all, a MUST SEE for Indians everywhere! I'd give this movie a perfect 10!"
"Now all of us should commend RdB for the bold initiative in putting forth the idea of what the common citizen of India would like to do to every..cough...democratically elected...cough...politician. The movie was quite influential to the point that the political scum really need to worry about their safety. Having said all that, there is really nothing in this movie itself besides that which is worth mentioning. Its the standard Bollywood fare of singing, dancing, religion related fighting and a look at the past freedom struggle from the British. All that changes when one of the friends gets killed in an air crash, attributed to low quality spares approved by corrupt politicians. The heroes thus go and kill a politician in broad daylight. The obvious happens and they are hunted down and killed by counter terrorist squads. The end."
"Rang de basanti is a well made film and thoroughly enjoyable. The acting and screenplay is brilliant and this fits in another one of the all time greats of Hindi Cinema. Brilliant Soundtrack by A R Rehman and Aamir Khan's acting adds all up.THe only problems I had with the movie were - 1. A white girl speaking broken but kinda fluent Hindi --- Come On!! that was really cheesy. 2. Some of the patriotism stuff was really too cheesy. 3. There is something called restraint while dealing with terrorists??? Hellloooo.. Most terrorists in nearly all civilized countries are given a chance to surrender and go under trial. The commandos simply do not shoot on site unless its a hostage situation. 4. Do you think the Government is stupid?? not to know who killed the Defense minister?? Again some bollywood stupidity I see.Some of my friends said this movie was too revolutionary. I was disappointed in the end after seeing it, it was good definitely but not the best."
"Plot Outline: Sue (Alice Patten) is inspired by the legendary characters of Bhagat Singh, Azad et al from her grandfather's diaries during his days in the British Raj. She lands in Delhi to make a film on them and finds those characters in Sonia's (Soha) friends DJ (Aamir), Karan (Siddharth), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) & Sukhi (Sharman Joshi). The friends belong to Gen Next who care not about values like Patriotism & Sacrifice. The accidental death of their friend Flt Lt Ajay Rathod (Madhavan) in a MIG Crash and the wrongful blame on the pilot makes them take up cudgels against the corrupt establishment.Comment: Very rarely are movies that talk of relevant values for the Youth. Most of the Patriotic movies are full of either anti-angrez or anti-Pak sentiments with heaps of Melodrama thrown in. With RDB, Rakeysh Mehra has made a significant movie from stereotypes. Unlike others, RDB does not have the typical 'hero' & 'heroine'. Aamir and his friends are people the youth can easily identify with. They are simple minded students who live care free lives and they plainly react 'normally'. Those who have disliked this movie are the ones who prefer stereotyped abnormalities.Most notable performance in RDB is that of Siddharth whose character grows as the movie progresses. Aamir, of course has been brilliant but looks too old to play a College Student. Some of the movie's best moments are Madhavan's proposal to Soha, breaking down of Aamir in Sue's apartment, Atul Kulkarni's recital of Bismil's poetry and of course the last scenes of Siddharth and Aamir. Don't miss AR Rahman's youthful and soulful music too! Quotes thrown in RDB include: ""There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them"". Inspiring, isn't it? Watch the movie to get charged. This one is highly recommended for those who're young and those who still think themselves to be young!"
"A year and a half ago I commented on ""Lakshya"": Don't expect a rabid anti war or anti establishment film. The time has not yet come for this in Bollywood. With ""Rang de Basanti"" Bollywood has made a film that clearly does not shy away from pointing a finger at the holy cows 'army' and 'government' and dares to suggest that corruption and infamy extend up to the highest ranks and most respected institutions of Indian society. While the opening offers the usual disclaimer (fictional story bla bla) the end draws clear parallels to reality. And what the characters in the film think and say reflects what young Indians actually do think and say. This is not Bollywood fantasy land, running around trees and you know the drill. It's nonetheless a genuine Bollywood film. Just a far better one than the usual kind. Good performance from an ensemble cast all around, no superstar shenanigans, catchy music, an inventive visual style, technically sound execution and a quite realistic script make this one a winner not to be missed. Go see it on the big screen."
"A brilliant plot has been utterly wasted in the second half that culminates in a series of f***ed up events. As one comes away from the movie, one is led to ask 'what did the kids die for'? What was the take home message (kill the minister and give a half baked justification)? Clearly the purpose of Sue's visit is lost and so is the message that could have been given. The pre-independence Bhagat singh & Co had a clearly defined enemy (Brits) and a solution to that (freedom). What parallels could be justifiably drawn in the modern day 'Bhagat singh & Co'? To me the movie can be conveniently divided into two parts? The 'Pre-Madhavan' half and the 'Post-Madhavan' half. While the build-up of the storyline in the first half was nothing short of fantastic (until the death of Madhavan's character), the plot fails miserably after the news break of his death. The storyline breaks down completely after the TV episode and what happens thereafter is a bunch of disgruntled youth showing their ire on a bumbling 'defence minister'(who becomes a hero anyway). The movie also takes convenient potshots the saffron-brigade as if the vast majority in that gang were a bunch of trouble seeking goons.The story had an excellent chance showing a new breed of revolutionaries who could have made the faulty system PAY for its actions and bring the government down to its heels. Instead of literally assassinating the minister (who conveniently reflects the faulty system), they could have systematically gone about assassinating the character of the bad minister and senior officials whose shady deals often cost the lives of invaluable fighter pilots. The movie 'Tango Charlie' and 'Lakshya' perform admirably in this regard where the climax is smooth and makes an even landing. In the end the movie looks nothing more than piece of good documentary. The first half is really natural and thought provoking. The second half degenerates into a hurried climax, thus insulting the great performances by the entire cast (not one excluded).Rating - Frankly anything above 7 is over-rating."
"This movie is one of the ""original"" and unique movies that India has ever produced. It has a very fresh concept and a very different look to patriotism. Although it may seem that this movie is a Pav-Bhaji of Dil Chahta Hai, The Legend of Bhagat Singh, and Nayak, yet it stands out with a class of its own.The movie has many surprises, and Madhavan could have been the biggest surprise if the production team could have managed to keep it a secret. But that didn't happen. Another big surprise in the movie is the latter half. The movie undergoes a complete transformation after the interval. I felt that the pre-interval section could have been edited to make it short and sweet. Now, its like so sweet that the viewer would get diabetes :) The star cast is good. It would have been better if they would have picked up more ""known"" faces. Although acting-wise, there were no shortcomings, but still, it would have been better. The most primary reason why this was not done, I think, is because all the 5 characters have a dominant role in the film. So, even if there was one good/famous star, Aamir Khan may not be able to gather the attention that he has managed to do now. Soha Ali Khan looks pretty and she knows acting as well! She has done her role very well.The climax is something that I personally didn't like much. I was not very much happy with the current climax, but I'm afraid that I wouldn't have been happy either even if the climax would have been the other way round. So... to know the climax, go watch the film. Its certainly a good one to watch in the theatre! Rating: 8 out of 10"
"(Note - may contain spoilers! )RDB is a different movie, contemporary in it's screenplay, music and theme. Patriotic movies more often ignite the spirits within you, some question the System, some question the people. But none has suggested a solution, a realistic solution, not a hypothetical projection of a historic depiction.This movie attempts to recreate the aura, psyche of Bhagath Singh and Azad's troupe in modern day era. It simply is a rendering of the past in the present context. It doesn't try to tell you whether Bhagat Singh is right or wrong or whether what the 4 college guys did is right or wrong. It just says - ""This is what happens, when some people stand up and believe in what they fight. This is whats gonna happen to any youth in this country if the Government continues to BS around and no you don't need no Al Qaida to do, just normal people can"".Whats the result?Instead of a History Channel on Bhagath Singh, you get a contemporary rendering of the characters in present day India with a seemingly interleaving screenplay of past/present. Most biopics on Bhagat Singh tried to portray as him as an extra ordinary person and simply repaint history without telling the psyche and the circumstances. I think thats why this movie deserves a great applause by rendering a difficult subject wrt the present people, people like you and me who never thought of execution of the thought.The cast is first rate. After a long time, you will feel that a popular Hindi cinema has no stars, just characters.(I can only remember Lagaan, Swades, DCH close to this in terms of characterisation in the recent past). AR Rahman, brilliant.Its sad to see so many good movies with his good music do not get the attention that he truly deserves.Well, here comes the down part. The first half makes you completely fall in love with this movie and just when you start building expectations ... the movie fails. Starting with the protest of Ajay's flight accident, assassination of Defense Minister (quite cool eh? Didn't know that you could just shoot a minister point blank and still nobody can figure out who the killer is. Quite stupid), to the insanely gruesome mass shooting towards the end, this is where you start to feel that the director is using too much of liberty and insisting you not to use your brains.Watch out for some of the best moments - 1) When Amir cries for Madhavan at the dinner table, telling how useless, helpless he is. Brilliant acting. I always consider a tragic scene as extremely difficult coz you just don't cry seeing the actor cry, but if it gives u a millisecond of gasp- he deserves an applause. 2) when the 4 buddies remove their shirts and wave across a fighter plane just grazing on their above. Wonderful poetry! Also shows that you don't have to have great bods to remove the shirt. It could still look great. 3) last scene with Siddharth / Amir when they're smiling to glory ...Acting is great ... no one has screwed up in any dept. However the last 1 hour is a bit amateurish and could have been avoided with more sophistication. Like all those movies which try to say something about patriotism, this one brags about it too, yet in a different subtler ""warning"" tone. But my point is""what do we do now. Do you have a solution?""When will we see a movie which could bring us hope, which addresses the Issues and brings out the execution in reality? Opinions like these will come and go but the Problem still remainsthe bottom line 8/10 - Brave attempt on cinematography, music, screenplay, casting and storytelling of 6th class history. Ironically, the premise of the movie should have been told in writing by the director towards the end, saying its just a ironic depiction of the past and not the moral of the story. Unfortunately for some viewers the message could be deceptive as its very very subtle.Swades on the other hand could be realistic, it hits you hard, very deeply with a message"
"i juz finished watching RDB ... and I'm Speechless! I'm a Pakistani, but i had tears in my during ending episodes. whether, it is Pakistan or India, both govt. are corrupted and we are corrupted. Nowadays, we are living but without a soul. This movie followed by Swades, made me and i hope my friends ... ppl from my generation will wake us from living such dead and shallow life. RDB is definitely one of the best shown the ugly side of politics however politics is ugly ... One should realise how our ancestors sacrificed themselves for their and Our's Independence Which we take for granted. We should be ashamed of ourselves. We keep saying abt revolution and change and same time, say our country has no future. How it is possible, when we feel nothing for our country? Well, this should be my review on the movie but i wrote what i really felt at the end of the show. Must say ... buy your next show ticket and Be Patriotic ..Just for once please! thanksfrom, a person living far from his own homeland and just thinking about his own life."
"RDB is an out and out pop corn entertainer. I liked the movie because it made me smile as often as Dil Chahta Hai. Saying anything beyond that, e.g. movie for the youth, movie for our future, best movie of our generation (avg. mortality has increased well beyond 30 yrs. even in poorest of African countries), etc., is plain kidding ourselves.the big problem is that the movie heightens expectations in the first half and like most of the promising movies in the recent past, lets down in 2nd half. 2nd half is just too hurried, half baked, and flawed. well, bollywood wallas don't like to give us too much of a good thing and always seem to come short.It will be great to watch a Hindi movie in which complex issues facing our society are addressed in an intelligent/clever manner rather than taking a short cut and shooting the politicians. ""Go, kill a guy you think is a root of all evils"" is a non-message. it is high time the scripts matured and showed something of substance that meant something to us. till then I will continue to ""dingi-danga-dingi-danga-dingi-danga-ding"" :)"
"This movie is like watching a 20 round boxing match expecting to see an epic knockout, only to see two dancing queens prancing around the ring when finally in the 15th round you get a knockdown. You get all excited, finally something, this must be where it gets good. Only to watch em Pasa Doble into to the 20th round. No'one else mentions this, as if they didn't notice, but this movie is over three hours long. I promise you, you WILL spend well over the first half of that wondering why all the rave. The best part about this movie is the hilariously ridiculous ""western"" music they dance to. After watching this movie I felt incredibly far removed from Indian culture. One of the main characters wears jean jackets, and fingerless gloves! Think Fonzie, but less cool, and not a caricature. Indians, direct people away from this movie, cause I seriously felt embarrassed for you as I watched it."
"The first half of the movie was promising out to be a 5 on 10, but then they started the second half which brings it down to the bottom floor :( There's attempt at good movie-making , but obviously they have succeeded in making good money. I admire the business acumen of the movie makers to put in a little this and a little that to pull in most importantly the rich crowds - the Punjabis in India and abroad. Secondly, it uses some cutting-edge techniques to make the movie LOOK good to critics in India who are mainly exposed to trash after mindless song-dance trash for review. This is the only reason I can think for this movie to get rave reviews. And then , there are ALSO those BIG HIT dance numbers which the yuppy crowd goes into see picturized on the big screen. But does a soundtrack make a movie good ?!! Once the audience are in , the movie preaches and preaches and preaches. Then it preaches AGAIN !I don't mind the above mentioned tricks 'coz the movie makers want to make money firstly , and hats off to them for succeeding . However , strickly speaking about the movie's quality , it has problems.Today's India is building itself on its IT and economic policies and capitalism , but this movie preaches about how the youth today should adopt violence against the establishment to make the country move ahead. This movie ( and others coming out of India ) glorifies Bhagat Singh etc. a bit too much. There have been some classics about him in the distant past , but the movie industry seems to inclined to portray these guys as the ones who actually brought freedom to India. Well ... like Mahatma Gandhiji did not exist , Or the World War did not create problems for British enough for them to start pulling out of most countries . A biographic movie about Bhagat Singh etc. would've been tolerable, but this movie PREACHES that the techniques of Singh and Azad are SO EFFECTIVE that they can be successful in today's world. I have doubts about that.Well , Youth of India ,thankfully you don't have the guts to practice the lessons from this movie. However if you DO , please don't! India is progressing fine, thank you. In fact, India can do with a little lesser crime.Other irritants abound in this movie. One I can think of right now was the evil corrupt and mean politician with an IQ of bird-droppings. Now ... politicians anywhere might be mean , evil and corrupt , but they're generally among the smartest people on earth. But this one was so dumb that he actually criticizes a dead pilot! Not surprisingly , people were not pleased with him.The list of unbelievable irritants can go on , so I'll end with one last thing about this movie which which is WRONG - it leads u to think Punjab is the only place in India !But hey ,the movie has the regular masalas for a block-buster - Romance , loud music and violence. Add to that a lot of patriotic hoohaa. Then there's Hindu-Muslim solidarity. So , keep your intellect aside and you might enjoy the movie."
As mention in tagline it was 20 years way ahead from its time. Really ausum movie. As I like every time that all character has given the importance and they have really acted very well.Jai hind
"In a trsh like Bollywood where most movies are like shts, this movie is a pure gem.. I think it's a must watch Bollywood movie... Watching this excellent movie is worth your time..."
"A disturbingly bad film, and a rare example of one that utterly misses its own point: initially it's a call for unity among different religions, and a story of patriotic resistance to the evil repression of authority. At the end the message is: forget legitimate protest, just kill those in power whom you don't like. Starting off as a pleasant enough Bollywood entertainment about disaffected youth and the western blond girl who engages them in life and reminds them of the heroism of their ancestors against the evil British Colonial rulers (let's not even go there) the second half completely changes track and ends up as a political manifesto advocating violent terrorism as a way for social change.It's dispiriting that the film's (initial) message of unity, democratic change and resistance to the evils of power could have been done much MORE powerfully without violating the internal logic of the story. The last quarter of the film comes out of the blueit's like you're watching a different movie. There are about 10 different ways the script could have gone differently and held together conceptually, while keeping the message which is (or initially seemed to be) about coming together and resisting oppression: SPOILER ALERT!the youths could have been awakened to their problems, made a stand, and taken over the radio station, (even been killed and martyred for their beliefs) without killing someone in vigilante fashionthe youths could have discussed their understandable vengeful feelings before acting on them.the women, originally portrayed as agents of change, could have been included in the decisions, or continued as characters to encourage critical discussion and thinking (instead of being pushed aside and become the clichéd tragic, mourning, passive, victims). the potentially interesting parallels between the present-day corrupt Indian government with the colonial British one could have been explored, and taken to the logical conclusion, which is that terrorism and violence only continue the cycle, cause more divisiveness and don't work. (Gandhi, Partition, hello!)"
"This that rare kind of movies which tells you a story blending contemporary present and known past in a way that dividing line is blurred and a message for future emanates as clearly as it could be. Strong characters, amazing editing and sequence, excellent cinematography, contextual and great music. All in All ""Aamir Khan"" is to bollywood what ""Tom Hanks"" to Hollywood. First half is just university and college fun as visible in day to day campus life in cities. In fact initial sequence on auditions is as real as it could be and does comment on sorry state of affairs when it comes to self-confidence and meaningfulness of youthful ness. Movie is quite clean on details and scenes of events like kakori, parliament bombing touch a chord though they have been played time and again.A must watch!!"
"""Saare politicians KO line mein khade kar ke goli se udaa dena chahiye"".That line said by the first caller makes the climax of Rang De Basanti work. It throws back at us the hollowness of our words. You only have to hear the audience laugh. We are laughing at ourselves. It is so outrageous and yet so.. so.. believable. I feel a sense of pride in the fact that I belong to a society where a film like Rang De Basanti is made and then shown openly. The film gets away with murder. It is surprising that it didn't create more controversy than it actually did. Perhaps, because the film is making a point here, an argument which is not easy to refute.Films have been made before on similar anti-establishment themes. One has always enjoyed watching Hu Tu Tu every time it's shown on TV. Hazaaron Khwahishein Aisi was, I thought, one of the best movies of last year. But after Rang De Basanti, these films now smack of intellectual elitism. You really don't need to be a student of political science or a kurta-wearing socialist to think and talk about revolutions and changing societies. The characters here are you and me and your friends in the neighbourhood. One of them, in fact, is a self-confessed loser.The film asks a lot of questions at various levels, some very subtle. For instance, Bhagat Singh and Rajguru can court arrest in British occupied India and expect a fair trial so as to be able to put forth their point. But our characters from 21st century India can't even dream of doing the same. They have to instead..Perhaps too much is being read into it. It is only a film after all. A commercial venture out there to make a profit. But then what is it that makes people think and debate issues? Books? Lectures? Newspaper articles? Then why not films? Why not films with songs? Why not films with songs and a superstar? One had always believed that words are more effective than visuals. Rang De Basanti shows you the power of imagery. The effect created would have been impossible with the written or the spoken word.Dean Jones was recently saying to Sivaramakrishnan that we tend to use words like 'great' and 'genius' too liberally. So I will restrain myself. But, Rang De Basanti is my all time favourite movie. Even in terms of pure cinematic experience. Just when you thought you had seen it all.That was my two pence worth.From the receiving end of 'Look who's talking' ARIF ATTAR"
"Amazing movie. A story about a bunch of rich youth killing a petty minister distantly involved in a rather petty injustice and then getting killed for it - labeled as ""awakening of a generation""....wow! Youth of India, awaken, drop your beer bottles and pick up your guns! It seems that according to the makers of this movie there is not enough violence already going on in India, there is dire need for more, hence let's make a movie glorifying it.And it's not only the violence. I can very well agree that violence can serve a purpose in extreme situations (fighting for freedom, for example). But counter-posing India's fight for freedom with the pathetic scenario of fighting a system that uses cheap military equipment and thus endangers the lives of a handful of military officers flying their MIGs.....simply pathetic comparison. One one had you have the fate of a nation....and on the other, all they could come up with, from all the myriad of problems of contemporary India, is the issue of 1-2 persons dying because of flying old military planes? Is this something that affects the society at large? Is this REALLY something worth killing for.....or, for that matter, making a movie about? Is this the awakening of the spirit of old freedom fighters in today's partying youth? I mean..common....there sure must be more worthwhile and extensive problems for which to fight against the system..and kill a minister too!I found the movie to be absolutely pathetic. The visuals were good, the acting was also OK...but the story is simply outrageously petty, and that too depicted in such a grandiose manner that it can only invite scorn. Moreover, I found it to have very little to do with real India, though it claims to be a patriotic movie. None of the real problems or reactions of the people of this country have been as little as brushed by this movie. What is this ""awakening of a generation"" thing? As far as I am concerned, and I'm sure most people would agree, drinking and partying is far less dangerous than engaging in mindless revenge-killing. Is this what the youth of India is supposed to do to tackle the problems of this society? Revenge killing? (it's not even like the murder had any other purpose except pure revenge). There's no awakening of any youth in this movie: It's just a bunch of restless rich college-goers rather naturally drifting from mindless boozing to mindless killing, that's all. And that too while imagining that they are doing some great service to their country. Apparently most of the movie-goers also fell for it. But just step outside the cinema-hall and look around at the REAL problems of this country, and you'll realize that old military planes are most probably very low on the list of priorities, if at all there."
"Sue finds her grandfather's journal of his days as a prison guard in colonial India. She wants to make a film about it, but the film company doesn't want to. She goes to India to meet up with a friend who introduces her to a bunch of University friends. They're all fun loving and aimless. She makes the movie using them. At first, they don't understand the commitment and the drive of the characters. Eventually the film influences them all. However the death of someone special ignites a dangerous fire in them all.I'm not much into Bollywood, but I figure I check out this highly rated movie. I do like the first half very much. I could do without the song and dance. However I love all the characters and their struggle to find purpose in their superficial lives. I could even gloss over the song and dance breaks.Then there is a big turn midway. While I understand the reason for the turn, it's highly overdone and too big. It takes the guys down a wrong path. If there is a good message in this movie, it is compromised by the second half."
"this movie released 4 days back and from the second day till this evening i have watched the movie 3 times.'RANG DE BASANTI' doesn't leave any scope for excuses to not to watch the movie.to tell the story in a few sentences it is a story about a group of urban friends from Delhi who are urged by an independent documentary filmmaker to act in a movie about the Indian revolutionaries fighting against the British empire in the 1920s. initially as they act they do not believe in the ideal-isms of freedom ,patriotism and revolution as incorporated in the film but as the story moves on they begin to come face to face with the sacrifices made in the past in the revolution.as the story moves on the line between past and present becomes more and more blurred until it vanishes.here the friends become themselves the very characters they were playing in the documentary movie.the rest u have to see for yourselves.the movie is actually 2 movies in one.we see about the revolutionaries BHAGAT SINGH ,RAJGURU,chandrasekhar AZAD,BISMIL etc in flashbacks.we get to see the KAKORI train robbery,the SAUNDERS murder,the SIMON demonstrations,the hunger strike by BHAGAT SINGH and others while in jail,the JALIANWALAH BAGH massacre and many other things. then we keep coming back to the present story of the group of friends.the music by AR Rehman is""FANTABULOUS"". it is one with the film.it lifts the film to a different level altogether.unlike other typical Hindi movies in here you never realize when the songs come and go.they are simply a part of the story.in fact sometimes you would even wish that they were a bit long.i don't know why it is ,may because of the songs themselves or simply the way they have been shot.the photography is excellent.BINOD PRADHAN like his earlier movies has shown what a good cinematographer he is.the acting was fantastic.not only did the seasoned actors like AAMIR KHAN,ATUL KULKARNI and R.MADHAVAN but the younger ones like SHARMAN,SOHA,KUNAL and SIDDHARTH have done a perfect job.even you have to take the hats off for the support actors ANUPAM KHAR,KIRON KHER,WAHEEDA REHMAN.a special mention has to be there for ALICE PATTEN .she has done a great job.RAKEYSH OMPRAKASH MEHRA this is a movie of a lifetime.thank you for making it."
If you think that this is Yet another Indian movie dealing with the famous Indian freedom fighters.You are wrong.Raang de Basanti was a completely different flavor of all the patriotic films.The script clearly captures and awesomely merges the past freedom and the current India. It takes you along the lighter side of Indian youth...and colorful Indian locations..suddenly drifting to full action. Part where Madhavan presents Soha the ring and the song that follows here awesomely crafted. The cast selected (Esp Alice and the character Sukhi) were too good.Alternating of past and present and making them to meet at a point was awesome.Hats off to screenplay.First half was fully concentrated on the Film making by Alice which had built a different mindset ti the audience was died or ended abruptly in the second half.
"Every Aamir Khan movie is special. I was lucky enough to catch the premier show on 25th, the atmosphere was perfect and the buzz of anticipation could be felt in the theatre. As there are no reviews for the movie at that time, we had no idea how the movie would be. I always thought Aamir Khan was a heavy risk taker. He proves me right again with RDB. He needs to be applauded for not over shadowing his co-stars. Also his enthusiasm to make movies that pack a message to the society needs special mention.After all the hassles of RDB had from the defense ministry of India, IAF and Maneka Gandhi. RDB finally makes it without losing out on any impactful parts.The movie starts with Sue (Alice Patton) reading her fathers diary. Her father being an office during the Independence struggle of India writes a dairy glorifying the Indian freedom fighters. Sue rekindled by the diary travels to Delhi to make a documentary. This is where the story starts to form a crux. The whole group comes together. The first 80mins of the movie are really hilarious with DJ (Aamir) one-liners as well as his passes at Sue. Sunil as Sarman Joshi needs special mention as he makes us laugh a lot.The first half cruises as the documentary develops, so do the group of start thinking more about what they are and what their destinies are. The main part of the movie starts when Madhavan who plays a MIG pilot dies due to technical complications because cheap Russian parts were used in the flights by the defense ministry.The story that follows after the death of Madhavan is a high-pitched drama. It absorbs us in RDB, the direction of Omprakash Mehra come to the fore. The whole movie runs on comparison to the freedom struggle where few bits of similar situation are shown in Sepia toning.The movie ends quite dramatically and will be quite a surprise to everyone. Few points that even the perfectionist Aamir missed are.? The murder of the defense ministry had to be a bit more complicated than shooting some one on the road side ? The Pilots at Madhavans funeral looked like school kids. This really took the intensity of that scene away.But saying the above are negative points would be wrong as it would be too critical in an otherwise good movie.A R Rahman's background score keeps the movie at a fast pace; the songs are all well woven onto the movie.Some outstanding phases of the movie? Auditioning after Sue arrives in Delhi ? Auditioning the DJ gang ? DJ speaking in Hindi thinking Sue doesn't understand it ? Scenes between Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor ? Aamirs funny lines with Sarman Joshi ? Siddartha is ultra cool in the movieSiddartha quoted in one of his interviews that without Aamir Khan there would be no Rang De Basanti. I would like to applaud Aamir, UTV and Omprakash for making such a wonderful movie. It might not be a complete entertainer but it definitely is undoubtedly one of the better movies. Go for it"
"A brilliant movie with fantastic performances and great music. It sure made my day !!!!!!!!........and the days to come !!!Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's movie 'Rang De Basanti' is a must-watch for reasons that the length of this review may not suffice to express. More than just a technically brilliant flick, 'Rang De Basanti' has a story that entertains you, makes you think and stirs you deep inside in the end.The most remarkable part of the movie is the parallel that Mehra draws between the freedom fighters and DJ and his group of friends. The movie keeps transposing the same actors into characters from the past. And then, as the story draws to its conclusion, even these differences in the characters disappear. The modern, city-bread 'young guns' of the twenty first century become one in spirit with the revolutionaries who sacrificed themselves for the country's freedom."
"There is no doubt about it. Aamir Khan is totally forgiven for the Mangal Pandey disaster. Ketan Mehta did everything possible to mess up Aamir's record, but with Rang De Basanti, Khan's ""Rising"" mistakes will be forgotten.The director (only a film old with Aks), is also one of the screenwriters, and has written a compelling, emotional, informational and entertaining storyline.The story starts of with a British TV producer, Sue, who comes to India to make a film on freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and his compatriots. Her story is based on the diary entries of her grandfather, who was a soldier in the empire during the 1920s. With the help of an Indian friend in Delhi called Sonia (Soha Ali Khan Pataudi), she starts auditions for the cast of her film, at Sonia's college. Here she also meets Sonia's friends: DJ (Aamir Khan), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor), Sukhi (Sherman Joshi) and Karan (Siddharth Narayan), as well as Sonia's boyfriend Ajay (Madhavan in a guest appearance). This group is soon joined by Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) who is a pro Shiv Sena activist. What follows on from here is an unbelievable ride of fun and emotions. A story that starts out in the middle of a college day with friends playing jokes and having fun (a la Dil Chahta Hai) breaks into an adventure of self discovery.Even at the interval, you will not be able to imagine what the end is like. I wouldn't like to say more about the storyline, you just have t watch it yourself.Why is is movie a winner? I heard the album before watching the movie and found it to be very average fare from A.R. Rahman. My opinion changed completely after watching the movie. The music is so apt, and plays such an integral role in the film that you can't imagine anyone else having done it. In fact, the scenes there are scenes that are actually memorable BECAUSE of the effect of the music. People tell me that Rahman is losing his touch, since a lot of new music directors have popped up. I disagree. AR Rahman is a person who makes music completely from his soul. His soul needs to understand the feel of the movie. The director needs to tell him what the storyline is, what the scenes are. And I'm sure this director did. He had a crisp story, and a very serious vision of what the feel of every scene is. Once he passes that info on to Rahman, the music director transforms that into a musical piece. Basically, give AR Rahman a clear-cut theme of the movie, and he will create magic. Examples aplenty in Roja, Rangeela, Bombay, Dil Se, 1947 Earth, Lagaan, Saathiya and Yuva.The casting is a real treat. Its rare to come across an Indian movie where there are no casting mistakes, but this is a unique gem. Not a single character was miscast and every single person gave their best to the role. You can't imagine other actors in these roles. Kunal Kapoor as Aslam is superb, Aamir Khan is brilliant, Soha Al Khan surprised me with her poise and confidence, Sherman Joshi is great, Atul Kulkarni has proved time and again that he is a serious character artist and Siddharth as Karan is another role that comes alive very well. In addition to that, the savior is that they have cast a British woman who actually has some command over the Hindi language, so instead of struggling with her accent, you see her emoting her role really well. The supporting cast, made up of Kiron Kher (as DJ's mom), Anupam Kher (Karan's dad), Madhavan and Waheeda Rahman are finely suited for their roles.The director has made a brilliant venture into the movie world. I would like to see what else comes out in 2006 because I am having a hard time believing that there will be anything much this year that will beat this film. I rarely rate things this high, and I would have given it a ten if it wasn't for the scene where a certain woman hears bad news about her man on TV, while she is purchasing green chudis. Bit lame."
"**** SPOILERS ***** Had read my share of decidedly mixed reviews, but nothing had prepared me for this.I was shocked, staring back at the screen in disbelief last night at my local multiplex.My quibbles: 1. THE SCRIPT - Too much going on, too many layers. Voice-over, one strand of the narrative set in the past, another set in the present. Somehow, all the different elements don't gel together all that well. Something that was obvious when Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekar Azad et al end up moving along to Khalbali blaring on the soundtrack.Events happen rather randomly in a disjointed kind of way and my jaw hit the floor when the following happened  for me, big WTF moments: - Aamir suddenly deciding that ""drastic measures have to be taken"" and that to kill the politico would be the best thing to do, that, even though they had established that sensibilities had changed and that people -- young people esp. -- are no longer as politically engaged in as they were say 80-odd years ago.Even though it had been foreshadowed by having Karan's father coincidentally (and very conveniently) be involved with the Russian armament companies, Madhavan's death came off as a cheap plot device.The killing actually takes place. WTF? - They hijack the radio station. The DJ makes the dramatic announcement about the killing and concludes with "" and now ROOBAROO!""  and the actual upbeat song plays on the soundtrack, clashing with all the dramatics that came before I was dying.Karan killing his father  because ""it's the only way out""  again, WTF? - Ajay's mother slipping into a coma (!!!) and symbolically giving signs of life once the ""deed"" is done  again, creaky plot mechanics IMO.Now, mind you, I'm not decrying the fact that they were yearning for change. I empathize, nay, I sympathize with and fully subscribe to revolutionary movements across the globe and their ideals, but here, I just felt that in the context of the film, the actions that follow Ajay's (Madhavan) death, were unwarranted and unnecessary, and that, surely, there could have been other ways, peaceful ways, to bring about change. As it is, it came off as the kind of empty-headed liberal ideology that gives conservative elements in governments around the world ammunition to dismiss such movements as ""hotheaded"".Maybe my above comments show how little I know about Indian politics and as one character says in the film, ""the corruption"" rooted in it.Still, I had no sympathy for any of the characters, who quite frankly, came off as idiots IMHO. All they did was dance around and do nothing significant, with Aamir's character the most reprehensible of the lot, for he was the eldest and should have known better. Not holding down a job, living off his mother, and hanging out with his friends on campus. Was his character a ""model"" to follow? I have my doubts about that. ""BE A REBEL"" the soundtrack intones hhmmmm.The second half feels rushed, as if the screenwriter was going through the motions and trying to hit as many plot points as possible in the most mechanical fashion.2. ALICE'S CHARACTER Someone please explain what kind of documentary that was she was making? A reenactment of these revolutionaries' lives shot on the cheap with a DV camera? Sure looked sleek on screen what with the sepia cast, thousands of extras, etc LOL. Guess that budget of hers inflated as it went along And what kind of documentary was that anyway? Another problem is that when the film starts, SHE is the central figure in the plot. Midway through, her and the whole documentary storyline are discarded. Talk about consistency. Also, that AAMIR love interest subplot goes nowhere.My biggest problem though is WHY IS SHE  ANOTHER GORA  THE AGENT OF CHANGE? Why is it, that SHE, a white woman, is the one who rouses the Indians to consciousness about their life and their lack of engagement? That's what made me most angry actually. She, a foreigner, comes to India, and EDUCATES the local youths about their OWN history. How can people not be outraged by that? I found the idea insidious.Technically, the movie is okay.Acting-wise, everyone from ALICE PAYTON, to AAMIR, to SIDDARTH, to SOHA ALI KHAN (surprise!), etc are very good though I feel OM PURI was wasted in his small role.They should have done away with the songs. They just get in the way most of the time. Exception is the LUKA CHUPPI used to rousing effects during Ajay's funeral.The movie fails as an ode to youth, friendship, etc and at times I felt the filmmakers were trying to emulate some of the scenes and feelings one found in DIL CHAHTA HAI with the characters reveling in the lush fields and making the most of a time they know will never happen again misses the mark though and that second half almost erases all the good things in the first Very disappointing and off the mark!"
"minus 5. The movie assumes it will move the youth of India into action. If someone suddenly becomes patriotic after watching the movie, he is very likely to lose all his patriotic feelings when he sees the next Britney spears/Christina aguilera video.minus 4. Nobody seems to have anything to do, no classes to attend, no assignments to complete. This is contrary to my experiences in life, where all I see are loads of assignments, back-to-back quizzes, nightouts mugging my butt off. I seem to have missed out on loads of socializing and loafing around.minus 3. This is another movie celebrating mediocrity. Aamir Khan and his friends in the movie supposedly finished education five years ago, but all they do is 'hang out' in the college. Daljeets mother is proud that her son is a loafer. Nobody seems to be heading anywhere in life, and their acts of foolishness make celebrities out of nobody's.minus 2. This movie had the 'patriotic Muslim youth' attachment as has always been in the case. Usually, in all the cop dramas, there is this patriotic Muslim cop who is used to offset the negative image generated by the Pakistani terrorist, who happens to be Muslim. The 'patriotic Muslim guy' is Bollywoods answer to Hollywoods ""Token Black Guy"", who's just supposed to smile and stay out of the conversation and say things like: ""Damn,"" ""Shit,"" and ""That is whack."" (Not another teen movie, anyone?) minus 1. The only person I could relate to was Lakshman, the guy who played Ramprasad Bismil. He is the only guy who knows what he is doing. And he is the only guy who knows a bit about the India of the past. Made me realize I've been out of touch with my outside peers of my age group. Bah! zero. Aamir Khan was the only recognizable face (other than Soha Ali Khan, who looks a lot like her mother and brother, but is not as beautiful as Sharmila Tagore) plus 1. Catchy music. I'm currently playing the catchy tunes in my win amp right now. Be a rebel is pretty good by any standards. A R Rehmans as good as ever.plus 2. The Punjabi way of speakings pretty nice. Made a nice refreshing change. I liked it.plus 3. Aamir Khans acting. Shades of Akash from DCH (my favorite movie) are all too evident. I'm a sucker for Aamir movies, right from Andaz Apna Apna to Sarfarosh to Lagaan to DCH.plus 4. The style of storytelling, with the camera zooming from the historical hero to the protagonist playing the role was quite new, and gets the audience in the thick of action. This I liked.plus 5. The movies definitely worth a watch on the big screen. I spent 100 bucks on the ticket and consider it well spent, thanks to aamirs acting and the music."
"Let me say that I love all types of movies, but this one was just torture. The first hour is a waste of time, her accent is frustrating and the behavior of the rest of the characters is borderline obnoxious. The story about the revolutionaries was great, but you get twenty seconds of it in between five minutes of garbage. Save yourself some time and watch something else OR skip the first hour, that way you will only waste 72 minutes of your life. Its an Indian movie, believe me you'll figure out the story line even if you skip an hour. It upset me to see this movie at #3 on the top 100 list of Bollywood films. The entire story line is ridiculous, and the connection they tried making between revolutionaries fighting for freedom in a colonized India and five stupid college kids and a white girls fighting a corrupt government in 2006 was an epic fail."
"Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's attempt at making a feel good movie for the pseudo seculars. The script appears almost surrealistic at times, because of the biased and critical nature of the movie. First of lets just think this through shall we? Who would just up and decide to assassinate the defense minister of a country without even conducting a basic investigation to see if he was guilty? And to compare these nimrods with the likes of Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad? I am sensing they didn't know much about our freedom fighters other than the part about they getting hanged. Nothing of the kind that is showed in the movie happened during the right wing rule. As if their blatant crap throwing at the ideals of the conservatives weren't enough, they had to end the movie with a purely impossible logic. Who would send commandos to massacre college students? I cant believe people bought into this propaganda crap. The Migs were bought before that government came to power. So if you re going to blame someone, blame our royal family and their Italian arms dealer/friend.I do have to congratulate these people though. In showing how easily the average person can be manipulated with the help of good acting and great music(credit where it is due). This is a great way of campaigning for the ones in power. Make malicious movies about the opposition and throw dirt at them, while ban the filming of movies that show them in a bad light like the one about Jawaharlal Nehru, because it was going to portray his love affair with Lady Mountbatten."
"Simply A Brilliant Movie. People from all nationalities should watch it for the message that has been delivered.Contrary to the belief on this forum, this is not an India-centric movie. The message is universal and should be applauded.Patriotism and Freedom are universal expressions, for which we strive for even today after getting rid of the colonial rulers. However, this time we are prisoners of a different kind, wherein we need to break the shackles yet again from our fellow nationals, the enemies.The message is subtle, the acting is brilliant and the punch is heart wrenching."
"This movie is one of the best I have seen. It is beautifully directed, flows well, raises issues and suggests courses of action to give direction to youth........... all without heavy philosophizing.It brings to our attention the corruption of some of the politicians and how the consequences of their greed destroy lives but they refuse to accept responsibility. It raises issues of the fears of the youth to step out of the shelter of 'safe' college environment and their comfort zone to actually face life and take on the responsibilities of earning a living and marriage and family........ going from being 'somebody' whom everyone knows and respects to being a 'nobody' in the real world.All this is done in a humorous, poignant and subtle manner. Leaves you with hope, desire for action and a sense of direction. History repeating itself with a different cast of characters. Three hours well spent!"
"I feel my self lucky that i just realize that there are still good movies out there. Why am i lucky??? Because i have got too many titles to watch and enjoy as of today. Thank you khan thank you India. Warm, happy, mind tickling, funny... Only three days ago i was not aware of bollywood and aamir khan but know they got me and i am a fan. It was pure luck, my girlfriend somehow watched the movie online in my ipad one night, the next day while i was checking the tabs i just saw the tab for p.k. I just click the play and i was in for abt 170 mins without blinking of an eye :) i wish i should be able watch in the theater but in Turkey there is no chance so far."
"Absolutely no words required for you if you relate to India in some or the other way or know something about India or want to know something about India. Just a word of caution, this movie may keep you thinking for hours if not days and weeks. Aamir Khan, Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra, and even A. R. Rahman just contributed to shoot something as eruptive and yet gorgeous as India - more of a Before and After comparison where there is not much of a difference. Bottomline: Kudos to Mr Mehra for shooting the longest ever commercial till date. The movie sells it to you. And, hard sells!A. R. Rahman got the nerve of the movie and composed his usual best, but still nothing compared to Roja yet. Mehra got lucky and I would have prayed him if only I were to decide not to watch his other movies. Aamir gets lucky every time, he is a carefully marketed commodity which won't lose its luster in the near future, at the least."
"Now I won't really go into detail about the plot because the idea is great, honestly it alone could have made the movie pretty good. The cinema style and the realism of the movie is what got to me. Stuff like this has happened before throughout history where people take the law into their own hands for the sake of justice. For the sake of clearing corruption. Rang De Basanti makes you think. No matter what your viewpoint is on government, politics and corruption because even the characters themselves are split. This was the first movie (Not just Bollywood) that actually made me put myself into the situation of a revolutionary and in the position of a politic leader. The passion some people have for their country and the freedom of others is remarkable. Before this movie I thought about the topic only when necessary because as an American, we don't directly witness the corruption. Many don't until it's pointed out towards them. Every person in the world needs to watch this movie. Because no government is perfect, we must make it perfect. As I said before this movie will make you think and leave an after-effect for days. You might be the type to criticize the government but never do anything to actually help, there's a character for that. Even he see's what he must do and what is right, only the situation can show who can be a true revolutionary.How did it do all that? Well like I said before the plot is pretty good, it's original and it has good direction. What make this movie spectacular? The great cast and their performances is the first thing that needs to be pointed out. Alice Patten does a great job and really blends into her role more than any character. Not saying the others don't but she just does it so brilliantly. She was ideal for the role because she has the mild beauty and spark. Amir Khan obviously outshines the rest of the cast again. Can you believe this man is 46? I couldn't during the movie. I didn't once think ""Hey look at the 46 year old who has a teenage daughter my age."" because he completely melted into his character. Spectacular performance. He pretty much blended into the rest of the gang but obviously. He blended into his character who was the hardest to portray. The rest of the cast was about the same but Siddhartha did stand out. His character was the rich youth who only shows negativeness. Without these characters exactly where they needed to be...this movie might have not been so great.The second thing that made this movie stand out was the utilization of the Past-Present shift technique through colored flashbacks. It kept me entertained and both astonished at how bad the revolution was in India. The Music was excellent, I wouldn't say the movie couldn't have gotten better music but it did set a realistic mood. Thank god this wasn't a musical or all respect for the movie would have gone down. This movie shouldn't be compared to Swades. Although that is a great movie, that's what it was...just a movie. Rang De Basanti is a call for change and an eye-opener. Every Desi should watch this movie because the condition in Pakistan and Bangladesh are exactly the same as India."
"It is an excellent movie which truly reflects the growing revolutionary-youth-movement in India at present (post 2000). The problem with the MIG flight planes is long, but government has never taken any serious resolution. This movie rightly depicts the situation of a family suffering from this governmental negligence. An Indian army plot dies in a MIG accident. It brings his group of friends start thinking about the social & political problems in India which they always avoided and thought the governmental policies will never going to affect their life directly anyway. This common people's idea fired back and they even determined to give a repartee to the Indian Government. They assassinated the defense Minister and went public by Radio to announce the cause of their inhuman deed. Though the Government took it as a serious offense but their way of protests worked as an eye-opening for common people.In real life, this movie has already influenced serious public-protests against many governmental policy and some have forced the governmental to go by the public opinion. I would say it a true triumph of democracy and ""Rang De Basanti"" just plays that right tune."
"When I started watching this movie I was like this cant be a good one. About some random kids acting all over the place. But I had Amir Khans old movies in mind. The guy can really act. But just like what the other users said this isn't all about him. All other actors did an amazing job.I am myself a paki-American, being raised in a paki family and visited there I know what corruption is and what people deal with everyday. This movie does an amazing job of waking people up. Its time to wake up people, and make or break your life. I hope this gets nominated for an Oscar like Lagaan did."
"I bought this movie in Little India in Penang, Malaysia for about 2 dollars. This was money poorly spent (that could have bought me several delicious fish curries). I tried to watch it with some friends; I'm actually pretty surprised that we made it to the end. For some reason, Indian cinema seems to always fail at the strong characterization and evocative dialogue that render Iranian, Chinese, Vietnamese, and other Asian films such good alternatives to Hollywood. Every single character in this film is incredibly annoying... from the idealistic, brainless, self-hating British wannabe filmmaker (whom we're apparently supposed to admire) right down to the painfully clichéd, and indistinguishable, 'handsome party dude who only needs to be inspired to fight for freedom' types. Bogart in Casablanca these guys ain't. The constant and unnecessary 'cool' montages of partying, motorcycle riding, dances and so on are actually much more annoying than your standard Bollywood musical set-piece. Finally--and most importantly--what exactly is it that these morons are fighting for? Capitalist modern India, which the wealthy leftist filmmakers naturally s**t all over, is massively superior to the socialist basket case that came before, as demonstrated by the untold millions lining these actors' and directors' pockets. So there's corruption, obviously, but this isn't quite a reason for a bunch of indolent college students to attempt to take over the country through murdering ministers (as well as one guy's evil capitalist caricature father? why?). Anyway, at this point I'm rambling. This award-winning film (very perplexing) is right up there with ""You Got Served.. Again"" and ""The Fast and the Furious 3: Tokyo Drift"" in my book. Cheers, big ears."
"Of late, Bollywood movies are awakening to shed its chocolate-movies image. Passionate and patriotic movies such as Indian, Fiza, Sarfarosh, Swades, and etc have intermittently showed the glitters of Bollywood - propagating that Bollywood too can produce inspiring and refreshing movies. But Rang De Basanti (RDB) cannot be called a movie. It is something more, has transcended the realm of a movie-zone (to be precise, Bollywood movie-zone). After watching the RDB (I don't want to categorize it as a movie) no one can or should say that Bollywood movies are just laden with huge costumes, dances, unrealistic and dramatized characters.RDB is so refreshing in all its facets that it makes you think differently. SMS generation deems any message with more than four-lines as a lecture. So the generation needs to be admonished differently, and the way the parallels drawn from the Freedom struggle from aliens with the current Freedom struggle from your own bureaucracy stands out tall among other all-beautiful-tenets of this RDB.Amir Khan is a delight to watch in RDB. Amir Khan's crying because of his helplessness in just being a spectator to the Rapid Action Force's lathi-charge on the silent revolutionaries sums out the veritable young Indian citizen's anguish. The frolic and fun-filled youth belie the very serious resolution they possess. Sidharth's role is controlled and yet most powerful. He conveys a youth's ideals and executes their wish to the hilt.Hats off to the director, Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, for making such a wonderful bigger-than-a-movie called RDB. RDB would surely lift the Bollywood to new heights. Rahman's music and taut screenplay gels perfectly with the movie. Special mention has to be made about Soha Ali Khan and Alice Payton (played as Sue). They both are stunning. They are far better than the aspiring (obviously Miss World/Universe beauty queens) and most of the current female actresses."
"Words fall short when the time comes to parlay my emotional state in order to describe the film. What starts as a breath of youthful exuberance, matures into an impassioned flame of truth only to be snubbed when the flame blazes in all it's glory. This is a kind of cinema that shakes a person to its core.We begin with a look to India at the time of The Raj, and are introduced to an English jail officer guarding the Freedom Fighters of Hind. Form there beings the tale of Sue in modern times, who is wanting to make a documentary about the Freedom Fighters of Hind and her Grandfather the jailer in charge of the Freedom Fighters.

"I have watched this movie twice and undoubtedly i rank this movie as one of the best movie I have ever seen. This movie makes a parallel comment on India's Freedom Fighting Movement and 21st century youth. There lies a rebellion in all of us and it just requires a triggering moment to stand against corruption, bureaucracy and envisage patriotism in your heart.It's not about remembering freedom fighters but a metamorphism of those patriotic into today's youth. Few youths thinks that freedom movement is dead in Indian history and just limited to books but later on they realize that we want another freedom movement against corruption and bureaucracy.All songs are beautifully choreographed and a marvelous performance by all characters."
"i went for this movie with a lot of high expectations, and i dreaded the possibility of it being disliked. but it hasn't let me down...there were times where i was left open-mouthed and wide-eyed while watching this film...it hits you hard in the face...it gives you a very natural projection of the youth of India...those who are more interested in partying than anything else, and how their eyes open and stare at their country. extremely patriotic and very moving, this film is going to be one among the best films in Indian movie history. all the actors gave us stunning performances and aamir was simply superb. the direction was awesome and...i just have no words to express...this is an amazing movie...and if you haven't watched yet, then i think you're one of the most sad people in India, literally...watch it..now.."
"Beyond doubt, we all acknowledge the power of art to wake up inert souls. However it is a very thin line for one to cross from the desired goal of inspiring and overwhelming into soul less preaching So to that end, Rang de basanti, does cause a lump in your throat, a resonating call in your heart and certain empathy for the five likable, very different characters of this story, without ever lapsing into either maudlin sentiments or moralizing to bring to the fore the plague called corruption sweeping India. The revolutionaries of Indian freedom struggle (Bhagat Singh and Co) represent the righteousness and courage of the past and they seep into the five modern day characters who are jolted from their lackadaisical and somnolent day to day existence. Fate brings few college friends into contact with Sue a young penniless documentary film maker who cannot afford professional actors. The sacrifices and tribulations of the freedom fighters does leave a mark some where deep within the consciousness of the five friends. All it takes is a horrendous tragedy which then makes them take steps never contemplated before. The focus is on the moral awakening, the call for justice and not on the consequences of the drastic actions of the youth while attempting to make corrupt politicians and businessmen pay for their deeds. Aamir is magnetic and powerful in his role as events transform him from a college vagabond fearing reality of life and seeking solace in the four walls of a university to someone gripped by painful awakening of conscience. Each and every character (Siddharth, Soha, Madhavan, Atul, Sharman) essay their roles with consummate ease. The background score and cinematography is indicative of the new breed of technicians in Bollywood, slick and effective. The end is not pleasing to the mind or eye and is disproportionately brief but then one suspects that the director never wanted the end to be the fulcrum or highlight. It is in the narrative of the lives of the youth from pre to post a tragedy that remains as the food for thought. A very nice movie, well intentioned, and truly aimed at what the byline says "" A generation awakens"". Much needed for a nation which is showing clear signs of awakening. To pick faults would be to talk about script losing its tautness somewhere in between halfway and end, one song too many, a shallow probe into the malaise called corruption in Indian social and political setting. But then we all know the tumour exists, what is genuinely needed is a courage to pluck it out each and every time to prevent it from raising its head. The film I believe is in that respect will for sure strike a chord in the youth across the nation."
"Awesome performances by everyone i would say .Soha was really graceful and AR Rehman stole the show with rocking music .......all in all a wonderful movie to watch ...Aamir yet again doing it..NO SURPRISES!!!!!!!!I guess it was expected .The direction was also up to the mark.The team as a whole look united at every moment and it was clearly reflected that they had done their homework .Aamir's new hairstyles was good for a change.Kirron also added a bit of humor along with Sherman who can been be seen really growing with every film he is doing.Soha has really shown that she has the potential to make a mark ,now we just have to wait and watch how she handles the success and carry forward."
"What can one expect when artists of high caliber work together and try to make something unconventional? It has been seen in the past that they usually falter (according to the box-office)! Take for instance movies ahead of their times such AKS! The movie was brilliantly made ... technically sound and with a well said story. Yet it seemed indigestible most of the viewers! Going into the theater to watch Rang De Basanti (RDB), did not create doubts in my mind that it would be unconventional, yet for some reason I had this urge to measure it against Dil Chahta Hai (being a very commercial film -- But 6.5/10); perhaps due to the campus life stressed on by the promotions. Once the ride began, I was in splits by the time the movie had an interval. Sharman Joshi (Godmother, Style) being the naturally comic maestro, was the source of this and well supported by Aamir Khan (Lagaan) in the department. Serious sentiments were stimulated by Atul Kulkarni (Page 3) and Kunal Kapoor (Meenaxi: Tale of 3 Cities) once in a while (Hindu Kulkarni disliking the Muslim Kapoor). Alice Patton should be proud of her excellent dialog delivery in Hindi (fine acting too) ... Soha Ali Khan (Antar Mahal) was apt till the interval but quite an actress in the later parts. Siddharth (Boys) was the perfect actor cast as the carefree and aimless son of an official military dealer, Anupam Kher(Saraansh, Maine Gandhi ko Nahin Maara) who just wants to leave the country because of the going-ons in this day and age (read ""the system"").Post-interval the movie deflects into a totally different direction due to R. Madhavan's (Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein) death and the subsequent events that unfold! Aamir Khan touches the audience with the sentiments and with the brilliant mix of humor thrown in here and there. In fact since all the actors were so good I would like to elaborate, but it would be a waste of space ;) Overall, RDB is very well made. Youngsters can identify themselves here and so can those who have delved deep into corruption. In fact the movie has the power to make people have second thoughts to induce/accept illegality. Finally, the movie has a very unconventional ending; the sort I was hoping for. I was not sure how the campus culture could be shown gelling in with the 'Indian struggle for Independence story', but to my surprise, Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra (AKS) pulls it off, in a grand style!! Hats off mate! Easily one of my top ten favorite Hindi movies. I give it an 8/10."
"Come on, haven't we saw enough of Aamir Khan playing patriotic character who is rebellious and also is loved by a British lady. We know LAGAAN was a great movie but everything that followed this genre plain sucked; The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey and now this. I start watching this movie and 10 minutes later I found myself watching BLUFFMASTER cause RANG DE BASANTI had nothing new. Aamir's acting was so so. I saw much better performance from him in his past movies. I did like Soha Ali Khan's performance. Alice Patten did a wonderful job both in acting and speaking Hindi. Music by A.R. Rehman was pretty good too. Other than that a crappy crappy movie. Aamir Khan should work on some new scripts and stay away from anything that has any connection with British people."
"A young woman from England (Alice Patten) comes to India to make a documentary about her grandfather's diary which was written in the 1920s about the Indian Independence with five young men.I probably missed something, because this film has had a tremendous influence and incredible positive criticism, whereas I saw a bunch of poor acting (particularly from Patten) and some over-the-top Bollywood singing and dancing. Some of the music was good, but overall this just seemed too cheesy to be taken seriously.I would watch the film again to try and understand it better, but that may never happen. It is just so long and difficult to appreciate."
"A nice concept, gone awry. It could have been treated much more effectively and with much greater subtlety. The youngsters acting in the documentary was only a part of the movie, and it could easily be inferred that the youngsters were acting out history in the present situation, and there was no need to show flashes from the documentary. To show Bhagat Singh, and Chandrashekhar Azad, and Sukhdeo again was not required at all! What was the director thinking? Was he planning to make this movie for kids? Well, even kids could've understood without this display. And the dialogs were, to put it bluntly, poorly written. Nowhere could I relate to the movie in any way, and it seemed as if the group was 'acting', as opposed to movies like Dil Chahta Hai, where the conversations seemed more 'real'.Very nice songs, and decent cinematography. Also, good acting by the actors, especially in the later parts of the movie. But could've been a much better movie."
"I just don't know why this movie is a hit and got so many awards it was so boring and simply impossible to watch. I rented it and I started to dislike it after 5 minutes of viewing time but still I was watching it to save the money I spent. It was complete nonsense first a white girl appeared in India and met Aamir Khan who was drinking with his friends on top of a bridge and placed a bet that who ever falls of first into the water is a loser, then he started dancing stupidly with the girl by shaking his waist then his head. After that I couldn't take it anymore and I asked my dad that ""can I eject the DVD now?"" and he replied ""I'm glad you asked"". My dad is really keen in films like Lagaan & Swades and he couldn't even watch it and I wanted to save myself rather than my money. The film is made by the same crappy director who also made the weird Aks and it takes a genius to make a movie this bad. Thank goodness that Rang de basanti did not get a Bafta award."
"OK, i liked the movie but only in parts. The first half was fantastic but the second half was a clichéd. The concept of a British filmmaker going to India to make a documentary film on its history while the people there don't care until...I really liked this idea. A.R. Rahman's music is wonderful and as always, flows beautifully with the movie. Cinematography and direction are well done. Another thing that works really well is the performances. Each and everyone did well with their roles. Those who stand out are Alice Patton, Atul Kulkarni, Siddharth, Sharman Joshi, Aamir Khan, Kunal Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman (in spite of having a tiny part). Even though Aamir Khan is a superstar in India, his role was just as important as the other's (unlike his previous movie, Fanaa). I'm glad he did this film without taking the importance away from the other characters but he is a little too old for the part. Lastly, this is an alright film and I certainly wouldn't call it the best movie that has been made dealing with this subject matter."
"One of the best movies of the past few years. Finally a movie talking about contemporary issues, and about young people who believe in something. This was my first Bollywood movie and I really enjoyed being ""cast"" in a world I barely know. The movie goes through several interesting themes, like clash of cultures (Muslims in India), a love story, contemporary Indian politics, family values... but everything is ""interwoven"" in a clever way so that you don't lose track. The plot is also good and not predictable. I am so tired of watching movies that tell nothing new, with actors that put no passion, and stories that you saw a hundred times already. I am also tired of the absence of ""ideals"", of ""big"" issues, not only in movies but in general. This movie was surprising and bold."
"I don't know why people liked this movie. a tapori is compared with bhagat singh.. and basically the yo man crowd who didn't know much about the freedom struggle and has poor or little reading liked it to make a fashion statement. speaks of intellectual shallowness of south Asia. when bollywood meets history, it better be objective, else though it might be a money spinner, it will suck and will show the shallowness of the makers and the jahil yo mans who like such stuff. if you want to see how the movies in historical context be made watch bhagat singh or bose.. even ghulam though average as a movie had things right in the historical perspective and then there is great 1942 a love stroy."
"Given the kind of response Rang De Basanti has got, one dissenting review is probably going to make no dent on the mass of celebratory reviews here and all over the internet. But then the itself movie is about rebellion, so here goes..With an amazing amount of hype surrounding it, the best mainstream actor in the country at its helm and an immensely evocative tag line - ""a generation awakens"", Rang De Basanti had to be one of the best Hindi movies in recent times. However, I came out of the cinema hall disappointed. First off, the movie's politics is way too simplistic and is marked by Bollywood's characteristic lack of interest in the complexities of how the State functions. If you believe the movie, each politician is a devil whose evil deeds permeate every nook and corner of the country. The government has never done anything good and it'll always remain the same (unless you assassinate one of the big devils). So, while the movie deserves credit for criticizing fundamentalists and hate mongers, it seems to be going on a chauvinistic trip of its own. The problem with Rang De Basanti is not that it points out that things are going wrong with our country. The same story with all its action and melodrama could have been used to effectively portray the urgency of change. The problem is with impression it creates - simplistic and over the top, reminiscent of the mind of a lynch mob.Then, the movie lacks what one can best call ""personal moments"". This is a movie about a group of people and finally about the whole country. Individuals don't have much of a place in it. The few moments where they do take a precedence add soul to the movie, such as Laxman's recitation of Ram Prasad Bismil's ""sarfaroshi ki tamanna"" or Waheeda Rahman's mourning over her son's death. Even if one is disenchanted by the course of action the protagonists adopt, one could have been made to identify with and care about what happens to them. But unlike the thoughtful and mature characterisations of Dil Chahta Hai, here the writers show a propensity towards the outer world rather than the inner.On the bright side, A R Rahman has composed a dazzling soundtrack with some unique and earthy lyrics by Prasoon Joshi (though all the songs heavily edited in the movie). The director and cinematographer seem to be having a lot of fun with the robust and trance-like portrayal of the gang's antics in and around Delhi. The movie exudes a young and restless aura. As one reviewer puts it, this is Rakeysh Mehra's ode to Delhi. The actors mostly do a fair job, with Aamir Khan and Atul Kulkarni coming up with the best performances. Kulkarni surely has a knack to play the passionate Hindutva fundamentalist rather well, this performance reminding one of his chilling portrayal of Savarkar in Hey Ram.With some subtlety, Rang De Basanti could have been path-breaking and transformative. But it fails. Even among those who loved the movie (and that surely includes a lot of people), how many will care to add their bit to the nation and how many have returned to their private dreams where the only reaction to the country's affairs is one of cynicism? How many of them will even care to vote? Oh no, I forgot that voting won't do and what we need is an assassination followed by a radio confession, just before the devil's henchmen arrive to snuff your life out.So for those who prefer their idealism without the naiveté and the theatrics, steer clear of Rang De Basanti. There are always movies such as Dhoop and Saransh..."
"Amir khan is a fine actor but not only him, every actor in the movie has done justice to their character. Even after it being an awesome movie I think that there were a few drawbacks. There was absolutely no need to kill them in the end. Just because Bhagat Singh and his friends died for this country, you don't have to necessarily die. You can live and still do a lot of things for your country. If you give a message to the youngsters in your country, that you have to die and sacrifice your life to open other peoples eyes, it will be a wrong message. Then they will never think about bringing any changes, cause no one wants to die. I would have liked the movie better if they would have altered the end. Even though Aamir is my favorite actor, I would definitely like to say that the film is a little overrated."
"I really really liked the movie, especially the ending of the movie. The movie is all about trying to change the system, the way we think, to leave a mark in the society & to live what the freedom fighters have lived thru. I would say Rakeysh has done a gr8 job with the movie, but he takes a lot of time to get to the movie's actual story, which begins only after 1.5 hours into the movie.Acting is first rate, and the movie belongs to all the actors who starred along with Aamir. I would say they really overshadowed him. N surprise surprise, he is not the central character in the movie... to find it out, go watch the movie... U wont be disappointed.A must watch..."
