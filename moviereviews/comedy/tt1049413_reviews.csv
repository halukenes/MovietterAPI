"If there's a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It'd be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I'd place it among so much stellar work.Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you're looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it's the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There's an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don't feel gives anything away. It's pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn't make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you're reminded of it, but I suppose it's up to one's own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don't really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that's just simply unprecedented. I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn't really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you're better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn't take away from Up mind you, it just didn't add to it either. Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It's pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we're entitled to the entertainment. It's nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don't know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie."
"I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special pre-release screening of Up at Pixar studios in Emeryville, organized by the San Francisco Film Society. After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar's new high water mark, Up.My favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl's life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no ""new"" technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.As the associate producer who participated in the Q&A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they'll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar's commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here. All of the good press is true, and I can't wait to see it again. Thanks for staying true to yourselves Pixar!"
"Honestly, I found the DVD of this film in my house and decided to give it a watch as I had nothing better to do. Truth is I really should have made the time before.Although I enjoy all the other Disney/pixar movies, I am at that teenage age where I mainly seek Violence, sex and gore. Thankfully my teenage boredom did me a big favour in helping what this fantastic masterpiece. This film was so fantastically deep, meaningful and moving beyond relief, as soon as I switched it off I rang my grandparents to tell them I love them.It should be made necessary that everyone everywhere should see this film and I think the world would be a much better place - it really is that good.100/10"
"Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a ""bird"" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.10/10."
"UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.The one clue I can give away – because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise – is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting – perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that – at least in the audience I was in – when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie – particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action – nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle ""Bambi,"" this film should be a breeze."
"I was luckily able to catch a screening a few weeks ago here in Houston.As an avid lover of Wall-E, I felt Pixar could never reach those heights again.I was wrong.UP's story will probably seem peculiar at first glance. An old man as a protagonist? It definitely blew my expectations. The first 5 minutes demolished every other Pixar feature just because it was the first time I cried in a theater.This just shows how much heart there is to the movie. I really don't want to get into specifics because of spoilers but the movie literally has everything.Amazing visual effects.Amazing sound.Hilarious comedy.Breath taking action.Heart.All those combined equal something special. Today's movies like to blow you away with gimmicks, Pixar is different. Each movie shows soul and UP definitely has it.I can't wait until it comes out so I can see it in 3d, im bringing everybody.10/10"
"This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork. Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong. Everyone - regardless of age - will have their jaw drop more than once viewing the incredible-looking scenes. It's really a feast for the eyes. Finally, if you like extras, there are tons of them in the four-disc DVD set."
"Seriously, I'm convinced, Pixar is maybe the only movie studio that is providing the best movies around. Who said that animated films can't be considered real movies? Can't be considered an art form? Up is the latest creation from Disney and Pixar, after last year's smash hit WALL-E, I felt like they couldn't at all top themselves and they did it again with this incredibly charming story. Admittingly from the trailer, I wasn't sure this story was going to work as well, but I got the opportunity to see Up this week and was just totally blown away by it's story, animation and characters. The thing I adore about these movies that Disney and Pixar are creating is that they're not just for the kids, but the adults as well, this is something that I could even see an adult seeing by themselves. This story doesn't insult kid's intelligence and is extremely entertaining for anyone to enjoy, to go through this adventure with an old man who just wanted to make his wife happy.Carl Fredricksen, a quiet young boy, meets Ellie in her clubhouse, discovering together they share the same interest in exploration as their hero, famed explorer Charles F. Muntz. Ellie expresses her desire to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America, a promise she makes Carl keep. Carl and Ellie fall in love, wed and grow old together in the old house where they first met. Ellie dies of old age before they can take their trip, leaving Carl living alone in their home. After a tussle with a construction worker over Carl's broken mailbox, the court orders Carl to move into a retirement home. Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and creates a makeshift airship using thousands of helium balloons which lift his house off its foundation. Russell, a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a snipe hunt by Carl the day before. After a storm throws them around for a while, they find themselves across a large ravine facing Paradise Falls. With their body weight providing ballast allowing Carl and Russell to pull the floating house, the two begin to walk around the ravine. As they walk towards Paradise Falls, Russell finds a colorful tropical bird which he names Kevin, not realizing that the bird is actually female. They later run into a dog with a translating collar named Dug. They discover Dug's owner is Charles Muntz, who has remained in South America for several decades to find a bird like Kevin in order to restore his reputation after bringing back a skeleton and being called a fraud. Though Carl is initially thrilled to meet his hero, when he realizes that Muntz is after Kevin and will kill to obtain her, Carl takes steps to save the bird and escape from Muntz.Up is seriously the best movie I have seen so far this year, it's actually one of my favorite movies of all time, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this film. Wither it was the fun and charming story between Carl and Russell, the crazy bird Kevin, or the story that nearly killed me in laughter, the dogs that have collars that make them talk. I don't remember the last time a movie that made me laugh so hard that my stomach hurt, it also made me tear up and smile. If someone ever tells you that an animated film can't be considered a real movie, just show them Up. I absolutely adore this movie, can't wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it again. This is a perfect family film, actually scratch that, it's a perfect film, the animation is incredible, the characters are lovable and the story is magical. Up is going to be a film to be remembered for all time, great movie, go see it.10/10"
"Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.I am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along. You will be entertained, delighted and moved."
"Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted 'talking' dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.This isn't slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.Visually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can't help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.I have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.Anyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.Up is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!"
"If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film. Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest, anything else from this year - to reach the level of quality of this year's first animated film, Coraline (which, along with last year's Bolt and Wall-E, became one of my favorite films of all time). Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.Easily the most emotionally impactful portion of the entire film, the first ten to fifteen minutes of Up are nothing short of beautiful. Using little to no dialogue, the opening ""montage"" of this film tells the story of Carl and his wife Ellie, and the wonderful life that they share together. Carl is such a lovable character, that you feel for him from the very beginning. Without trying to come off as cliché or anything, you feel the joy that he feels, and when his wife passes away, you feel his loss. By the end of the whole sequence, I was in tears.This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor. Dug the dog (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson) is especially hilarious every single time that he ""opens his mouth"", and yet still proves to be a key part of this emotional roller coaster ride. The movie also does a terrific job at making you feel a sense of wonder, and you just buy into the adventure of these two characters. Finally, I want to give a special nod to Christopher Plummer as the famous wilderness explorer, Charles Muntz, who is easily my favorite Pixar villain.I love Up. Go see it now, as my review just can't do it justice. Not only is it extremely entertaining, but also gut-bustingly hilarious, and beautifully told throughout. To quote John Campea of TheMovieBlog.com, ""The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that it ended."" The result is a film that's on par with Wall-E and The Incredibles as my favorite Pixar movie to date (which, again, is saying a hell of a lot, considering that they're two of my top 10 favorite films of all time) and while it may take a couple more viewings to say for certain, I have no qualms with saying that Up is one of the finest films I've ever seen."
"What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.The movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.Just brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of ""robot"" dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.Up is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10."
"""Up"" is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on ""Monsters Inc"", a writer on ""Toy Story"" and a co-writer and director on ""Wall*E."" Peterson was a writer on ""Finding Nemo"". Both know the guidelines for success and while ""Up"" doesn't reach the heights of say a ""Wall*E"" or a ""Toy Story"", it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.This one is about Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), a 78-year old retired balloon salesman living alone in a house full of old memories. Carl and his wife Ellie met each other as young children, both enamored by the newsreels about adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They eventually married and planned on seeing the world together, especially Paradise Falls in South America, but life kept getting in the way and before he knew it, Ellie died.As the world changes, Carl refuses to change with it. When developers threaten to move him out of his house and into a retirement home, the old codger rigs his house up with thousands of balloons and before you can say ""way to go Carl"", he floats away, determined to have the adventure he and his wife never had. He doesn't plan on taking 8-year old chubby wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) with him or crash landing on the other side of Paradise Falls, or finding an exotic female snipe (that Russell names Kevin) or a group of talking dogs (one named Dug befriends them) tracking down the bird for Muntz, who it turns out is a sinister villain, but things kinda turn out that way.You're grabbed instantly. The adorable opening montage of the Carl and Ellie love story is more endearing and moving in its dialogue-less 10-minute entirety than any other romance this year by a long shot. This is another Pixar flick that goes in a daring direction. We next see Carl as a heartbreaking old man, his wife dead and the world no longer needing him. You forgive him his bitterness and you love him for the sentimental streak he has towards the things he and his wife shared together. His crabbiness is a little funny but there are also some heavy scenes early on as well. It sets up a beautiful, multi-layered story about enduring love and learning to live life without limits.When a thrilling rainstorm crashes Carl and Russell on the other side of Paradise Falls, the two must each harness themselves to the house floating above them. The characters each look terrific and share a good chemistry. Russell is the usual 8-year old kid, talkative, inquisitive, and annoyingly overeager. He is a good comic foil to crabby Carl, his big, rosey smile and plump round stature a counter to the stout, frowningly square-faced Carl. As the two spend more time together, a wonderfully written friendship develops.The movie is full of visual gags and the talking dog-henchmen are great fun. Muntz, an adventurer who travels around the world in a big blimp, offers a menacingly evil villain to chase Carl and Russell through rough mountainous terrain before the exciting final house vs. blimp in-air showdown. Plus the movie looks fantastic, a lush array of candy color and grand scenery. And the vocal cast, from Edward Asner to Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai each deftly voice their roles. ""Up"" is one of the year's rare treasures, a movie that flies in every way possible and from Pixar, you shouldn't expect anything less."
"Pixar has become the most dependable studio out there for producing reliable films that don't simply continue to raise the bar in animation but set a level of excellence in storytelling that puts most live-action movies to shame. 'Up' represents another change in style, as significant as Wall-E's shift to photorealism, intricate camera effects and darker themes. It effectively blends moments of tragedy with almost slapstick humor, while showing that their understanding of story structure and pacing gets more refined with every release.Up is about a 70-something ex-balloon salesman who fulfills a lifelong dream of adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his house and flying away to South America. This trip, inspired by his adventure- loving wife who dies before their dream is realized, is forced when property developers attempt a compulsory purchase on his house and try to move him to a retirement home (issues of death and eminent domain in a cartoon?). The problem is that he has an enthusiastic - and fatherless - 8-year old Wildness Explorer stowed away on the property when it takes off. Their adventure focuses on the characters they meet along the way, while our hero Carl is still trying to drag his house to the dream destination at the top of a waterfall.The opening shows the life of Carl, growing from an young boy, meeting his adventuring-loving girlfriend, their marriage and her death just before their adventure starts - it's an incredibly emotional 5-minute intro that's light on dialog and heavy on visuals, and didn't leave a dry eye in the theater. This sequence in particular was reminiscent of the dialog-free sections of Wall-E which deliver their plot punches without exposition or the need for endless sequences that would take twice as long in live action. But this approach doesn't leave the younger audience behind either, and for such a dark start, all I could see in the audience were kids and adults alike glued to the screen.I won't give away any more plot details since the film doesn't open for another three weeks, but every scene and character trait is meticulously plotted so that nothing seems too ridiculous or contrived, even for such a fantastic journey. The graphic stylization is also fresh, in the same way that The Incredibles had a very distinct and authentic look. All of this serves to heighten the humor and there are some extremely funny scenes, helped by the way the characters are quickly and believably established (even the talking dogs, but you'll see what I mean).This is the second time I've been to Pixar to see a pre-release of a movie and I felt a little scared before seeing this one, wondering if their run of first-class work may have hit a plateau. On the surface, I didn't really think a story about a senior in a flying house could live up to Wall-E, yet although the films are as different as they can be, Up is as gripping and entertaining as any Pixar film. Their ability to blends styles and take the audience from laughter to tears in minutes showcases their deep understanding of story, and it's a shame that more films aren't crafted the same way.Up opens on May 29, and I highly recommend it to everyone. The next two films out of Pixar will be Toy Story 3 (2010) and Cars 2 (2011). By the way, look at for a very funny short film before Up called Partly Cloudly."
"In terms of animated features, Pixar ventures where very few other animated films have gone before and that is to delve into the lives of the elderly generation. In fact, having any film (animated or not) examine what it is like to grow old and the roller coaster ride that is life would normally mean you are in for some heavy material indeed. This is because true depictions of life are not constantly joyful and grand, it is always hand in hand with tears and hardships. In this respect, Pixar are to be applauded to have dared create a ""kids"" film that explores the circle of life in all its vivid glory and personal heartache.Those who have scored UP poorly have undoubtedly felt misled, disappointed or even cheated because oftentimes when one thinks of Pixar, one thinks of imaginative explorations of what it would be like if our toys were alive (Toy Story 1 and 2), or if cars could talk (Cars), or if a mouse wanted to be a gourmet chef (Ratatouille), or how a family attempts to be ""normal"" when they all have superpowers (The Incredibles). Previous Pixar stories have always reached the realms of ""brilliant"" because these imaginative explorations are balanced with plot depth, humor and characters which audiences connect to and cheer for. Whether it's an ant trying to show his colony that they should stand up to the grasshoppers (A Bug's Life) or a humble cleaning robot guiding humanity home and trying to find love (Wall-E), all Pixar films are both fantastical and deeply meaningful thus showing their movies are more than just eye candy.And this is where UP has divided the people. Don't get me wrong, UP has the fantastical and the deeply meaningful in spades, the difference here is that Pixar explores these to the extreme.Flying a house to South America using thousands of balloons, dogs with futuristic collars that allow them to translate their ""dog"" language into English (or any other human language) and lest not forget they can also cook, a mythical rainbow colored bird and an old man who uses a walking stick in the first half of the film but can do ""Indiana Jones""-like feats in the second half of the film - Fantastical? CHECK.Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they marry, they discover they can't have children, they grow old together, wife dies, old man lives alone in house which he calls by his wife's name while high rise buildings are being constructed around him, old man attempts to fulfill promise to his deceased wife by flying to South America taking the house with him, and all that doesn't even cover the background story of the boy scout (who's father has left him and now only lives with his mum) who tries to help the old man out - Deeply meaningful? CHECK.The daring exploration by Pixar of both these fantastical and meaningful themes has resulted in a beautiful, at times humorous, oftentimes heart-wrenching and flawed (but not necessarily in a bad way) film.Never before has Pixar challenged the audience to such a level. Are you able to suspend belief to the point where you can believe a house can be lifted off by thousands of helium filled kids balloons and yet at the same time be willing to invest in an old man (who himself is flawed in more ways than one) and experience both the pain of love lost and the goal of hope found? Will parents be willing to explain to their young children about life and death? Will kids understand the adult themes? Will adults enjoy the ride or will they feel the movie is too depressing and the events too unbelievable? These are the questions which Pixar has dared audiences to confront.As for me, I enjoyed the film, I laughed during the bits where you're meant to laugh, and I was moved to tears during the bits where you were meant to be moved (especially the beginning which shows the fast forward life of old man Carl). I struggled at times with suspending my belief of the events in the second half; how both Carl and Russell (the boy scout) manage to do the physically astounding is not to be thought about in depth. All in all, a brave film by Pixar that doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of brilliance but if looked at from above has many lessons to be learned and perhaps, just perhaps examines the flaws in all of us (especially as we get older) and how we should all try to reach UP to greater heights."
"Sadly, there aren't enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how I've long been adverse to ""kids movies"", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's The Incredibles and 2008's WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.If you're thinking this isn't the usual stuff you see in ""kids movies"" you're right. But all credit is due to Pixar and the directorial and writing team of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for realizing that children aren't idiots, and can handle complex, often tragic stories, if conveyed in the proper manner. It's a refreshing change from the over-protective mentality that once saw all hints of violence edited out of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.In Up, characters bleed, there's implied murder, and it's all counter-balanced with some of the most delightfully twisted humor that's as inspired as anything the Zucker brothers ever came up with. The story literally had me careening from being misty-eyed to laughing heartily, frequently in the span of minutes.Faced with forced relocation to a retirement home, Carl opts for one final gambit, to fly his house down to Paradise Falls with the aid of a multitude of helium-filled balloons affixed to the roof of his house. Along for the ride is Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Scout seeking to add a merit badge to his collection. Eventually the duo are complimented by Dug (voiced by co-director and writer Bob Peterson) a dopey derelict dog equipped by the now aged Muntz with a translator collar that converts dog thoughts to English.Like WALL-E, Up manages to imbue its characters with depth and humanity, while at the same time tell a story that is mature, delightful, and most of all, terrifically funny. In an era when Hollywood seems only capable of re-boots and do-overs, Up is not merely a refreshing stroke of original brilliance, it is likely the best movie you will see all year.... or until Pixar emerges with their next effort."
"""Up"" may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us ""Wall-E"" and before that ""Ratatouille."" ""Up"" suffers in comparison to those films, and happily resigns itself from 'good Pixar' to regular good.The story follows reluctant protagonist Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old balloon salesman, who along with his now-departed wife, always dreamt of flying to adventure in Paradise Falls, South America. During a moving, poignant montage of his life, it becomes clear that the opportunity for adventure is passing the couple by. So when the widower Carl is sued and his home threatened, he takes the opportunity to take off, the house held afloat by thousands upon thousands of colorful balloons for the adventure he never had. All goes according to plan until he discovers Russell, an overeager ""wilderness explorer,"" has stowed away beneath his porch.The second act is the film's weakest, and the adventure advertised boils down to a few paltry miles. After a brief storm sequence, the unlikely pair find themselves on the other side of the canyon, but nevertheless ""three days"" from Paradise Falls. With the floating home strapped to their backs, Carl and Russell begin their trek, only to be sidetracked by the obligatory supporting characters, amusing though they may be: ""Kevin"" a fictional female dodo-like bird with hilarious favoritism, and ""Doug"" a golden retriever with a dog-to-English translation collar.Where the film finds itself in trouble is in keeping the established themes at the forefront of the story when the arbitrary sequence of events in the second act unfold. The villain, Carl's childhood idol (which makes this guy how old?), a disgraced adventurer by the name of Charles Muntz, is the perfect match as a man who's been corrupted by his dreams, but he's never developed to a satisfying level and receives relatively little screen time.Muntz's minions are a wellspring of only occasionally successful gags, an armada of translation-collared dogs tasked with hunting down Carl, Russell, and most importantly, Kevin. Their presence in the film feels somewhat random, and not quite funny enough to justify. It's becoming an ironically dirty word in reference to Pixar's work, but it all feels a little too cartoony.The visuals are as strong as the best Pixar has offered, though shot composition gives everything a sort of flat feel to it (a problem perhaps 3-D was meant to rectify), with characters seldom moving on more than one plane, leaving the environments feeling oddly like stage backdrops.""Up"" is sadly Pixar's last original film until 2013, but with its glaring screenplay problems, it may be for the best that the studio recharge its creative cannons. After ten feature films, nine completely original, it's hard to leverage complaints against ""Up"" greater than that it simply isn't their best work. It may not be the revelation that ""Ratatouille"" or ""Wall-E"" were, but middle of the road Pixar is still worth the price of admission."
"LOOOVED this movie.I found it so enjoyable to watch and actually had tears in my eyes from a particular scene which included a Doberman (won't say more). I also teared up from an emotional, tender scene with Carl and Ellie.The animation breathtaking, extremely funny and quirky too. It didn't pander to children i.e a kiddy movie, but made sure it entertained 'kids' of all ages.I actually wondered if the writers of this movie got together one night for pizza and beers and penned out this movie whilst a little intoxicated. It's got some seriously good laughs!Can't wait for it to come out on DVD.I highly recommend this movie."
Up is wonderful and well written story that is very well animated for its time. It stands out from other movies not only due to its animation technology but through the uses of character archetypes. Along some ingenious planning throughout the movie which will certainly grip you on your seat for the whole time. Each part of the story fits together seamlessly and as directed by Pete Docter who has shown potential in the past with Monster.Inc. It is no surprise that Up would not have been better. Easter Eggs are bound to be found as this is just another part of the Pixar and Disney family. It ended very gracefully with a happy ending for the two main and primary characters that lies within the movie. I am very glad that I had spent my time and money to watch this exquisite animation. It is well made and deserves to be recommended if you are seeking the adventure that lies beyond the unreachable.
"As I am much more hesitant to give a movie a score of 10 than most reviewers, take my score of 9 as a ringing endorsement for this sweet CGI film from Pixar. In addition, the film is the first 3-D film by the studio and it looked lovely.The film begins with a sweet but VERY emotionally draining prologue. You see Carl Fredricksen as a very young boy along with his first two loves--the adventures of the explorer, Charles Muntz, and his meeting and falling in love with Ellie. All this is done with a minimum of dialog and it is one of the sweetest segments I've seen in years--and is a first for something this deep and emotional from a computer generated film. Keep a few Kleenex nearby--you'll likely need it.Then, the film jumps ahead to the present day. Carl is now elderly and alone. His life is quite sad and he dwells on the recent loss of Ellie. Fortunately, the film doesn't dwell on this too long or become maudlin--though it did come a bit close at times. Now, with nothing in his life other than memories AND the court pushing him into a retirement home against his will, Carl comes up with a crazy plan--to float his home away with a bazillion balloons and take it to South America!! Unfortunately, while the plan works, Carl also gets an unwelcome passenger (Russell). Now Russell is an absolutely adorable character--wonderfully rendered and with a fittingly cute voice. You cannot help but love him. But, since Carl is alone and childless and grumpy, he is less than enthralled with this hitchhiker.Eventually, they arrive in South America and meet some new friends--a bizarre giant bird and Dug, the dog. But, being a family film, you KNOW that there must be some villain and sure enough, along comes a very, very, very elderly Muntz who seems a tad...""touched"". This sets off some very hair-raising adventures and you'll just need to tune it to see what happens next.Technically speaking, this film was incredible and shows that the same old software is NOT being used but a newer generation with greater clarity and richness. I loved how through the course of the film, for instance, Carl's beard stubble starts to slowly grow in as well as the lovely shading and colors. While I loved RATATOUILLE and WALL-E for their animation, this looked a lot better--plus came in 3-D. I just saw Dreamworks' latest film the week before (MONSTERS VS. ALIENS) and frankly UP looked immensely better--there was just no comparison.As for the story, it was highly imaginative and strange--in a good way. I can only think of one other film that is like UP at all, and that is the wonderful French live action film, LE PAPILLON. It, too, is about an elderly single man who has an adorable child dumped in his lap and like UP, by the end of the film the old man has essentially been adopted by the kid. Both are rather predictable in that sense, but both also make it work due to brilliant writing, adorable kids and plot elements that are very unique and magical. Heck, in UP, the many dogs in the film can talk AND are excellent chefs--where have you ever seen that before?! Overall, it's a great film for almost all ages. I did notice in the theater that one kid (about 4) got very, very, very upset when the cute bird was captured--and he screamed and cried for some time. Keep this in mind if you do take young kids to see it--it may elicit come tears though there is no dirty language and the violence is mostly mild. For Pixar, this is among their best."
"The Walt Disney company released a series of somewhat ""groundbreaking"" animated films between 1937 and 1942 (""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"", ""Dumbo"" etc). Thereafter it degenerated into a purveyor of a formulaic, predictable and increasingly saccharine features. Over the decades it became nothing less than a cultural force, plucking stories from countries all over the world and then skewing them until they fit the ""Disney formula"". Eventually Disney seemed to have stopped making animated films altogether. Each new release was simply an addition to some already existent, homogeneous, ""Disney Land"". This is a land of fairy tales, princes and princesses, wicked stepmothers, dead parents, song and dance numbers, bumbling sidekicks, lots of anthropomorphic charm, the ubiquitous fear of separation and punishment, and some pretty despicable values relating to gender, monarchs and class. Eventually it got to the point where it didn't matter what Disney's films were about. All that mattered were that they conformed to the rules of ""Disney Land"". The stories, the characters, the customer expectations, the brand awareness, all coalesced to form a kind of bland corporate mission statement.Gradually the company began to shamelessly use its commitment to ""wholesome"" entertainment to market an endless array of toys, gadgets and clothes to children. It all seemed quite innocuous, but beneath Disney's self-proclaimed role as an icon of culture, lies a powerful educational apparatus that provides ideologically loaded fantasies for children and adults alike. Fantasy, for Disney, has no basis in reality, no sense of real conflicts, struggles, motivations or social relations. Instead, ""fantasy"" becomes a marketing device, a form of hype rooted solely in the logic of self-interest and buying. In the early 1990s, Disney received praise for films like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty and The Beast"". The studio had re-found its form, some said. By the time Pixar Studios had established itself as a brand in the late 90s, however, Disney had once again lost its cool factor. Burnt by poor box-office returns, the company started making sequels to its more popular animations and began releasing them solely on DVD or TV. Much later they'd begin gobbling up outside mega-franchises (Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars etc).Pixar's evolution very much mirrors Disney's. After a string of somewhat revolutionary films, and Brad Bird's two fairly personal features, Pixar has begun a slow spiral into mediocrity, ""Cars"", ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"" representing the company on a downward slope.""Up"" is about an elderly man and young boy who travel to South America and have a series of adventures. It's a consistently funny film, but virtually every character here is contrived and understood entirely in one dimensional terms. An old man lost his wife, a wife lost her child, a young boy lost his father, a talking dog is bullied by other dogs, a giant bird is separated from its offspring...every single character seems cynically designed or calibrated to quickly illicit unearned sentiment. Pixar's last film, ""WALL-E"", was no different, death (there are about 4 death scenes in that film), loneliness and loss rolled out like Pavlovian commands. See, ""WALL-E"" is dead, why not shed a tear? See, the old man lost his wife, why not weep? Of course Pixar's films have always been sentimental, but they were sentimental in subtler or original ways. Think the smile which ends ""Monster's Inc"", the food critic's flashback at the end of ""Rattatoille"" or the brief shot of unhatched eggs in ""Finding Nemo"".Ignoring Pixar's emotional regression, its plots have also become increasingly generic. ""Up"" in particular feels like a cocktail of bits and pieces plucked from ""Ice Age 3"", ""The House of Small Cubes"", ""The Red Balloon"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""King Kong"" etc. For a film which features an airship called ""The Spirit of Adventure"", the film is strangely cowardly, content to trade in stock characters and lazy chase scenes. Elsewhere the film champions adventure with one hand whilst exalting the return to Norman Rockwellesque normalcy; everyday life, we learn, is adventure enough. And those who go off on mighty exhibitions go insane anyway. This is very much the Pixar formula. Pixar's characters live in a small world, discover a bigger world outside of their familiar surroundings, and then retreat quickly back to the box. Beyond all this, ""Up"" is Pixar's attempt to outright mimic Hayao Miyazaki (the director of ""Up"" directed the English voice dubs of Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle"", another film with old people in a moving house). Pixar/Disney chief John Lasseter has often cited Miyazaki as a key influence on Pixar, but Miyazaki's films have a subtlety and sense of auteurism that these latest Pixar offerings lack. Observe, for example, the gorgeous flying scenes in ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Nausica"", ""Castle In the Sky"" and ""Porcco Rosso"". In comparison, the ""flying"" scenes in ""Up"" are strangely inert. While previous Pixar films have exploited space to great effect, ""Up"" is awash with flat compositions and ordinary camera work.Still, the film has some good moments, most of them occurring in ""Up's"" first half. Here we're treated to several clever visuals, jokes and powerful montages, some of which seem cribbed from Kunio Kato's ""The House of Small Cubes"" and Michael Apted's ""Up"", the latter a noteworthy documentary series which chronicles the lives of several human beings, from cradle to grave. It's all very sad.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing. See ""From Up on Poppy Hill"", ""The Girl who Leapt through Time"" and ""The King of Pigs""."
"Pixar has its first truly Disney project. It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to ""read"" the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual. I think that may have also to do with Disney strategies for dealing with technology threats.The child here is Asian. That's also a market driven decision.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"The boy Carl Fredrickson is a dreamer that idolizes the adventurer Charles Munts. When he meets the girl Ellie, who also worships Munts, they become close friends. However Charles Munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of Paradise Falls, and he travels in his blimp to South America to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. Carl and Ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to Paradise Falls and build a house there. Many years later, Ellie dies and the lonely Carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. When Carls hits one worker that damaged his box-mail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. However, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to Paradise Falls. While floating, he finds that the boy Russell, who is in the Wilderness Explorer Training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. They travel together to South America where Russell finds a weird bird that he names Kevin and the talking dog Doug. Then they meet the insane villain Charles Munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch Kevin with his talking dogs. But Carl and Russell decide to protect Kevin and they have the adventure of their lives. ""Up"" is a surrealistic adventure full of sentiments, where the heroes are an old widower and an annoying fat boy. The first point that impresses is how touching this story is with the dramatic situation of the elder Carl after losing his beloved Ellie, lonely and forgotten by the world that is changing. I slightly recalled the situation of Walt Kowalski, performed by Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"". The annoying Russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with Kevin and the talking dog Doug. There are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. Further, it is also impressive how Disney and Pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like ""Wall-e"" or ""The Incredibles"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Up – Altas Aventuras"" (""Up – High Adventures"")"
"I own every Pixar film on DVD but I have to say that UP may be the first one I pass on. I was very excited about seeing the film today after reading several good reviews. I think now that perhaps some reviewers out there are letting the Pixar reputation get to them. I can't believe ANYONE would say this is one of the best films of the year. Films like MONSTERS, INC, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E and TOY STORY deserved accolades like that but UP doesn't have the heart those classics did. The film is at its best early on when the characters aren't talking much. We see a montage of the lead character's life as a young Carl meets an exuberant girl named Ellie. We see them marry, live a life together, experience the highs and lows of life and finally, we see Carl loose his beloved Ellie and become a widower living alone in the house that always was their home. This sequence is moving and made me think that Pixar was about to strike another home run. However, at this point the characters start talking more and the story starts to get a bit...much. Carl decides to tie a bunch of helium balloons to his house in order to fly the house off to South America on the adventure he and Ellie were never able to complete together. He unwillingly takes along a young boy scout stand-in (Russell) who ends up on Carl's porch when the house takes off. Russell is determined to earn the patch for helping the elderly required by his troop in order to graduate to senior status. The balloon premise is a bit far-fetched but since it's an animated film, you go with it. However, once in South America, things get progressively weirder. Carl and Russell end up walking through the jungle and mountains with the house strapped to them, floating above. I think I knew the film was NOT going to be the usual classic I was used to from Pixar when they come across a bunch of talking dogs. It seems Pixar, whose done films about animals who can talk and done films just about humans, wanted to mix the two so they write into the story these dogs with collars that allow us to hear their thoughts. The dogs belong to an old adventurer living in the area who is determined to capture a big, ostrich-like bird to prove he's not the fake the world judge him to be decades ago when he claimed the bird existed. The adventurer has hundreds of dogs and not only do they search the jungles for the elusive bird, they also cook for their master, serve meals AND fly planes. Very weird. I think if you're going to make a film about smart, talking animals - make a film about smart talking animals (FINDING NEMO) and if you're going to do a film about humans, do one like THE INCREDIBLES about humans. In UP Pixar tries to mix the two and it just doesn't work. The ONE character who I thought had the most heart and was most interesting, was Kevin, the big bird who doesn't talk, seems devoted to her young and takes an instant liking to the human boy who probably reminds her of her babies. I heard kids in the audience more than once asking what was going on because they couldn't quite understand the story. I suspect UP will not be one of those films kids will watch over and over again like they do with the other Pixar classics. Pixar has some incredibly talented people but in UP I think they spent too much time on ""cool"" ideas and not as much time on developing the story and characters into something we could care about and believe in."
"Up is a funny adventure with very well rendered and well animated 3D images. It delivers a message that we, irrespective of age, should never forget about dreams and are able to lead meaningful lives. It also sheds some light on the importance of letting go.However, some ideas are underdeveloped and puzzling. First, the relationship between the old man Carl and the kid Russell is not well-developed enough. Judging from Carl's indifference to Russell's visit, I do not feel his desire to have children after Ellie's death. Simultaneously, Russell's admiration for Carl as his role model can be further developed so that their very good relationship in the last two scenes can be better prepared. For example, what skills has Russell learned from Carl who used to be an adventurer? After watching the film, some may find the ten-minute Carl-and-Ellie love story much more touching and memorable than the Carl-and-Russell adventure. Second, Carl, who relies on an electric chair to move downstairs and staggers along with a stick, suddenly becomes so strong that he can even climb the ladder with his feet hanging in the air, which does not make any sense even in the created world. Third, it is too easy for them to ""float"" to Paradise Falls, a mysterious place, without scenes showing Carl's prior knowledge on aviation or science, which not only makes the plot contrived, but also the first-15-mintue adventure less exciting. Fourth, why and how does the bad guy invent a device helping his dogs talk with different languages? Fifth, the bad guy should be much older than Carl and I wonder why he is still alive and looks even younger than Carl. Sixth, why does the dog, a loyal animal, betray the explorer, even when he has the upper hand?On the whole, Up is interesting, visually stunning and suitable for kids to watch. However, the story and characters can be further developed. Wall-E, with robots who cannot speak, is more touching, while Bolt, a Disney animation, is funnier than this one with hundreds of dogs. Until now, my favorite Pixar film is still Finding Nemo. Toy Story 2 and Wall-E rank the second and the third respectively. The rest of my top five are The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Up, despite using two ordinary human beings as the main characters, lets me DOWN."
"Coming off last year's hit Wall-E, Pixar attempts to sweep the hearts (and pockets) of moviegoers with Up. I had the privilege of seeing the film in Philadelphia two weeks before its release. Since Wall-E is in my personal top ten, I couldn't contain my excitement for the excitement Pixar had in store. But I was a bit worried that the premise of a man and his flying home couldn't translate into a feature. So is Up a worthy addition to Pixar's critically acclaimed catalogue?Well, just take a wild guess.Up revolves around 78 year old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, who has kept adventure alongside his childhood love Ellie. Meeting as pipsqueaks, the pair shared a lust for escapism and eventually married. Together they had this fantasy of going to Paradise Falls, an elusive world in South America where many wonders lay. But through a somber montage, we see things fall apart and pass away, leaving Carl alone in the house the two rebuilt through their lives.I should mention that Up has many sad (yet endearing) moments, for Carl deals with emotional loss while trying to rekindle his flame of adventure. After the aforementioned montage, one audience member burst into audible tears; I admittedly had to fight some back as well. When you see Carl wishing to be alone and personifying Ellie through their home, you can't help but feel (insert sad adjective).But alas! This *is* a Pixar film, after all. As Carl begins his journey through the skies, we're soon treated to blissful wonder, pure excitement, cunning suspense, and, of course, laughable humor. Pixar is the master of manipulating emotions, and a roller-coaster's worth is packed into 96 minutes.While resting in his buoyant home, Carl receives an unwelcomed addition to his adventure: 8 year old Russell, a Wilderness Explorer (i.e. Boy Scout) who helps Carl for an aiding the elderly merit badge. I originally thought the chipper chubbster would be annoying, catering mainly to the younger audience. However, Russell provides comical relief and has surprising emotional depth.As the characters' journey continues, we discover the pair is more alike than the 70 year difference would suggest. Along their way we meet a rare (and hungry) bird with a sense of humor, dogs who can talk, and many other surprises that I won't spoil. I honestly wasn't bored at all; even during the slower parts Pixar gives us much to admire.Unsurprisingly, Up looks AMAZING. While I didn't see it in 3-D, the 2-D version has plenty to marvel at. Instead of going for realism a la Wall-E, Up tries a more stylized look a la The Incrediblesand succeeds marvelously. I love Carl's squarish head, the vibrant colors, the miniscule details, everything. As a technology junkie, wondering about the programming and rendering used to make the film made my head spin. Things like the scripted physics behind Carl's balloons or the global light reflecting off Russell's chocolate bar were enough to give me a nerdgasm.The sound is fantastic as well. Again, Pixar gives us a great original theme which is mostly played on piano. It's sparse in emotional parts, loud and boisterous in action scenes. Edward Asner does an exceptional job voicing Mr. Fredricksen. All the technical aspects are what we've come to expect from Pixarwhich basically means they're perfect.However, I don't think Up is perfect overall. Granted, this is a film about a man who attaches balloons to his house and flies away, but there were moments that made me question certain choices or actions despite Up's fantastical setting. Furthermore, the central villain was a bit weak (not on a moral scale, though) and quickly came into play with little buildup. Though these seem a bit nitpicky, I was brought of the film at a few points and questioned certain things after the movie finished.Yet these complaints aren't deterring me from jumping on line and putting on 3-D glasses when Up is released. While it's no Wall-E in my book, Up is a film that will take your emotions up, up, and away. It's about loss, love, and realizing the destination isn't what necessarily matters; the adventure getting there is sometimes the most important thing. So take a seat beside me when Up is releasedbut could you get me some tissues this time? Oh, and while you're over there, you might as well grab that Oscar too.9.2 / 10, rounded up for Pixar's hard work through 10 films"
"It was a good movie, but not great. The beginning sequence was well-done, tender, and sweet, but it was not quite as emotionally affecting as I expected. I would have liked to see a couple more scenes of Carl and Ellie interacting with dialog because the scenes with them as kids didn't quite cut it for me...I liked how it set up Carl's instantaneous love for Ellie, foreshadowing the endurance of his love for her, but her character came off as unique (which was good) but also kind of annoying. If we got to see a little more of her character and dynamic with Carl, maybe a scene of her showing some love for him, I think the following music-only sequence and the whole movie would have been more emotionally compelling.Anyway, Carl as a character was a good protagonist, not the stereotypical, grumpy old man one might expect but instead a quiet, relatable human being. Russel, on the other hand, wasn't the best counterpart for Carl; he had some good moments, but was overall pretty typical and annoying at parts.And while I liked Kevin and Dug, I didn't care for their introduction and their plots. The fact that a giant bird, a pack of talking dogs, and a crazy old man comprise a large part of the story doesn't sit well with me, especially since the movie at first seemed to be rooted in realism (a balloon-propelled house isn't entirely realistic, of course, but it is not cartoonish like the aforementioned elements are).I would have overall preferred if the movie kept a sense of realism to it; there are plenty of ways to have adventures without all that hyper-cartoonish stuff. Even Muntz was a bit cartoonish for such a movie. However, while I would have liked the movie better without these unrealistic plots, they ended up working pretty well once the real point of them as a new adventure for Carl--an adventure to bring him and Russel together in a strong way and for a common good--was more firmly established and explored. However, this purpose still could have been accomplished in a less cartoonish way.As for humor, I didn't find many of the jokes to be funny. Maybe a couple were, but overall, it was kind of weak on humor. Several gags were predictable, and even those that were decent weren't great. I also think the writers thought Russel was a lot funnier than he actually was. And as for the emotion, there were some lines and scenes that seemed forced (for example, Russel's stories about his father), but there were other scenes that got the emotion just right; it worked best when it was understated and subtle.My favorite scene in the movie was when Carl looked through Ellie's ""Adventure Book"" and saw the photos of their enduring marriage inside with the final note of ""Thanks for the adventure. Now have a new one!"" A very simple yet powerful scene, in my opinion. And while I found the ending to be very predictable and the scene with the badge lacked the emotional impact it wanted to have, I did like the final scene of Carl and Russel eating ice cream and counting cars (unfortunately, it was the first time I felt a real bond between the characters.) Anyway, the end credits were really great too, very nicely summing up the whole message of the film...one of my favorite parts of the whole movie, actually. And this message of everyday life being an adventure when spent with someone you love was really nice, one of the best things about the movie.Technically speaking, the visuals were pretty great. I saw it in 3D, and it utilized the 3D well without overdoing it. The only thing that bothered me a little was that parts of Carl looked strange...his ears and hands mainly. But overall, really nice-looking movie. Oh, and the music (particularly the old-fashioned piano music) was awesome.In précis, probably worthy of a B/B-. Tentative grade, but there it is. Didn't reach the heights of emotion and beauty of ""Wall-E""; didn't as successfully accomplish the feeling of friendship and fun like ""Toy Story"" did, but still a fairly solid Pixar film."
"Am I the only one who thinks this movie is overrated? I was so excited when I saw the 9.2/10 rating late Friday night and couldn't wait to see it the next morning. I told my daughter we were going to see a very good movie on the way to the theater. My expectation was so high and I had been waiting for those good things coming to me throughout the whole movie, then found out there was nothing, no excitement nor surprise in this movie at all! Right now, I cannot recall a single thing which I think is special in this movie. A very so-so movie with a very typical Hollywood ending. There should be better story tellers out there. There should be a better movie deserves such high rating. Even my 7-year old daughter thought this movie was just OK. Very disappointed!"
"The negative reviews for this are horrible. The story was not too sad. It was like life is for old people. Their spouse dies, and they live by themselves. That, however, did not happen to Carl Fredrickson. He meets a lively adventurous little boy, and has a fantastic, exciting, and yes perilous adventure in the place of his childhood dreams. This adventure is in the loving memory of his wife, and although he starts out thinking the little boy is an annoyance, they become almost family by the end of the story. This is not a sad story. It is about a lonely old man, and a boy from a broken family making an unlikely and meaningful friendship. If anyone, says this story is too sad, I point to the ending. Was it sad? No. People compare this to the masterpiece of Wall-E which I think was equally if not more sad. Earth is an inhospitable wasteland, mankind turns into lazy useless blobs. Only at the end of that story is it happy and hopeful, which is the same for UP. UP is an UPlifting masterpiece about hope, friendship, adventure, and love."
"Once again, I shouldn't have trusted that preview, or it might have been that the short before ""Up"" was so wonderful, or was it that the mostly silent introduction to our main character was nothing short of glorious... somewhere, though, this film lost its ability to touch in the way other Pixar and animated features have done in the past.""Up"" is supposedly about achieving our dreams, discovering who we really are, learning to adapt to the changes life brings to us, and so many other themes that it is a wonder we even recognize them, as the film changes from an intimate portrayal of two lonely people to a rather hectic adventure that barely rises above average.The animation is, of course, superb, and the vocal work by all the people involved is first-rate. Problems arise when we notice than other than the amazing prologue, most of the good stuff has already been show in the preview. The other sections don't quite muster enough emotional power to make us care. For instance, the vistas aren't impressive, the set action pieces near the end don't carry much wallop, and it's hard to have a movie that lacks. The film just feels like some non-threatening film that is paying tribute to movies that had originality and the right tone. I couldn't help wondering what people like Spielberg and Zemeckis could have done with this movie, and the echoes of ""Wall-e"" kept haunting me, as I remembered the lyricism of that movie that made us remember what it is like to be human in the middle of all these choking technology. ""Up"" doesn't quite take you up for the ride, or make you feel ""up"". There is no cathartic moment, no real payoff, and the best moments are the sentimental moments when pictures of their loving relationship is on the screen.Marketing can do wonders, and this will be a huge moneymaker. Hopefully it will only receive the credit it really deserves, and audiences will be wiser so next, we enjoy something beyond a small, sweet film that couldn't quite give us what we expected."
"It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist—on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, ""Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.When we finally meet up with the long lost ""Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now onand that is up!"
"I'm a big fan of pixar movies, I think finding nemo, ratatouille and Wall-E (though to be fair I didn't like Wall-e either the first time I saw it) are some of the best examples of narrative storytelling in the last 20 years. Simply put, the Pixar clan know how to tell stories.That's why I was so surprised when I saw up. Now, maybe my expectations are too high, but I found it to be one of the weaker Pixar efforts. And here's a few reasons why.1. It draws on associated emotion, not real emotion. Much of the sadness in the film (and this is a sad - not happy movie) isn't earned. It comes from referencing other films and our own associations - specifically at the beginning. The opening montage goes by so quickly, as a scrap book, that it falls upon cliché to create the emotion. Granted, for many people this will work, because to be honest, there's something affecting about seeing cartoons go through ""serious"" emotions. Yet, these scenes lack the depth of having our characters go through real actions and real feelings. Things happen, the characters don't do anything - they let things happen to them. (and example is that Russel's (spoiler) parents are divorced. This scene is handled in a clichéd and associated way. So and so's not my mom! Heard that one before...) If you enjoyed the opening montage, watch Mr. Holland's opus - that movie does this same thing better.2. This movie isn't funny. All of the best jokes are used in the trailers/commercials. Much of the comedy is played too subtly (not subtle, but too subtle) and passed over too quickly. There's never a clear moment of what the movie is trying to make us feel at any given time - which brings me to 3. Tone. Is this a comedy, is it a melodrama? The movie doesn't really know what it is or is trying to say. It's inconsistencies constantly set up a new series of expectations which are never followed through on. It's serious...I'm thinking it's going to ... oh wait, a joke...wait...4. The narrative. The movie takes about 2 acts to find itself as a movie. Carl meanders though the film trying to take his South America. He wants to put his house down, and every 2 minutes a new complication arrives. Then, in the third act, he battles the old and now evil (how old is this guy supposed to be if Carl is 78?) Charles Muntz. He comes to defend russel and dug, and the bird. He finds a purpose - the movie finds itself as a movie! Finally...but by then we've spent 2 acts trying to get into another story completely.4A. there are a lot of clever storytelling devices, there is a good story here. It's a matter of the storytelling and dramatic devices the filmmakers use to elucidate that the story that are weak.5. The characters. Between Carl and Russel (shout out to the Asian community) we have a weak set of characters. The most interesting character, Ellie, dies. Her passive husband is left - the into to him shows how awesome she is. What did she see in him anyway? what did he do? Russel is kind of an idiot spaz. why should I root for someone who's so incompetent? If Pixar can animate characters with big heads and big eyes, everyone will think it's cute. Great date movies, great for kids, and hipsters. The overall storytelling I felt was pretty weak in UP. It felt like it was rushed off without knowing precisely where it was going - which is a joy to watch in the other pixar movies. Brad Bird and Andrew Stanton make you feel like you're in the hands of a master who is taking good care you - who is guiding you and surprising you, but never doing something you're not enjoying. Up is very muddled film-making. It's not horrible, but it's much weaker than the other films.cheers."
"What I like about Pixar: they generally cover each of these levels: 1) the setting 2) the story, 3) the characters, 4) drama, 5) humor, 6) visuals. In the case of Up, the humor was not at all on par with previous Pixar releases. But the biggest problem was with the setting of the story, i.e. the world they create. In Monsters, Inc they could invent anything, because it was a fictitious world. In Toy Story, the toys could do anything, but the humans were generally bound to the same physical laws as the rest of us. That's where Up makes a gigantic misstep. The main character is rendered very realistically, visually, but does the impossible for an elderly arthritic at every turn (running pulling a house... excuse me?). Where did the talking dog collars come from? The villain is portrayed as a realistic human, but it makes no sense that he might (living in the rain forest, alone) invent a talking dog collar. He's an explorer, not an engineer. This was clearly just something Pixar pulled out of their ""funny ideas to stick in a movie someday"" jar. They should have looked to see if it fit, first.There were some moving scenes, stunningly rendered, but as a cohesive long feature it fails."
"I just want to say that although I thoroughly enjoyed this film in many respects, it is not for children. It isn't as though they may not have fun watching it, as the visual effects are quite stunning, or they might not get a giggle or two from a few scenes, it's just that in order to fully appreciate the film you must have been in love at some point in your life...or at least comprehend love to the fullest extent.I would categorize this movie as a romantic comedy/action thriller for adults had it NOT been an animated film. As you may have heard it is nothing from what you would expect in the commercial previews. However, it is pleasantly unexpected. Had I known a thorough synopsis through the commercials, as some films seem to give everything away in a 30 second preview, I don't think I would have enjoyed the film as much.The movie touched my heart and as one reviewer said ""I began crying in within the first five minutes of the movie, and I'm not much of a crier."" Well, I certainly concur.This is a great movie for lovers, perhaps those going through a tough time in a relationship, or newlyweds. For children, however, they will most likely utter the words that my niece did, ""It's not funny."" If you have children that are easily entertained, patient, and can sit still through nearly any movie, take them along to watch with your significant other, if you can. Otherwise go with your partner, a close friend, or even yourself. I promise you'll be brought to tears, but they'll soon be wiped away as scenes become more comedic.Enjoy!"
"Yet another movie of pixar with a nice concept but failed to capitalize it...it was surprising that there was not one funny scene in the movie to which i could laugh.It is very disappointing that after a brilliant movie like wall-e with a brilliant concept and perfect execution pixar gave us UP which disappointed me very much...the movie is good enough to watch but this is not what i expect from pixar..this is not anyone expects from pixar!!!overall i am not satisfied with the movie and i don't think it is worth an 8 or a 9.this movie is overrated and i recommend everyone who loves pixar and loves their movies like wall-e,toy story,monsters inc. etc...to avoid this movie!!!"
"UP is not what I expected, and that is not good. The production values were excellent and the characters even seem to be well developed. However, when the film was about 2/3 finished I totally lost interest. So did my grandson who I took along to see it! (I allow for the fact that the film was not aimed at retired old men!) Others have pointed out the plot holes and nonsensical features (dogs talking through electronic collars? Why not just give them voices? After all, it is a cartoon!) But I think the thing that lost me was the total absence of purpose. One reviewer philosophized that the movie teaches the importance of dedication to a task, even if it takes your whole life. Well, I suppose it suggests that, but the same point could have been presented with a much more interesting plot. I had thought my 5 year old grandson, at least, would enjoy another PIXAR popcorn-ball of fluff. Instead, I think he really only enjoyed the popcorn I bought for him."
"The sneak peeks and trailers to this movie did not particularly inspire me to go to this movie. It looked like it was a rambling movie that didn't really speak to the comic or action side to the viewer. A guy puts enough balloons together to lift a house off it's foundation: So WHAT??? He inadvertently picks up a scout as he flies away: Again... so WHAT?? Getting the point of a movie is a big reason to motivate people to go SEE a movie I would think. But this was a Pixar film, and I NEVER miss a Pixar film. So, in a moment of spontaneous motivation (and seeing that 2 out of three spawn were currently in house that morning), I popped some corn, my wife filled some water bottles, and we all piled into the Tan Mini-van and went down to the Metropolitan theater (where I felt confident I would not be met with a sour presentation of this film) to purchase tickets and view this movie.The last time I went to see an ""3D"" film was an iMax theater with sharks and fish. It was pretty cool, so I was happy to kid about how much the glasses added to the family appeal. We sat down and waded through the kiddie previews and trailers then came an announcement to put our 3D glasses on. The new Toy Story and Ice Age (both up to their 3rd sequel) previews were run. Sorry, when you get to a third sequel that wasn't originally written as a trilogy I can't get excited. The Disney lead-on filled the screen and away we went.Within the first 10 minutes I was angrily batting moisture from my cheeks. I was shocked. Pixar emptied the climax of the plot first off, but what an opening sequence of events! Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around a core of love and a promise. Remember those ""Cross your heart"" promises? Well, there you have it. The rest is a strange adventure with some odd sub-plots that seem thrown in to keep the kiddies focused. Both colorful and deep, the only real question one keeps throughout the movie is whether the promise will be fulfilled or not.My wife and I watched through the ending credits (hoping for a surprise tag somewhere. Sadly, no) and saw Brad Birds name come up in the conceptualization of this film, and granted some of his influence if felt. The primary animators are quite diversified and well established, some even old enough to be your father or grandfather. As I IMDb'd some of the talent, I was impressed... and as for Ed Asner playing the primary role: I thought he had died years ago!!! But he's alive, and a great talent for the part. Pete Docter who has been in the Pixar pen since the first Toy Story does an admirable job of making this one and a half hour film both entertaining and thoughtful. There are chases, there are technological malfunctions, there are obsessions, there are fanatics and there are devouts and totally absurd sequences. This movie is no less a study of society than ornithology is a study of birds. Its amazing.And all through it you get to see how generations meet and interact on a very honest level. I am not young, but I am not old. Each generation will find something totally involving in this film. From an artists point of view the artwork and color are spot on; from a comedy point of view it is not overwhelming; from the heart... well, it's profound.The audience clapped after it was over. During the viewing, there was a nominal level of noise from the ""too young to even enjoy Dr Suess"" generation but it wasn't distracting. This film is for kids; Well, not just kids... for kids, adolescents, early adulthood, young parents, old parents, grandparents... its for everyone. Highly recommended. Well done, Pixar, well done."
"When I walked into the theater last night for the 9:15 showing of Up I had high expectations. I didn't go in with a half-hearted interest or mild confidence; I was expecting to see something amazing and I wasn't let down. ""Up"" flies as high as the House that becomes the premise of the film.I admit I was a bit distracted when the movie began; either no one knew the movie was starting or no one cared because they were being VERY loud. But as the movie played on the noise died down and I found myself charmed by an opening sequence that is so emotional that you'd hardly believe you were watching a children's movie. In fact, three fourths of the way through the sequence a younger woman sitting in front of me declared to her friends ""This movie is sad!"" in a voice that indicated she had not been expecting it. That being said this movie is still definitely suitable for little children and although I wouldn't go as far as to call it a children's film (I think pixar is beyond that) it has, as always when it comes to pixar, no course jokes or crude humor.As the movie progressed past the opening sequence, I almost expected to be let down by what came next; I wasn't. After a touching opening sequence that told the tale of his life, the character of Carl Fredrickson continues to be developed with such care that you can't help but feel sorry for him when the men Nursing Home comes to hall him away; even if he is a bit grumpy.Since I don't have time to go through the movie section by section (and you probably wouldn't have time to read it even if I did) I'll continue this review by highlighting my favorite bits and criticizing what little there is to criticize.The scene in which the house is sweeping through the clouds as a storm rages around is truly incredible; the action is actually intense and you don't feel like your watching a happy fairytale in which the characters would never get hurt or die. In general, the action was that way throughout the film. There was one point somewhere between the touching storytelling, the witty script and the epic action that I literally forgot the movie was animated and that has arguably never happened to me before.The biggest downfall of the movie, in my opinion, were the evil talking dogs. I found Dug to be the only talking dog that really came across effectively; the other ""evil"" dogs had little to no character development, were not memorable at all and were not threatening in the slightest. When they climbed into airplanes to shoot at Russell I found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief; dog's flying airplanes? This small downfall, however, is not near enough to ruin the movie in any way.Another slight downfall (and I'm not sure if I'd really call this a downfall) is that I would have liked a bit more of a sense of wonder and discovery when Carl and Russell first arrived at Paradise Falls; perhaps they could have discovered a few interesting creatures (besides Kevin) or strange plants. Ultimately I don't think they would have had time for this which is probably why it wasn't there but it would have been nice addition.As you can probably already tell, my overall opinion on this film is VERY positive; although a bit more of time would have made the film a bit more interesting and well-rounded, in the end, it is not needed and the film still comes across as charming and even epic without it."
"""UP"" is one of the most wonderful animated feature from Pixar, which included all of the emotions of sadness, heartfelt, funny, whimsical and adventurous which can bring you into tears. It begins with a romance as sweet and lovely as any I can recall in feature animation. Two children named Carl and Ellie meet and discover. They share the same dream of someday being explorers and following the entire marriage life, it began with the love from first sight to widowhood and continues with the amazing skyward journey to Paradise Falls. Finally, I love how this film really touching my heart and I cried every time I watch this movie. It's such a very deep emotional film that no one will ever miss."
"For starters, I would like to apologize for the summary description I gave this film (I couldn't resist the chance to use a pun). Now that I've said that, lets cut to the chase; Up is your average Pixar movie...and if you're not familiar enough with Pixar then you should be informed that the average Pixar movie has 1) excellent voice acting. 2)cutting edge animation. 3)great story and script. and 4) heart.In other words, Up is slam dunk of a family movie. The plot is about the misadventures and adventures of an old man named Carl Fredriechson and a tag along boy scout. But there's more! If you want to know the rest, then go see the movie.Like all Pixar movies, the voice cast is spot on. All of Up's characters are brought to life with well read lines, vocally emotional undertones, and an assortment of talents. Pixar's trademark CGI animation also breathes life into the characters, all of them are given convincing facial animations and gestures which could match any Hollywood A-lister's.All of the CGI (which is everything seen in the movie) is done beautifully. The scenery is breathtaking and the jungle sets sometimes look as if they were ripped from an issue of National Geographic. Pixar's signature animation is always cartoonish, yet photo-realistic and of course, ahead of their competition.What's also impressive about Pixar is that they never underestimate the power of story. Up's story is original enough (talking dogs and a house held afloat by balloons aren't even the half of it) but it isn't just about the physical conflict and events. It is really the story of an old man trying to find redemption in the twilight of his life by fulfilling an unrealized dream. Pixar has mastered the art of throwing tragedy and warmth into the same basket without becoming too heavy handed, and you can feel it in this movie. Up is also exciting and fun. The sense of adventure is palpable and the humor is charming. The script is also nicely written and clever. This movie is also very, very family friendly, despite its PG rating.The bottom line is that Up is beautiful, touching, humorous, charming and kid and parent friendly. It is just another grade A Pixar movie. Which means that unless your inner child is completely dead you should see it!"
"This movie is billed as ""the funniest movie of the summer"", with a PG rating for ""some peril and action"". It should be billed as ""the scariest movie of the summer for kids"", with a PG rating for ""a heck of a lot of peril and a thoroughly frightening and upsetting storyline and message"". It's the sort of animated movie I'd expect from Tim Burton, not Walt Disney and Pixar.Here's what the promos show you:* bright cheerful balloons lifting a house out of the gray yucky city* a funny, crotchety old man* a cute kid along for the ride* a cute talking dog* a cute goofy bird* a standard comical cartoon villainHere's what's actually in this movie:* an absolutely charming couple having their dreams shattered. Not to mention the wife being stricken ill and dying just as they have a shot at unshattering the dream (my 7-year-old son was in tears at this point, 15 minutes into the movie)* an elderly man sent to a retirement home against his will after being deemed a threat to the community because he conked someone on the head with his cane after they broke the mailbox he built with his beloved (now-deceased) wife* a kid whose stepmother tells him he is an annoyance to his father* a pack of snarling growling dogs realistically-rendered with glowing red eyes/collars chasing an unknown creature through a misty jungle (somewhat common in older Disney movies, but the scenes last much longer and are more intense than in the older movies)* a mean, nasty, paranoid, completely uncomical villain* the same dogs chasing people through a 3-D immersive landscape of cliffs and falling rocks* the cute lovable dog hero (who, btw, is cartoony) cowering in absolute terror before the pack of dogs (who are, as I said above, realistically rendered)* the elderly man's house being burned* the kid being abandoned by the elderly man* the kid tied to a chair on the open loading ramp of an airborne dirigible, slowly sliding down it toward his death (yes, there is a last-minute save)* the cute funny mother bird hero being forced away from her babies by the pack of dogs* and, finally, instead of the happy ending that we've come to expect from Disney/Pixar, when our heroes have saved the day and returned to normal life, there's the ultimate disappointment of all. The kid, you see, has been doing all of this to get his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge and become a Senior Wilderness explorer so that his Dad will come to the ceremony. Kid gets badge, kid gets ceremony, and Dad doesn't show up. Yes, that's right the final message of the movie is ""your Dad hates you""Watching the promos, would you expect any of this? Do ""funniest movie of the summer"" and ""some peril and action"" even hint at any of this? Do any of the reviews mention any of the stuff I just listed? No, they warn you that ""one character hits another one and draws some blood"" (a tiny little spot of blood on the mailbox-breaker's head), and ""a girl admits to tearing a page out of a library book"" (ooo, the rebel!) and ""a bird gets bitten in the leg"" (yup, a big garishly-colored, completely non-realistic-looking bird). You read that, and you see the Disney/Pixar logo, and you think ""OK, I don't mind that, and my kids can deal it.""Instead, I had one child clinging to my wife for most of the movie, and another crying and begging to leave halfway through. We stayed because we felt they needed to see the standard Disney/Pixar happy ending. See my last bullet point above to see what we got instead.Yes, there were funny moments. The talking collars that show exactly what the dogs are thinking are hilarious and extremely well done, and there was a subtle homage to the classic ""Dogs Playing Poker"" paintings that had me in stitches.But unlike other Disney and Pixar stuff, the scary and sad scenes were more frequent and much more compelling and overwhelming than the funny bits.I don't usually go on the warpath like this - I figure, if you like a movie, see it, and if you don't, don't. But I am so incensed at how wildly Disney, Pixar, and the media have completely and utterly misrepresented this movie as a light, airy jaunt in a floating house instead of a terror-filled action/adventure movie that happens to be animated that I just have to speak out."
"The kid screamed, cried a river, feared, worried, wanted to get out of there, wanted to quit the whole thing and go home. I am not talking about Russell, the kid character in the movie, I am talking about my 6 year old kid. It was his worst time ever in a movie theater. Certainly I regret taking him to see this film.SPOILERS START HERESadness (excesive in my opinion), dogs with ridiculous talking gadgets to save film time, an exaggerated villain (who being a hero world explorer becomes a raving-mad animal slaughterer in a split second), a cartoonesque rare bird taken from a Porky Pig episode that is neither funny nor tender and scared the hell out of my kid, a miraculously resistant hose, inconsistent time tables (if Muntz was a grown up when Carl was a kid, how old is he when Carl is 78 years old?), graphic violence and a common place kid of divorced parents to fix the tearful ending.I certainly do not agree with all these ""best Pixar film ever"" reviews. The story is not solid, everything is excessively explained for an adult film and extremely violent for a children's.It seems that some executive had the idea of a flying house and nobody knew what to do with that.Yes, the graphics are great, but then again, Pixar used to do more than that."
"I watched this film a lot later than it came out on DVD. Im glad i didn't go to the cinema to watch this.the first few minutes of the film were very well done. they didn't seem emotional at all in my view, but they made me root for the character and i wanted him to succeed. Possibly the scene that made me want to shout at the screen was the bit where the contractors came to take his house. the storm scene was again very well done. but as soon as they landed in south America, i was met with a wall of one-sided character development, weak storyline, and irrational behavior. maybe if there were more scenes that the old man (i forget his name) had to bond with the two incredibly annoying creatures, i wouldn't be so harsh with this review. but i cant understand at all why he would suddenly risk his life to save a stupid bird that, less than 10 minutes ago, he told to sod off. the dog got on my nerves too. by the end i found no reason why anyone would want to rescue that bloody thing, and i wished it had fallen onto some rocks or something.the villain was irrational. he seems to undergo an impossible change of character - either he was a schizo, or the script wasn't written very well. one minute he wants to find the bird alongside the old man, next he sees the bird and wants to kill them both instead of asking nicely for it. this sort of insane colour bambardment continues throughout the film, and we get loads of threads in the story which are left untied. a good script is one where every move made by the characters is one that you know fits the character well, or one that you would be able to transpose onto a real person. in UP, the only rational decsion made is the marriage of that woman to that man.(i forget their names, you see.) everything else said or done is so implausible that the rest of the film dies. I'm sorry, but here are some examples. the bird is an annoyance to everyone - the dog, the old man, the boy - but everybody loves it. its another example of the annoying thing that everyone likes in Disney films. the old man spends less than a day with that boy and suddenly they are like father and son. the villain guy has no reason to chase the people with dogs. he could simply ask for the bird. but he instead embarks on this needless token battle which ends in his death.nobody sees the stupidity of the decisions made in the film, and i really hope that this film does not make it into the top 250 - or top 100000 for that matter. this was probably the only pixar film which sunk to the depths of chaep Disney drivel. i despair."
"Perhaps the best part of this movie was the beginning, but after that, it was really more like a long kid's cartoon. Sorry - I know lots of people (including critics) love this film, but I'm just calling it as I saw it. There were no earth-shattering scenes that I'm replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that I will quote one day, nor mind-blowing visuals that I will tantalizingly dwell on. For me, it was just a good movie, nothing more.A lot of this movie is like Wall-E. There's a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. If you like that sort thing, great! The action-oriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great.A real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. A mysterious exotic 'creature' or something would have been far engaging. Instead, we get an ungainly, multi-colored bird that's kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoa-puffs cereal bird.3D: This movie was pretty tame in its use of 3D. It's there, but after 10 minutes, I'll it kind of fades to the background. Just a day later, I remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3D one.Soooo ... what do I recommend? I recommend seeing it! Even though I give it a 6/10, I know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average movie-goer will like it is high.What I would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it. Think about best movies you have ever seen - remember them clearly, and then ask ... was this one of them ... really?"
"yes, this review contains tons of spoilers, so if you read it - you probably won't want to see the movie.. UP has been peddled to us by Pixar studio and many critics as Pixar's ""funniest cartoon ever"", well, some add ""arguably"" to this sentence, which did not make it any less misleading.. don't get me wrong, i love Pixar and all the masterpieces they gave us over the years, which only adds to my surprise and disappointment over UP - such a professional and famous studio either consciously joined other dishonest movie factories in an effort to advertise their product falsely, or for some unknown reason no one at Pixar understands what they created..and now - this is the movie in a nutshell (and a million spoilers, so you may want stop reading right here):1. boy meets girl, they both are mad about famous explorer and dream of traveling to some south American land ""lost in time"" discovered by this guy, who actually disappears from public view being ridiculed by scientists who do not believe the skeleton of an unknown bird he found is real.. well, boy marries girl..2. in 5 silent minutes narrated by the music Pixar geniuses show us the life of this cute couple, from happy marriage to the moment they discover she can't have kids (or was it a miscarriage you tried to show us in this happy funny movie, Pixar guys ?) to two of them getting old to her dying from cancer (or what was it that killed her, Pixar friends ?) and him being stuck in the same house, which is now surrounded on all sides by new high-rises, while some developers looking like men in black try to squeeze the poor old guy out of his house and his piece of land.. i'll be honest, the short story of their life ending with wife's' death brought me to tears.. and i was going to see a funny cartoon..also, as we're shown this couple spent all their life in the same house, and husband never achieved anything beyond the position of balloon vendor in a local park.. what the hell ? 3. old dude is visited by an overweight inapt boy scout who wants to help him in any way to earn ""help elderly"" badge..4. old man is fed up, he attacks one of the construction workers, court rules he has to vacate the house, and right when two indifferent dudes from assisted living place come to pick him up he fills up thousands of balloons he has from his job with gas and launches his whole house into aerial adventure.. let me also say that throughout the whole movie he constantly looks at the pictures of his deceased wife and talks to her, which is very painful to watch..5. Fat boy scout somehow jumps aboard the house, and is stuck there with old man...6. they arrive to south America by means of huge storm..7. miraculously they find themselves almost at the very spot old man dreamed reaching all his life.. they meet a weird talking dog (she usesspecial translating electronic collar) and a huge weird bird..8. they travel together trying to land the house at the designated water fall, while we find out that this dog is one of many ""talking dogs"" raised and put in servitude by the famous explorer, who is still, for like 60 years hiding with his huge blimp in a cave in the vicinity somewhere, trying to catch this rare bird, yes the very bird that old man and fat boy scout befriended.. old man meets explorer (who is apparently 150 years old at this point, but looks as ""young"" as old man), soon they figure out that Mr. explorer is cold-blooded killer who is ready to dispatch of anyone standing between him and the bird, and an ""indiana jones"" type sequence of events transpires before our eyes, during which the meanest talking dogs and Mr. evil explorer plunge to their deaths, old man looses the house, but comes in possession of the blimp and everything on it, as well as the army of remaining talking dogs..good adventure, terrific graphics, but...could this cartoon be any more sad ? and did i mention that poor fat boy scout lives with stepmother and abandoned by his real dad ? i don't know about you, but i wish there was a law that would let me sue a movie studio for false and misleading advertising..if i knew how depressing UP is - i'd never gone to see it..yes, there is ton of ""funny"" stuff in this movie, the interaction of old man and boy scout and talking dog and huge bird, and every character's graphics is funny and cartoonish, but none of this joyful ha-ha stuff manages to even remotely disguise the extremely sad plot lines..old man is heartbroken about his wife the entire movie, the whole balloon journey is about fulfilling her dream of getting to this south American place (why they never tried to get there in their 60 years together is beyond understanding, particularly given that they did not have any kids to look after (we were explained that all too well)), the boy scout is heartbroken about his dad leaving him, the bird gets injured by evil dogs (though recovers later), the famous explorer reveals himself as a homicidal maniac, and so forth...yes, as a story about the unlikely friendship, helping friends, fulfilling dreams and other crap like this - this cartoon is great..but as an ""arguably"" the funniest Pixar work it fails so miserably, so breathtakingly and profoundly that i am nothing but sorry i saw it..in no way it is for kids, and adults should know how heartbreaking the whole thing is..Pixar, why ?"
"Some, and you know who you are if you're reading this, may come across the IMDb page for Pixar's Up (and no, it's not Up! with an exclamation point, as that belongs to the 1976 Russ Meyer X-rated flick), and turn your nose up at it as just another Disney and/or Pixar kids flick. ""An old man with balloons tied to his house flying around with an annoying kid, not enough ""art"" for my taste"" (or something similar to that if not as snobbish). I want to relay an example for you that may get you excited: this is for Pixar a riff on Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. You might remember that crazy little movie where Klaus Kinski, a dreamer obsessed with opera, decides he has to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle, so in order to accomplish this he has to drag his big freighter-ship across a mountain to the other side. It is a leap of faith, but we take it because it's led by a filmmaker with a compelling sense of telling a story with an equally compelling protagonist. Balloons tied to a house, ship across a mountain, not much difference if you ask me, just the degree of the ambition.But it's not enough to compare it to Herzog, or even really try to. Pixar's Up, directed by Pete Doctor, is original in its intent to make a serious adventure movie that starts off as something quite mature, makes it big leap to kids, and then straddles that line like that guy who crossed the twin towers on the tightrope in the 70s. Take your adjective, this is beautiful, audacious, heartbreaking, heartrending, sublime, hilarious, surreal, inventive film-making, and it doesn't talk down to any age group in its story of an old man, Carl Frederickson, who fulfills his and his late-wife's dream of having a house on a hilltop called Paradise Falls that their favorite explorer as kids flew to in South America. If you're a kid you'll not get any tasteless jokes (there's one poo joke that actually works since it's brief and, dare I say it, funny as hell), and it helps to get you prepared for some of the hardships that may come in life, like, well, the possibility of not having kids and losing your loved one in old age. Rare does it happen that you'll cry in the first ten minutes of a Disney family film anymore. Here's the rarity.Up is also in the tradition of wild fantasy, like a tale out of the Lost World mixed in with a tale out of Pixar's idols, Studio Ghibli. One could definitely see the kinds of characters like Carl, Russel and the hero-turned-villain explorer Charles Muntz in a Miyazaki film (as Ebert so thankfully noted in his review), but they also remain true to the Pixar tradition that's given them their distinction. They're never card-board cut-outs, and even when faced with certain plot elements reminiscent of Disney fare, such as with the big bird, ""Kevin"", in the jungle they have to help get back to her kids, or the (insane/perfect) comic relief of the dogs that talk with the collars around their necks, its dealt with the kind of love and care that should be given in solid storytelling. Nothing is too frivolous in Up, and there's an undercurrent of sadness to both Carl, for what he's lost and has to achieve without his late wife he's known since childhood, and for Russell lacking a father figure or real mother (this last part is handled really well, watch for ""Phyllis"" mentioned).Oh, and I forgot, it's animated in the usual tradition of Pixar fare: awesomely. Following on the heels of their arguable top-top masterpiece WALL-E, Up features the ordinary (inside a house, an old man) and the extraordinary (the birds, the dogs, the juxtaposition of a floating house with an airship, something else out of say Howl's Moving Castle) with delicacy and subtly while at the same time grandiosity and the vibrancy possible in the medium. I could go on and on, about how howlingly funny it is or how touching it is in the little moments. But make no mistake, Up is modern film art, even if it doesn't fit into your local art-house cinema. Take the (well-behaved/respectful) kids, take the old folks, take your rotten punk kid. It is what it is- squirrel! Good stuff."
"Being sparked by an idea is not enough. Not enough when you dream to make a full length motion picture and want your audience to relish and reminisce every frame conceived. I did have very high expectations of the movie ever since i read rave reviews from the Cannes fest, also counting the exciting preview screened before Terminator Salvation began. The balloons, the lift, the adventure appealed to me instantly, the lover that i am of 21 balloons. it's with this heightened expectation that i approached the movie and was disappointed by every attempt of Pixar's in creating a story out of an idea. That would be the most frustrating part of any writer's work when a grand idea has to be developed to reach it's end. Sadly this is where the writers lost it. They had a planned and riveting story until the old man (Carl Fredricksen) realizes it's never too late to get started on anything. The plaintive note of Carl's early life all played very well with the setting to escape on a long wished for adventure. Yes the story held me in it's sway UP until this point. This point was stretched so far as to include the 70 year old Carl confronting his childhood idol, Muntz ( who should be about 95+) and is seen walking with ease and in perfect health ( did the writers in their right mind think this made sense at all,), a senseless plot about capturing a bird that loves chocolates, which is by the way the central plot( not the balloon adventure that you thought the movie was about. Oh did i mention the plot also includes dogs that can communicate their thoughts in human language with the aid of a collar.Writers what were you thinking? You just robbed me off my precious two hours and another half in writing out this painful review. Why painful? I carried home a souvenir. A splitting headache"
"For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.So far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.The trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.Yet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz""). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, ""Ratatoille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through."
"I guess, there will not be too many people who'd agree with me. But that is what I really think. In general, I was really upset. I'll even say that I waisted my money and time, because I payed to get sad, while there is enough of terrible things in this world. I was going to see an adventure and comedy but I saw a blue story about unfulfilled dreams. If you remember a movie 'What dreams may come?', I have the same feelings after this one: this world is unfair. I'd say that this movie is good for kids - it will teach them some generally good characteristics. And movie wasn't funny...it was cute and nice...and heartbreaking . Someone can say, that it is a sign of a good quality movie, when it touches your heart. I agree with that, and sometimes it can be too much of touching. If it had less sad parts but with the same story it would be better."
"Do not take young children to see UP. The movie starts with a depressing montage of an young boy meeting, marrying, and then burying the love of his life. They grow old together, childless, after finding out that she is barren, and then the wife dies. That is how UP opens and it only gets worse from there. There is physical assault, the endangerment of a child, savage dogs, fire, more physical assault and death (again). There is nothing uplifting or redeeming about UP and most of the young children in the theatre had to be carried out crying, because sections of it are dark, menacing and terrifying. The parents I was with agreed that this had to be the product of a disturbed mind and castigated Disney for ever releasing such violent dark content. Nobody had any idea how UP got its rating, with all the violence and darkness. This movie can and probably will damage the Disney brand in terms of how much parents trust it in future. Not suitable for children and by no means is it an uplifting, funny or enjoyable film."
