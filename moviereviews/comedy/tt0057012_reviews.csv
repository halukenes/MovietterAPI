"I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr.Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"DR. STRANGELOVE.... is a satirical black comedy or rather an ironic approach to decisions and information in the Cold War madness. The smart choice is the mother of all wisdom. It is loosely based on Peter George's novel ""Red Alert"".A crazy American general has ordered, due a bizarre reason, a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. A bit absentminded captain has realized that a general has lost his mind. Meanwhile, a President meets with his top Pentagon advisors, including a passionate super-hawk general, who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism in general and Russians in particular. However, the Russians have an ""automatic"" response...This film loses all touch with the reality on the one side, and yet, it directly affects an image of a disturbed political reality on the other side. The irony stems from human stupidity, irresponsibility, suspicion and arrogance. Mr. Kubrick has created a satirical hopeless situation, through a conflict of mentality and a sense of patriotism, after which, a bizarre - moral winner rises. The highlight of satire is that world diplomacy rejects itself on multiple occasions.However, there is a lot of questions. Why give so much power in hands of a few people? One of them, I mean all, are mostly crazy. Why use energy resources to build nuclear weapons? Probably because we do not have better things to do. Is it wise to make fun of a defense system of the strongest force in the world? Of course it is, one day, we have to stop being afraid of each other.That's why this film is a satirical warning in an universal time, because we live in a time of a political satire with very serious consequences.I am thrilled with a fact that this film does not have a trace of cynicism. Of course, there is plenty of satire, sarcasm, irony, perhaps exaggerated caricature, but there is no cynicism. Mr. Kubrick, you're a genius! The characterization is excellent.Peter Sellers (Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove, the wheelchair-using nuclear war expert and former Nazi) is simply awesome as a kind of voice of reason, incompetence and insanity at the same time. It is a strange kind of patriot, savior and avenger.Sterling Hayden (Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper) is a paranoid ultra-nationalist, who shows his madness through a serious facial expression.George C. Scott (General Buck Turgidson) is the personification of chauvinism. He expresses his anger and paranoia of communism in a very comical way."
"Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is cited as one of the director's best films, and one of, if not the best satirical comedy in cinema history, and with very good reason.Dr. Strangelove exceeds exponentially in many ways, the three main being the direction, writing and the unforgettable performances from George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and of course, Peter Sellers. Kubrick's direction is perfect, the film is perfectly paced, no scene overstays it's welcome and the editing and camera angles do their jobs greatly at conveying a time of nuclear crisis but at the same time remaining darkly humorous. One of the more obvious factors of the film is that it is shot and presented in black and white which works perfectly with the film, the dark representing the terror of the situation and the white representing the comedic side of the film. Kubrick also manages to assist in the comedic side of the film, he achieved this through using 'rehearsal' takes and allowing Peter Sellers to improvise. The level of film making is exquisite, Kubrick uses mostly steady camera shots when in the War Room, and hand-held camera shots when inside the B-52 bomber, he also frames each image with perfection and creates incredible compositions. He never cuts too often or ever drastically changes the angle, thus never confusing the viewer and allowing the scenes to flow. The B- 52 models on real life footage backgrounds may look dated, but oddly enough it still works well with the overall tone of the film, in fact it could be argued that it even adds a small comedic aspect to the film.In my opinion, this film's writing was quite underrated, many people remember the genius unforgettable lines that were likely ad-libbed by Peter Sellers, but overall the film's dialogue and plot is incredibly well written. The plot goes that the general of an air force base goes mad and without-authority, commands a large number of B-52 bombers to attack their targets in Russia, and the men and President in the War Room, desperately attempt to prevent this from happening. This plot is outright brilliant and is executed brilliantly, there is no outright exposition in the dialogue, and any exposition there is, is not jarring or comes of as lazy at all. The film does an incredible job at creating an environment of sheer crisis, with George C. Scott's character explaining that there are very few options in resolving the matter, and the reveal of Russia's top secret 'Doomsday Machine' which adds an almost unbearable amount of tension to the film. The film reaches it's inevitable end of Nuclear Annihilation, after one of the B-52 bombers manages to hit one of it's targets, thus triggering the Doomsday Machine and ending all life on Earth. I found this ending not only to make sense, but also to fit perfectly into the film's tone, there is also a great comedic value to the end, with it coming so suddenly and playing classic music over the footage of many nuclear bombs detonating.Overall, I hope it is clear that I see this as simply one of the best comedies ever made, or even perhaps one of the best films ever made. The film is incredibly unique and although the more satirical points of the film may not be quite as relevant now, they are still hilarious to experience. The film holds up incredibly well even with it's clearly dated visual effects and somewhat dated humour, but Peter Seller's performance alone will allow for this film to be seen as one of the funniest satires ever made even long after the events the film is poking fun at have ended. And even if you don't find the film particularly funny, you can still be in awe of the genius film making and incredibly suspenseful plot."
"Spectacular and chilling to watch Dr. Strangelove in May 16, 2017. I'm not going to talk about prophecy not even coincidence. Art has a way to warn, express or simply entertain in a way that its relevance will always be renewed. That opening with George C Scott's secretary, in her underwear, answering the phone for her boss in the most professional tone imaginable, is a masterful way to introduce us to the normal absurdity we're about to embark on. Terry Southern's extraordinary script (sharing credit with Peter George and Stanley Kubrick himself) is a masterpiece of intention and execution. The film doesn't have a moment of emptiness nor a single cheap shot. Everything works with the irrational logic of tradition and set standards. How can something so serious and ultimately terrifying can be so funny. I think that's the definition of film art. I don't want to sound pompous but that's exactly how I feel. I've seen a 1966 movie by Stanley Kubrick in 2017 that's better, more relevant, ingenious and even revolutionary than anything we've seen in a long, long time. Peter Sellers, fantastic three times over (and he was also going to play the Slim Pickens part) George C Scott in one of the greatest comic performances ever put on film and Sterling Hayden in a frighteningly credible show of abuse of power, complete the pleasures of this remarkable film."
"What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!"
"Stanley Kubrick's first and only comedic masterpiece is still the finest ever made. I love everything in the movie: the brilliant acting, sensational script, flawless direction, and even those quirky visual effects. Not only was this film hilarious, it was a breakthrough for the entire film industry when first released. In addition to it's amazing satirical basis, the film also played a major role in how films were advertised and marketed... as if Peter Seller's performance wasn't enough! The sets were also very convincing and just plain great! So realistic in fact, that the FBI almost investigated how they got the B-52 Bomber replicated to near perfection!In the end, 'Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is the best comedy. It's also another milestone in film making and another reason to be astonished when looking at the work of Stanley Kubrick.An obvious perfect ***** / *****"
"This movie is possibly the best comedy ever made, only with one fact against it: it's not very ""comical"". Hilarious? Yes. Comical? Absolutely not. The horrors of the nuclear war caused by a simple mistake materialize before us, directed with skill by the late maestro, Kubrick.There are simply not enough words to describe Peter Sellers's BRILLIANT performance in three roles: A british officer, the U.S president and Dr. Strangelove. He is hilarious as the british officer, with his wonderful accent, gloomy and neurotic as the president and simply insane as Dr. Strangelove.Also note that this movie includes a performance by very young James Earl Jones, who we now all know as the voice behind Darth Vader.The ending scene is also a masterpiece."
"Stanley Kubrick's wickedly hilarious end-of-the-world black comedy gem about an impending nuclear war caused by human error straddles a fine line between being fiercely funny and genuinely chilling throughout: As evident by the gross behavior and arrogant attitudes of various high-ranking officials in positions of power that they are neither smart nor mature enough to properly handle, the greatest threat to mankind's safety isn't the existence of nuclear weapons; instead it's such all too real and unavoidable human foibles as pride, stupidity, and incompetence that we should all be more worried about.The savagely mocking script by Kubrick, Peter George, and Terry Southern pulls zero punches in its no-holds-barred satirizing of said foibles and offers numerous uproarious moments of inspired dark humor: The meek and ineffectual President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers in one of three bravura performances) informing the drunken Soviet premier over the phone about the nuclear strike, the hysterically loony speech made by unhinged paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (robustly played with snarly aplomb by Sterling Hayden) about preserving his precious bodily fluids, gung-ho redneck bomber pilot Major 'King' Kong (a marvelously spirited portrayal by Slim Pickens) riding a nuclear missile like a bucking bronco on its final drop while whooping it up, and the gloriously insane plan for survival that batty ex-Nazi adviser Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again at his most sublimely deranged) proposes to President Muffley.Moreover, the zestful acting from the first-rate cast keeps this movie humming: Sellers pulls off a terrific troika of impressive and highly distinctive turns as Muffley, Strangelove, and uptight RAF group captain Lionel Mandrake, George C. Scott has a field day as bellicose commie-bashing hawk General 'Buck' Turgidson, Keenan Wynn does his usual sturdy work as the gruff Colonel 'Bat' Guano, Peter Bull likewise excels as the shifty Russian ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, Tracy Reed briefly steams things up as sexy secretary Miss Scott, and James Earl Jones handles himself well in his film debut as the thorough Lieutenant Lothar Zogg. Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's sharp black and white cinematography and Laurie Johnson's rousing military marching band score. Worthy of its classic status."
"Few films are able to take a deadly serious issue and place it within the context of a broad comedy successfully.  Dr. Strangelove does exactly that. Kubrick's masterpiece illustrates in brilliant fashion the idiocy of nuclear war and the idiots who are orchestrating it. What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individual characterisations of Sellers, Scott, Hayden and Pickens. To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With names such as President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed ""war room"" set, the hand-held camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black and white cinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of ""Strangelove.""  Quite simply, the greatest American film by the greatest American director."
"This movie is absolutely brilliant! It might not be THE best movie ever made but it certainly is one of the most entertaining and fun movies ever made. It isn't even Kubrick's best but it certainly is perhaps his most accessible and entertaining movie.The movie its story and humor are subtle and perfectly makes fun of the whole Cold War situation in the '60's. With some subtle dialog Kubrick perfectly makes fun of a very serious and relevant topic. I mean, the story of this movie isn't that unlikely and could had actually really happened. As a matter of fact, it could still happen today. It's frightening but thanks to Kubrick's directing the movie never really becomes serious and remains fun, hilarious and entertaining from beginning till end. It is the only movie that makes you laugh at the end of the world.The actors are also what makes this movie fun to watch. Peter Sellers is nothing short of brilliant in the three different roles that he plays; Group Captain (G/C) Lionel Mandrake/President Merkin Muffley/Dr. Strangelove. But also George C. Scott is comically brilliant in this movie as Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and he perhaps plays his very best role. Other actors that stood out were; Slim Pickens and Peter Bull. This movie also marks James Earl Jones his very first appearance in a movie.This is perhaps the most subtle and 'darkest' comedies ever made. Everything about it is shear brilliance and even now 40 years later, it hasn't lost any of its power. The movie still looks like it could had been made a couple of months ago. A movie that will never feel outdated or too 'old fashioned' to watch. In 50 years from now, this movie will be just as good and hilarious, as it is now. Mark my words.The movie is filled with some truly classic long sequences and has countless unforgettable moments and dialog in it. Especially the last sequence, involving Dr Strangelove, is absolutely priceless and unforgettable.Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven't seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clichés... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick's most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I'm not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. I know I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10"
"This film has become a cultish film because of the subject of course but especially because of the tone that is really entirely conveyed by two actors, Peter Sellers and his three roles and George C. Scott. We could add Slim Pickens in the batch with his phenomenal dive into nuclear annihilation at the end. The subject is central in our post WW2 world since it has to do with nuclear weapons and war. These weapons have only been used once, in fact twice, by the USA against Japan in 1945. The deterring effect of the possession of such weapons is supposed to keep the world as peaceful as it can be, though we all know it is not exactly true since wars have been going on practically constantly since 1945, for oil, for uranium, for who knows what other resources or tribal heritage from the centuries of slavery imposed onto black Africa, or the centuries of rife between sects in some religions. But they were always limited geographically. Most of these wars, apart from the direct colonial wars of Great Britain (not so many) and France (essentially two in Indochina and in Algeria) were the deeds of the USA: Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East, and should I not mention Granada and Panama? The Soviet Union only had one in Afghanistan and they stepped out of it in front of the resistance from the Taliban and the Mujahedeen, armed and financed by the USA and the CIA. These movements gave rise to Al Qaeda and later ISIS. In 1964 just after the missile crisis in Cuba the world had just gone through a terrible scare and Stanley Kubrick wanted to produce a film that would make the world realize how dangerous these weapons can be and how little we can stop them when they are already in the air. He decided to make it a comedy by using Peter Sellers in three different parts in which his improvising was able to make a real hit on the psyche of an audience. And it is a success and it is still valid.The argument is that there will always be some crazy guy who will be able to bypass all limitations and firewalls to play a trick on the world, on the USSR at the time and Russia nowadays, or even China for the more reckless, and manage a bomb and today a missile to reach the other side and start the ABSOLUTELY AUTOMATIC responding defense that would become a tremendous back-attack or act of final justified but lethal compensation. As the one who started the scare in this film, and the final holocaust, says so well just before committing suicide ""I believe there is another life on the other side!"" That is in the drastic situation the most humorous, a very black humor indeed, remark you can utter.The mad Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove is the most frighteningly hilarious character you can imagine, selling his nuclear knowledge and knowhow to the USA with only one intention: to get to the nuclear holocaust he had been preparing in Germany for Hitler and he was not able to perform or achieve. He is mad, he is deranged, he is physically handicapped, he is erratic and his artificial arm is only remembering his glorious Nazi time and is taking over from time to time to salute his leader, Heil and Heil again. All that is dealt with humorously but it is dramatic and today in the situation of two wars, in Afghanistan on one side, and in Iraq- Syria on the other hand, plus the Korean situation that is poisoned by the unpredictable erratic attitude of President Trump in front of a young leader in North Korea who is either right to resist American imperialism or wrong to endanger the survival of the whole planet, today we can feel it resonate with strength and power. Can there be any reasonable tempered, and well-tempered at that, moderate and realistic compromise to find a solution to the problem without having the USA continuing in their unacceptable track of dictating what one man, one president wants, even when this is purely unethical and absurd? No one in the world, and certainly not any god in existence, has the right to dictate to other countries what they have to do and what norms they have to respect and implement: the one size fits all of the Monroe Doctrine has to be once and for all sent back to the prop-store of an out-of-use theater.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUTO DIE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, WHAT A JOY! Amazon February 11, 2001Kubrick touches a very sensitive subject in this film, a subject that should remind us of man's supreme ability at destroying himself and surviving his own destruction. He points out how any nuclear protocol has a hole somewhere or a loophole to go around any kind of security precautions. Nuclear weapons are our unredeemable doom. They can only lead to a catastrophe. And humanity is such that it will enjoy destroying itself and then mobilize its intelligence to just survive in order to start again. There is no hope what so ever. Kubrick deals with this subject in a very humorous way but every detail is there to show that the patriotic motivation of any man justifies in his mind any possible crime or just folly. Man is a fool and his foolishness can know no end. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."
"When US General Jack D. Ripper orders wing attack plan R into operation he sets his plane on an irrecoverable bombing run into Russia.  Powerless to stop them with the relevant three letter access code the President of America and his advisors plan to warn Russia as best they can to prevent as many of the planes reaching their targets as possible.  However when the Russian Ambassador warns of the doomsday machine  a machine that will destroy all life on earth in response to a nuclear attack things become desperate.  With one plane making a desperate run to it's target things look bleak.Now well respected as a superb satire on the arms race this is one of my favourite Kubrick films.  It is less cold than some of this later work and is genuinely funny without losing it's point.  The story focuses on three main areas of the attack  the military base where one crazed man launches the attack, the war room at the pentagon and the plane making the bombing run.  All these have comedy inherent in them  although thew war room is by far the best.  The story is an satire on the futility and danger of the nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue.  It may not sound funny but trust me  it is.The characters are all great and well done by the cast.  Peter Sellers excels in each of his roles and shows his quality.  As Mandrake he is funny in a very British way, as The President he has great one sided conversations with his Russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including the legendary `Gentlemen you can't fight in here  this is the war room'. However as Dr Strangelove he is hilarious  the character himself is a swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies.  Sterling Hayden is great as General Ripper  he delivers his madness with a straight face throughout (or maybe no-one told him it was a comedy!).  Slim Pickens is good and has the most famous scene from the film that has been copied in many things including Homer's fantasy in The Simpsons.  However for me the standout is George C. Scott  not exactly a comedy actor he is frantic and over the top with his communist paranoia.Overall this is a classic and deserves to be.  It is sharp today as it was then and even more relevant.  The comedy is still fresh and the dialogue is great  quite simply, when Scott implores the president to act quickly as `we must not have a mineshaft gap!' then you've arrived!"
"One of the best films ever made, this remains timeless despite changes in technology, foreign policy and world politics; the military/political madness remains the same.  Gets better all the time, with successive viewings and its luster has not dimmed since its first release.With three show-stopping performances from Sellers (amongst his best work, if not THE BEST), and an unexpectedly hilarious turn by George C. Scott (if Sellers weren't SO dead on-target, Scott would easily steal the show), STRANGELOVE is filled with cartoonish, over-the-top characters that, despite the lunacy, still ring true.  Special mention must be made for Sterling Heyden's controlled, brooding paranoia as General Jack D. Ripper.  He's funny, he's scary.All-in-all, a brilliant piece of work by all involved."
"Entertainment Weekly called this one of the funniest 100 movies ever made. It also happens to be one of the most disturbing movies made. The humor is right there in your face, however, there is always an underlining political critique under every character, every line, and every government representation. Slim Pickins is the never quit Airman. He is a representative of our entire military system of the time. The president, played beautifully by Peter Sellers, is a demure, calm presence trying to deal with the Russian premiere. His perfect counterpart is a war hungry General, ready to accuse the Russians of any small infraction. This leads to one of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Sellers also plays a British airman who has to deal with the crazed general in the usual polite British manner. Seller's third role is that of the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a former nazi and weapons designer for the Americans. He represents the scientific community of that time period; those who worked tirelessly to build a better bomb. These characters, all of them strongly parodying a cross section of society make for an odd story. The final scene, while played for laughs, is actually a frightening image of a communist future. The final moments are frightening in their truth leading one to put themselves in a position of the characters. Dr. Strangelove is the funniest disturbing film I've ever seen."
"Slowburning, satyrical nuclear war comedy about an american general who goes bananas and starts a nuclear attack on his own.The bad:
This movie is dated. And it shows: the special effects give me headaches, because they are so clumsily done. And there are lots of those clumsy effects. But it is a comedy, so who cares? Most of the jokes are completely silly, which sometimes irritates me a bit. But hey, it is a comedy, so who cares if it is completely silly now and then. The speed of this story might be way to slow for some viewers, but acting is really great and hilarious, so that evens things out a lot, for me personally.The good:
Despite all of these minor flaws that are mentioned above, ""Dr Strangelove"" is still an impressive movie about the total madness of nuclear war. However silly this comedy might be, it has got a serious message for all us viewers: a nuclear war will mean the end of all of us. There are no winners, only losers in a nuclear war, however hard some try to convince us folks of the opposite. This movie is about all those people who think that nuclear war can be good IF we strike first. Because IF WE DON'T have nuclear powers, THEY will have them. These twisted paranoid ideas could mean the end of the world as we know it and director Stanley Kubrick made a great classic comedy about it.When watching this classic movie, one must not forget that the director made this movie in an era in which the americans came close to nuclear war with the russians during the ""bay of pigs"" conflict in Cuba during the sixties. However silly this movie might be, it has got a very serious message about the dangers of nuclear power. THAT particular message is what makes ""Dr. Strangelove"" a timeless classic."
"This is Kubrick's view of our specie, not a time in history but the entire history. It is a satire during a period of paranoia about the nuclear capabilities of a single bomb around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The darker picture is always the correct one, we realize that when we look at the history of civilization, it is a repetition of the same greed, bloodshed, pride. This film depicts those characteristics in such a way that I don't believe any other movie ever did, or ever will. There is a saying: Is with a joke that great truths are told , I think that's what Kubrick did. George C. Scott made the performance of a life time, that scene with the plane shows exactly the pride over the instinct of survival. This movie is too good to be true, is humanity looking in a mirror."
"Did this movie fueled hippies with motivation and passion to do what they did?
Nevertheless, as a citizen of the former Soviet Republic, it was simply hilarious to watch an American movie (made during the pique of Cold War, which deserves additional applause to the crew) portraying that the situation and people's common belief was nearly the same even overseas: the belief that the ""enemy is near and is gonna kill all of us one way or another"". 
Jack Ripper reminded me so many acquaintances of mine who lived back in days!:D Impervious, harsh, brutal, passionately believing in his own truth and sort of a satiric character for all of the listed above. The only difference is that their favorite line was: ""It's all America again"", but in the movie you can watch the vice versa.
Great movie, yet, the question got me thinking: did both parties actually enjoy dropping another war using force and guns less than a couple of decades after the hell on Earth called WW2?
P.S. The fictional president of the US being the most sane character of the movie probably ""saved"" its reputation back in times IMHO:)
P.P.S. Spoiler: get ready for the then existing post-WW2 stereotypes about super cold and *still-kinda-nazi* Germans, cynical yet *cowboy-minded"" Americans and always up for a drink Russians :D"
"Director Stanley Kubrick made three films of absolute genius: PATHS OF GLORY (1957), DR STRANGELOVE (1963) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The first two were on the subjects of war and treason, but while the former was extremely serious, DR STRANGELOVE is a dark comedy which tells many truths about the delicate balance of the nuclear bomb and peace, in contrast with FAILSAFE, a film which came out on the same year but which approached the subject of nuclear conflict from a much more factual and formal angle.I can safely say that DR STRANGELOVE made me far more aware of the world's perilous balance, because my guffaws at some of the film's funny lines caused my mind to imagine the real consequences much more realistically than the serious-minded FAILSAFE ever could. To that end. the acting was first class: Peter Sellers is very good as a feeble US president, a powerless British commander, and the mentally disturbed Dr Strangelove, who reminds me of Werner von Braun, with his SS past and trip to the Moon future. Sadly, Sellers gives Dr Strangelove a distracting Indian accent, otherwise he is a joy to watch. George C. Scott is marvelous as the US Armed Forces commander with side interests and an eye always firmly tracked on the military solution, conveying suspicions about the Ruskies and sending shivers down your spine with his mad eyes and his confidence in US military capacity; Keenan Wynn does well with a tiny part and his quip about Coca Cola Company's power is so outlandish that it is frightening; Peter Bull is superb as the Russian ambassador called to the War Room, who uses the opportunity to take spy shots; Slim Pickens, as commander of the aircraft which delivers the bomb, is memorable in his desire to serve his beloved country, to the extent of going down with the bomb; and Sterling Hayden is also at the top of his form as the base commander who loses his marbles and orders the air attack on Russia, and then takes the coward's way out.Great photography, special effects, fitting soundtrack, and fantastic dialogue, full of sharp one-liners, always pursuing the absurd and darkly comic angle, complete the bouquet. Masterpiece! PS: And so I learned not to worry... if not quite to love the bomb!"
"What can be said about this movie? It's a classic. One of the great films. A silly comedy about a very serious subject. If you haven't seen this one yet, it's about time you did."
"Stanley Kubrick always likes to try something new with each movie he does, and this proves it. This is truly one of the grittiest, and best dark comedies I've ever seen with some crude moments and some odd ones (who'd think to have Slim Pickens riding a bomb on it's way down). It turns into a flat out masterpiece though with the spectacular acting by Peter Sellers (in three separate roles), George C. Scott (his facial expressions are a crack up every time), and a supporting cast of crazies in a government of loons, the most impressive of these being the incomparable Sterling Hayden in his best dramatic/funny role. It contains a resonance as well that sticks till today, as corruption and pig-headedness rules in all sorts of governments, but most of all in those with the most power. It's almost worth it just for the opening credits and end sequence with ""we'll meet again""."
"Who else than Stanley Kubrick could take a serious subject like the cold war and tell the story like a comedy ??? He proves his genius in this film more like in any other film of his. It's the story about one general ( with the very appropriate name Jack D. Ripper) gone mad and he launches an attack on Russia all by himself. He's mad, but still smart enough to prevent that anyone can stop him. He's got this strange ( but very funny ) theories about body-fluids, but his men respect him and do everything he says. So 34 fully-armed plains are sent to as many targets. Meanwhile his Colonel, Mandrake, tries to talk sense to him and the president and another General are trying to warn the Russian prime minister. You can have nothing but great respect for Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film and every single one of them is flawless. The doctor Strangelove character is hilarious and creepy at the same time. His appearances as the doctor are, along with the telephone conversations between the president and the Russian Prime minister the funniest moments in the film... Also the classic bomb-ride of Major Kong off course. George C. Scott is clearly having fun in his role and the debut of James Earl Jones is also definitely worth mentioning. Like I said already...a must see film if you're a film lover in general."
Still a great film to watch. I think this is one of Stanley Kubrick's best films even to this day. Mixing real life possible events with a flare of comedy!
"Stanley Kubrick's Cold War satire is one of the most poignant and witty black comedies of all time. The Cold War has now long been over with and the threat of nuclear war has diminished but the relevance of the film has not. The reason being, is that Dr. Strangelove is a film about the follies of man. So in a sense it is as relevant today as it was back in 1964. The performances are universally outstanding. Peter Sellers, playing three distinctively different roles is nothing short of amazing. No less impressive is George Scott, whose performance in the hands of a less capable actor might of come across as hokey but Scott pulls off one of the great comic performances in film history. The witty script and marvelous performances are enhanced by an impeccable black and white cinematography and Kubrick's sensitive direction. Dr. Strangelove is a can't miss masterpiece."
"I was born in the 90s. As such, I can never truly appreciate the climate people lived under during the Cold War, how much ever I read about it. I wasn't grown enough at the time of the Kargil aggression to understand the implications of two nuclear armed neighbours going for all out war. With the current atmosphere in the Indian subcontinent being of warmongering and terrorism, watching of Strangelove, a movie that I had been meaning to see for half a decade, seemed appropriate. And after watching I'm struck at how it has remained relevant.Kubrick is awesome. I have seen just two of his films, Eyes Wide Shut and now Dr. Strangelove. He seems to have an innate knack of making people uncomfortable, simply by showing them the possibilities of human behaviour, what people can do, when blinded by ideology, propaganda and a generous dose of hubris and stupidity. This biting satire and socio-political commentary of the 1960s' cold war and military-industrial complex doesn't hold back on its punches.Peter Sellers excels in his three roles. As an increasingly worried and exasperated yet unflinchingly British Captain Mandrake, he has to deal with Sterling Hayden's excellent macho nutjob General Jack Ripper, who is the embodiment of every toxic wannabe-alpha-male faux-military man you have ever seen, IRL and on screen. As the unintentionally funny yet very straightforward President of the United States, he turns in an excellent job. The phone conversations with the Premier of the Soviet Union had me laughing out loud. Finally as the sinister Dr. Strangelove, the mad genius scientist, the kind that never goes out of work because every government would want him, he is excellent. Other characters include the General Turgidson, Major Kong, and a whole host of minor military characters that do their part well to round out the cast.The film is mostly in three locations: the iconic War Room, the inside of a B-52 bomber, and the Burpelson AFB located somewhere near Russia. The screenplay is very wordy and I have no problem with that at all. This is a filmmaker at the height of his powers delivering different types of comedy through scenes, characters' actions and dialogue delivery, and the dialogue itself is enriched by the extemely clever writing.VERDICT: Kubrick is A GENIUS. 10/10.Stray observations:Dr. Strangelove's black-gloved right hand seems to be deeply loyal to Herr Hitler."
"I've watched this multiple times before. Once as a child, a few times in university, and this was the first time since. Every time I've enjoyed it more than the last.One of the times I watched it was for a joint event I organized for the MTSU Cinema Club and MTSU ACM Siggraph. The plan was double features that thematically paired a classic film with an animated film. I paired this movie with The Iron Giant, the theme being Cold War science fiction and paranoia. I had a disagreement at the time with the faculty advisor who felt I was essentially trying to turn Siggraph into Cinema Club, though no other officers of the club felt that way, nor did members. The event was actually quite a success. I'd have done more of them, but the advisor went behind the backs of the officers and canceled its advertising. As I'd said at the time, the point was to show that animated films could handle complex thematic material that we are comfortable admitting is in classic movies. I at one point nearly shouted at him that if it had been a purely cinema club event, I'd have paired Dr. Strangelove with Inglourious Basterds, the themes instead being black comedy and American xenophobia.And for years I couldn't get that movie pairing out of my head. So last night, finally, my partner and I watched them together. Both movies try and explore, in hyperbole, the ways in which we Americans have caricaturized the people's with whom we've had political strife.My major complaint about the film is one I shared with my partner, though she was the only one to verbalize, there are essentially no female characters. Well, there's one. Scott's character is sleeping with his secretary, and so she is in one scene. I'm uncertain where one could have been, given that the plot essentially all takes place in a few ""boy's clubs"".The best actor in this movie is certainly Peter Sellars, though George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden were excellent as well. Sellars plays multiple roles with different accents, costumes, and hair. (The first time, when I was a child, I didn't even notice they were all the same.) But the main reason I keep coming back to this movie is the morbid humor."
"Many reviews here say they do not like this film because it is full of caricatures, not real people. THAT IS THE POINT. My God, people here who hate this film cannot form a coherent argument as to why they hate it. One even compared it to Napoleon Dynamite. It was at that point I lost all hope for humanity, gouged out my eyeballs with two forks, and set myself on fire. I am in Hell here."
"Stanley Kubrick's pitch black satire about the nuclear threat and the ends of which mankind is capable of going to prove its superiority.The plot goes that a US general has gone rogue and ordered a nuclear attack against the Soviets. The radios have been disabled and there's no conceivable way to call off the attack. Men in the War Room argue back and forth, assigning blame, getting desperate, getting emotional. While on the skies the planes march towards Soviet airspace - undetectable, unstoppable.It's a beautiful scenario, made even more poignant by its sheer absurdity. It tells something about a movie when it opens with a message from US Air Force, stating that the thing showcased in the movie could never, ever, under no circumstance, no way, no how, happen. Now please crawl out from under your beds.And this could be an unbearably heavy movie. But Kubrick helms it as a satire. The characters are amazingly out there, as are the lines of dialogue, the sets, the music. But the subject matter is still so large, so huge, so scary, that horror lurks underneath all the comedy. It underlines every scene, every moment. Most of us now have grown up in a world where nuclear war has always been a possibility. And in this film that fact can never be forgotten.The acting is also superb with the MVP award easily going to George C. Scott, playing the role of one the president's military advisors.Fantastic scenario, fantastic film making, fantastic actors. You'll laugh, while also feeling the cold sweat dripping down your spine."
"This film is scintillating, excoriating, scorching...think of any violent word you can and it will describe this film. Forget action movies with their death counts of dozens or thousands of people. The stakes in this film are as high as they can be, with the world on the brink of nuclear war. The mechanics of military command are ruthlessly exposed and somehow I found the procedural details on B-52 bomber horribly enthralling. Oh, and it's very funny. Peter Sellars plays three roles and nails them all. The sequence of events is wonderfully absurd, except that there was a short talk before the screening I saw and the academic who spoke explained that declassified documents have revealed that the only false thing in the whole film is the disclaimer at the start (demanded by the airforce?) that says it couldn't happen. Alert to the prospect of a strategic strike on Washington that would destroy the only people capable of authorising a nuclear attack, the US government implemented a system just like the one in the film whereby individual generals could launch a nuclear strike.Similarly, the paranoia rings true - if the US had launched a nuclear attack, of course Soviet intelligence would have had every incentive to deceive those carrying out the attack into believing the order had been rescinded. And the fear of being left behind in any technological race rings true as well.Also it's hilarious: that music that plays every time the scene is on the B-52 bomber! But poignant and beautiful. The mountains sticking up above the clouds at the beginning are breathtaking and somehow sad and, particularly early on many of the shots of the plane flying are gorgeous. And the war room is such a brilliant set.So although satire can sometimes be distancing or alienating, with this film be prepared for lots of feelings."
"Yeah. It was funny. It was entertaining. It's not a bad movie by any means. I think Kubrick did a great job with the visuals and the settings. Beyond that, it's not very dramatic or suspenseful. There's not much depth or intellect. I laughed modestly a few times, but mostly, the humor consists of lazy military stereotypes. The premise was interesting. I could've done with less cockpit and gun firing scenes. Perhaps the general and his descent into madness could've used more fleshing out. I don't know. It feels like it's missing something. Maybe it's one of these meme movies like Napoleon Dynamite that you either ""get"" or you don't."
"The only other Stanley Kubrick movie I've seen is A Clockwork Orange and I quite liked it. I will eventually see more of his movies because this does take a while to get going (mainly for the reason of describing the plot really doesn't sound like the plot to a comedy) it does get insane with it's humour and it never stops. The plot is... Well I warned you this doesn't sound like a comedy - A General paranoid with fear and Xenophobia as to what The Russians are doing launches the emergency plan to nuke hot-spots and eventually start World War III, not content with just that he also locks down his own base telling his men to shoot everyone on sight if they aren't known to the soldiers personally. While this is going on American politicians and other such people that supervise war are scrambling to make sure World War III doesn't happen. We also see a fighter jet that gets the crazy General's message. As I said for a comedy this has probably one of the gloomiest plot lines in existence. Somehow they made it insane such as people prioritizing shooting a Coca-Cola vending machine over trying to call the President on a payphone or saying that the Russian President has a doomsday weapon capable of destroying the world will be revealed soon because ""He likes surprises""... That sums up the tone for this movie better than any description of the plot can ever do. I'll also say the cinematography is quite good too and the acting is suitably over the top. I'd say watch it but as I may have said earlier it does take a while to get into, at least for me anyway."
"In all the years of film making, Peter Sellers never disappointed an audience. No matter what the part, he always seem to find the perfect voice and therefore, his character. If you put him together with other equally great character actors like, George C. Scott who plays maniacal Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and Sterling Hayden as the insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Jack The Ripper?) and the Slim Pickens as Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong, James Erle Jones as Lt. Lothar Zogg, the bombardier and Peter Bull as the Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, then you not only have an award winning film, but the secret formula for a Classic. The story is set in the sixties, during the Cold War and a lunatic Air Wing Commander intentionally gives the ""Gold Code Signal for his wing to attack Russia. What follows is a dramatic minute ticking film, designed to illuminate the military's ignorance, stupidity and final acquiescence of the doomsday, 'Fail-Safe' device. The entire movie is a comedy of errors and one reflected of Standly Kubrick's genius. The one sequence where Major Kong rides a nuclear missal to its target is synonymous with the mentality of the pentagon. Through the passage of time, this superb movie has not only become a Dark Classic, but a possible statement of the future reality of the human race. ****"
"Funniest movie I have seen in my life (and for that alone, it earns my first review). There are moments during movie that you follow the dialogue and watch it progress and you feel fine, but then there are verbal 'bombs' (for lack of a better word) dropped on you and you can fall on the ground for laughing so hard.At some point in the move I was thinking: is it inappropriate that I'm entertained, and then I looked it up on IMDb to see the genre: and felt a bit relieved to see that it is indeed a comedy.The pace was so slow (and in the best way possible): you wonder how Kubrick managed to squeeze so much in so little screen time, yet nothing feels rushed, and everything gets enough time. Loved it! Recommend it to everyone!"
"Stanley Kubrick directs ""Dr Strangelove."" The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the ""purity of his essence"" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates ""Attack Plan R"", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a ""doomsday device"". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.Ripper, like most of the film's characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that ""the enemy"" is sapping his ""sexual essence"". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not ""masculine"" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.Enter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper's sneak attack. The ball's already rolling, he says, so let's roll along with it. Buck's name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).But once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He's President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to ""work with the enemy"". ""Merkin"" and ""muff"" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.On the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft's radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick's films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.The recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for ""Purity of Essence"" and ""Peace on Earth"", the code points to both party's fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated. When Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the ""doomsday device"", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it's precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.Before the film's iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps ""necessary"" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to ""fuhrers"" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the ""newly risen"" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.With ""Strangelove"" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout. The great black joke of ""Strangelove"" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film's entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a ""mating-warring association"" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like ""f*** you up"" and ""get some action"" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.The film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick's camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film's second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary ""ticking clock"" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film's (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.10/10 - Masterpiece."
"Mutually assured destruction is inherently absurd because no sane person would trigger it. Only a crazy person would do that, and once that happened all the sane people would try to prevent it. That's the basic premise of Dr. Strangelove, and Kubrick takes the concept to its absurdist end with the kind of ironic humor that obviously tickled him (with a healthy smattering of Peter Sellers, of course).General Ripper sends his air wing to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union using Wing Attack Plan R, a plan that gives him authority to strike Russian targets without presidential authority in the event of an attack that incapacitates the president. Except nothing has happened save that the conspiracy in Ripper's head has reached a point where he feels it's necessary to begin a war to wipe out the Soviet Union and preserve the purity of his bodily fluids. He's obviously gone off his rocker and out of line because only a crazy person would start a nuclear war in a place of mutually assured destruction.These actions bring the president, his cabinet, and the top brass of the military to the war room in the Pentagon. They discuss the situation, any methods to recalling the bomb wing, and how to get to Ripper to force him to recall the attack. The president also invites the Russian ambassador who reveals that the Soviet Union has created a doomsday device that detects a nuclear explosion on Soviet soil and destroys the world (the premier was going to announce its presence to the world on Monday).They do manage to get the code after overrunning the base except for one plane that has damaged communications equipment and ends up going to a target not their own where they release the bomb and initial world destruction.I've never really appreciated how funny this movie is until this viewing. Yes, Peter Sellers does have his moments (I think he's best as the British officer Mandrake), but, in terms of performance, it's George C. Scott that gets me chuckling the most. His facial expressions are wonderful acts of cartoonish emoting that fit marvelously well with the absurdity of the situation in the movie. Slim Pickens' oversized personality meshes really well with his character Major Kong.Outside of performances, the movie really embraces absurdism and irony as modes of comedy in the face of world ending consequences. The scene around the Coca Cola machine is emblematic of that. Mandrake, freed from Ripper's office where he's been trapped for some time, needs to call the president and tell him the recall code. Only the regular telephones work, so he has to come up with the change to make the call. He runs through with the operator about connecting him to the president in the Pentagon and the different options to make the call (person to person, collect, and station to station). He doesn't have enough for person to person. The Pentagon refuses the collect call. And Mandrake doesn't have enough for the station to station call either. So, he convinces the American officer escorting him to shoot the lock off the nearby Coca Cola machine for a few more cents to make one of the most important calls in world history. There's an expectation around how that sort of call should happen, and it does not involve pay phones, haggling with an operator, and getting change from a nearby soda machine. The contrast is where the funny happens, and the contrast in that situation is purely absurd.One of the things that I only really appreciated on this viewing was the absurdism at the movie's core. I used to take the film far more literally and specifically as an attack on American policy and I would quibble with it. Once I got the reading I got, everything slid into place. The very idea of mutually assured destruction is absurd and only a madman would trigger it. Once done, the rest of the sane world would come together to make sure it didn't happen. That's one reason that the calls between the American president and the Russian premier are so funny. It's two adversaries suddenly thrown together to prevent what they had been actively building up to.The movie's slyly funny in several ways, great to look at, and with some wonderfully iconic imagery. That sight of Major Kong riding the bomb to the ground is just so fantastic. There are obvious sexual metaphors everywhere, implying a Freudian connection between war and sex, that heightens the comedic value as well. This movie is a classic for good reason."
"'Gentlemen. You can't fight here this is the war room.'Stanley Kubrick is not someone who immediately comes to mind as a director of an absurdist black comedy. Yet he co-wrote and directed Dr Strangelove at a time the cold war was raging in the real world.General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who sees a communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid. He has executed a plan that allows him to override the American president and launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.In the war room, the hawkish General Turgidson (George C Scott) sees a tactical advantage on a nuclear first strike against the Soviets. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to placate the Russian president in a phone call and prevent an all out nuclear war. Although the conversation is always one sided, we never see the Russian president.Colonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British executive officer attached to Ripper tries to stop him but Ripper has gone bat crazy.Finally former Nazi German Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers) now a scientific advisor to President Muffley has an idea to survive in underground mines and eventually repopulate the planet.It is spooky to think that there are several people like Ripper and Turgidson about serving in various governments around the world. Even Dr Strangelove comes across as real, even with his arm trying to do a Nazi salute. Many ex Nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after the second world war.It is a grim black comedy about paranoia and it works because everyone is playing it straight. Slim Pickens as Major King Kong was not even aware that this was a comedy.George C Scott plays it broad but still makes Turgidson scary and silly at the same time. He gives a great performance, Sellars gives a better one in three different roles.The film has some great lines, wonderful set design such as the iconic war room and well known scenes such as Pickens sitting on a bomb as it is dropped from a plane."
Peter Sellers in his heyday does a outstanding job of acting in 3 separate performances that do not conflict with each other and provides almost a one man show. If you did not know it was him you would be most pleased with these performances. Still nevertheless they were outstanding and bright to life loose ends of this eccentric film
"The quality of the actors, their acting and the script are simply amazing and over the top. I which we had more movies like this."
"Marvelous satire from Kubrick, and one that clicks on all cylinders - visually beautiful, lots of funny moments, and sharp commentary on the military, cold war, and threat of nuclear annihilation. A perfect encapsulation of the period, and yet ahead of its time as well. Brilliant performances from Peter Sellers in his three roles, George C. Scott, and Slim Pickens. The imagery is so biting - that cowboy hat, ""peace is our profession"", and the third reich salutes. The sexual overtones throughout the film add another layer of commentary, starting with the plane refueling and in many references to virility, signaling an aspect that has always been part of the military and those who would make war (perhaps the ultimate 'toxic masculinity' ... and making me think of the George Carlin bit about it not being manly to 'pull out' of Vietnam).We see the risk to humanity from our own selves in various 'big' ways - someone going rogue, the depraved indifference over 'only' 10-20 million dying, and the irrational fear of the other side being ahead, of there being any kind of ""gap."" We also see it in our little foibles, like pettiness, jealousy, and lust, and in the ignorant belief in conspiracy theories like that around fluoridation (which was a real thing). And interestingly, we also see the risk to humanity from automation and computers getting into an irreversible, destructive state, perhaps prefetching HAL in 2001, and the concerns of AI decades later. Mostly of all though, it points out the idiocy of the arms race, prompted by living in fear - messages which are still so important today - and it does this in way that is both delightfully over the top, but also includes the essence of truth."
I just watched part of it again today (April 2019) and actually realized that there is a fundamental flaw in the plot of the script compared to the reality of the last 30 years. It is not the general that are crazy and want to make war - it is the politicians. I like intellectual material but I have never found this movie very gripping or perhaps its satire like much of sellers is too broad for me. I appreciate his work - but I always find him a bit flat. I can't rate it less than a 9 - or I will lose credibility. But overall the movie still doesn't hit me as much as it does other people.
"Hilarious and very intelligent (also terrifying at the time it was made) Cold War black comedy that completely reveals insanity and absurdity of the Cold War paradigms. General gone mad decides on his own to start nuclear war, unaware that the Soviets made ""The Doomsday Machine"" - a bomb capable of producing enough radioactive fallout to destroy entire life on Earth, which is automatically activated by a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union..."
"The film definitely is a masterpiece if it comes down to demonstrate the irrationality of cold war rationality. How better to illustrate that cold war rationality only works out if all players involved always act rationally. Should we really be surprised about someone getting paranoid with all the ongoing propaganda involved?Also the action that follows the lonesome and paranoid decision of General Ripper to launch a nuclear attack is strongly influenced by emotions and human weaknesses that are hardly compatible with cold war rationality. In the Pentagon war room General Turgidson (great performance by George C. Scott) wants to return as quickly as possible to his girlfriend, the Soviet president turns out to be drunk, commander Kong of the decisive B52 bomber is taking his decisions based on a Texan cowboy attitude and Dr. Strangelove, the scientific advisor to the US government, turns out to be a left over screwy Nazi, just to name a view. This may seem to be a bit overdone but when watching the movie it does not seem to be completely unrealistic, especially when compared to some actual political narcissisms and in the end, the movie is meant to be a sharp satire. Only be aware that the laughter may get stuck in your throat.The only safe harbors with concern to rationality seem to be the American president Muffley and the British Group Captain Mandrake, both convincingly plaid by Peter Sellers. Unfortunately this will not be enough to prevent the catastrophe, also owing to the safety precautions that were originally designed to correct lonesome misjudgments but which are paranoid in themselves.Quite remarkable is also the fact, that the movie is almost entirely restricted to 3 locations, i.e. military air base Burpelson, the war room in the Pentagon and the interior of a B52 bomber. This is enough to tell the whole story, in which also a Coca Cola vending machine plays an important role besides the fluoridation of water, but see for yourself."
"The year is 1964. The world is starting to regain his consciousness fro WW2 and just entered the Cold War era. People are full of fear about the nuclear war. And in those days were the American film industry was launching movies about spies and Russian espionage, one of the greatest (if not the greatest) movie director of all time creates also a movie about nuclear war only this one is a bit... different. ""Dr. Strangelove"" is not a film that glorifies America neither Russia. Is a film that satires both this countries and the ""ideology"" of war in general. Peter Sellers is doing one of the best performances of his whole carrier in his triple role in the film; As group captain Lionel Mandrake a British RAF exchange soldiers who has the bad luck of being locked in the same room with the maniac that launched the attack, as President of the United States Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove a former Nazi and now nuclear war expert. All three of this roles are presented excellent from one of the most talented actors ever. All of them are caricatures and are mocking the principles that each one represent. Also we have an amazing performance by George C. Scott in the role of General Buck Turgidson an aggressive and jingoist Chief of Staff. But this is not a movie which is only worthy for the performances. The topic is so modern even for today's standards that makes this film so accurate is almost scary. While it's a comedic film it is not funny. It's hilarious of course because of the characters and the amazing dialogue, but in the back of your mind you know that it's not the characters that you are laughing with but the human stupidity. And there's a lot of human stupidity in this film. Watch it, have fun, but above all think."
"No film has so brilliantly combined broad comedy and sharp satire to the degree of ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" — before or since. Stanley Kubrick made many incredible films in his lifetime, but none of them have the unique, distinctive edge of ""Strangelove."" The prodigious auteur made plenty of anti-war films both prior to and following this film, but it's ""Strangelove's"" manifold comedic gifts that elevate it to the level of classic.Anchoring the entire film is comedic genius Peter Sellers playing three vastly different characters with impeccable prowess, a feat that still has no equivalent. He loses himself complete into the roles of Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove — it would be no surprise that if shown to large number of people without any previous knowledge of the film or Sellers, that a large percentage of that group would not realize all three characters were the same actor. He's brilliant, on a whole other level.""Dr. Strangelove"" imagines a ludicrous doomsday scenario in which a rogue Air Force general, Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) sends codes to initiate a massive nuclear offensive on the U.S.S.R., enacting a plan/loophole that would allow him and only him to send the codes that could abort the mission. Ripper holes himself up in his base with Mandrake, who is subjected to his wild conspiracy theories and warped world view. Meanwhile, in the Pentagon War Room, Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs the president and they weigh their options.The script, written by Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George (based on George's non- satirical book ""Red Alert"") expertly skewer the Cold War mindset at a time when nuclear war was still a paralyzing concern in the world, especially America. The strength of the writing lies in the way the characters behave and say things that are exaggerate but don't feel implausible. Turgidson talking about the benefits of killing 20 million people as opposed to 150 million has both validity and absurdity to it and proves that such drastic matters are better off out of the hands of men. And how deep the trenches of distrust and machismo go in regards to the arms race and other ""races"" against the Soviets is both insane and reflective of how some people probably felt.The action of ""Dr. Strangelove"" is largely contained to the deck of a B-52 bomber, the War Room and the military base where Ripper and Mandrake are hunkered down, so Kubrick has to flex the more subtle filmmaking muscles to tell this story in a compelling way. He balances both long takes from a single, wide angle and meticulously strung together, more suspenseful sequences with lots of close-ups. He manufactures a good amount of tension considering the humor of the entire film prevents it from being a thriller like its equally excellent (but for different reasons) cinematic peer, Sidney Lumet's ""Fail- Safe."" Nevertheless, ""riveting"" isn't among the words that best describe ""Strangelove.""Instead, ""hilarious"" and ""sad"" are more apt. The film's biggest action sequence takes place at the base in a battle between American forces — the ones ordered by Ripper to protect the base at all costs and the ones ordered by the president to stop Ripper. Kubrick doesn't shy from filming an all-out war scene and the result is comedy at its absolute blackest. The ""Peace is Our Profession"" billboard is delightful (and sadly non- contrived) irony.""Dr. Strangelove"" can be interpreted in the more academic sense countless ways, but it really comes down to the comedic achievement. Most films that insist on big performances and other over-the-top elements don't have the intelligence in the writing and storytelling to buoy that kind of swing for the fences. ""Strangelove"" does thanks to Kubrick's meticulous direction, Sellers' other-worldliness and a comedic conceit that's dead on for its time and place.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Hyperbolic fun, with strange characters to highlight the point. Has a unique story that is executed very well and tries to show what could possibly happen if nuclear weapons were used.I enjoyed the characters of Buck and Mandrake, both are unlike any other characters I have seen before. Buck has a great delivery of lines with his booming voice whereas Mandrake has a likable charm. The president was very interesting too, his conversations on the phone are so absurd they become funny. However, sometimes I found it a little hard to follow the plot.The editing and cinematography are very good too, with a large long shot that is contrasted with an extreme close up later. This highlights the tension between the characters and is key to the understanding of the film. Overall, a great satire with great cinematography."
"Stanley Kubrick's political masterpiece ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is a brilliant satire on the cold war as we follow absurd characters trying to deal with a rogue general and his order to bomb the enemy. While this isn't Kubrick's first impressive work, this one did separate himself as a filmmaker who genuinely and courageously follows his vision without much regard for outside opinion or public reaction. A daring and controversial picture, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a satirical and darkly comical take on a potentially genocidal war which could understandably anger audience members at the time. The film is filled with situational, tonal, cosmic, and dramatic irony that make this film anything but a casual time at the movies. In fact, it's best to see this film more than two or three times to pick up on new jokes and humor that normally go unnoticed. Peter Sellers and George C. Scott offer ridiculous and characterized performances that feel so cartoonish we can't help but laugh. Together, they paint this picture of politics in the most absurd way. Yet at the same time, we feel that it could be plausible given the clearly defined character needs and wants. Kubrick helps us believe in the characters (notwithstanding their unbelievable behavior) by placing them in relatable circumstances and exposing them for their basic human needs and desires despite being in grave danger: survival and sex. Yes, the drive to survive and the constant subtle and obvious situations of reproducing as a means of not only distraction, but actual motivation for characters. ""Dr. Strangelove"" remains a brilliant satirical piece that's wonderfully written, engaging, and eternally re-watchable. While the humor may be too subtle for most audiences to pick up on first viewing, ""Dr. Strangelove"" deserves a chance by the new generation of moviegoers. It's fantastic and while not easily accessible to everyone, worth the effort to try and understand because it will not disappoint."
"Dr. Strangelove was a film that changed the way I looked at movies. I had just started to get more interested in movies at the time, and my roommate had the DVD and I was interested, so I popped it in, and it changed the way I looked at film.Watching Dr. Strangelove, I experienced emotions that I had never experienced before while watching film. It was gripping. I was physically distraught at the thought that one man's foolish actions could destroy the world, and even watching it without growing up in the Cold War, I still felt fear at the thought that a pitiless machine could right then destroy life as I knew it. But despite this anxiety, I still laughed several times during the film. It was the best of satire, portraying something as both real and absurd.No film is perfect, though, and some parts do move slower, and some juxtaposition by George C. Scott is a little grating and predictable. But despite all that, I would highly recommend this movie to any film lover."
"Regardless of the many classic films Stanley Kubrick made over the years, he started out his career with a very bad one.  The same goes for James Cameron who, after his debut with a disastrous Piranha-sequel, only made superb films since the year 1984.Even though I respect everybody's opinion regarding this film, I find it very hard to believe that ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a brilliant and hilarious masterpiece.  Personally, I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen.  And since there wasn't a single joke in this film that amused me, it simply has to be one of the most boring comedies ever made.  The acting was below average, but that's because the film is filled with many tiresome characters.  Peter Sellers, normally a good actor, also fails in saving this picture.I've tried to watch and enjoy this film twice, but in both cases it was too monotonous to finish it.  It would have been so much better if Kubrick had left out those stupid jokes that ruin the movie and make a war-drama instead.  The one and only interesting thing about this film is Kubrick focusing on how it's possible for one man to start a war after going completely insane.  Unfortunately, this quite original idea does not work well in a bizarre comedy such as this one here.  With a slightly better storyline and less boring characters, ""Dr. Strangelove"" truly might have become worth watching.And that explains the very good reason why this is Kubrick's first and only comedy.  He's one of the best directors of all time, but he's not capable of making a decent comedy; so much has been proven here.  Of course you can't blame the man for trying out different kinds of genres.  As far as I know, Stanley Kubrick is one of the most varied film directors of all time."
"A great movie, made all the greater by Kubrick's willingness to treat a deadly serious subject with a fabulous combination of satire and black humour. The futility of the nuclear deterrent and the twisted, inescapable logic of mutually assured destruction is brought slamming home in a perfect movie that does everything film should do. You can't ask for more if you've been amused, thrilled, shocked and forced to reflect on a giant issue!The question I suppose now is what we should take from this today. The bombs are still about, the arguments for having them seem the same, and politicians seem just as ready to reach ridiculously extreme positions very easily. Plus, we still have 'fail safe' systems to stop them from launching, don't we? Well, don't we? It's awfully frightening when you think about it. The bombs might be targeted elsewhere for now, but lets not forget about them.This must have been a real eye-popper in 1964. It is even more amazing that after the end of the cold war these babies still exist. What price a remake either real or on celluloid?"
"Classic black anti-war comedy with magnificent acting by all-star-cast , lavish production design by Ken Adam and masterfully realized by the always original Stanley Kubrick . It deals with an insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden was patterned after Gen. Thomas S. Power, LeMay's protégé and successor as Chief of the Strategic Air Command) triggers a path to nuclear holocaust that a war room full of politicians and generals frantically try to stop . There intervenes a motley group of offbeat characters such as a scientist (Peter Sellers was paid $1 million, 55% of the film's budget ,Stanley Kubrick famously quipped ""I got three for the price of six"") whose artificial arm repeatedly makes Heil Hitler sign as an involuntary reflex action , a hawkish general named Buck Turgidson (gunchewing militarist excellently performed by Geoge C Scott , this character was patterned after the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. Curtis LeMay, who was renowned for his extreme anti-Communist views) and the US President Merklin Muffley (inimitable Peter Sellers , this role was patterned after Adlai Stevenson II, who lost two presidential elections to Dwight D. Eisenhower )to deal with consequences a nuclear attack .This splendid film contains unforgettable scenes such as a soft drinking vending machine dispute , sketches involving a phone call to the American President and the movie's funniest the notorious Slim Pickens's wild ride on the bomb . Based on the novel ""Red Alert"" by Peter George, and originally conceived as a tense thriller about the possibility of accidental nuclear war. Stanley Kubrick was working on the script when he realized that many scenes he had written were actually quite funny , he then brought in Terry Southern to turn the story into a satire . This was the final collaboration between controversial Stanley Kubrick and his producing partner James B. Harris , as he left to begin his own directing career. Harris was involved in the early development stage of this production. It was during this stage that, according to Harris, Kubrick began to toy with the idea of turning it into a comedy .Very good acting by Sterling Hayden as a crazed general initiating a nuclear attack on the Soviets and George C. Scott was reputedly annoyed that Stanley Kubrick was pushing him to overact for his role , while he vowed never to work with Kubrick again, Scott eventually saw this as one of his favorite performances and many fans consider it some of his best work on-screen . And of course, the great Peter Sellers who plays a tour-de-force triple role , as he improvised most of his lines . Sellers plays Dr. Strangelove , a wheelchair-bound adviser who apparently suffers from agonistic apraxia, also known as ""alien hand syndrome¨ , an useless President and General Ripper's assistant . As Columbia Pictures agreed to provide financing only if Peter Sellers played at least four major roles , in their eyes, Sellers playing multiple roles was one reason Lolita (1962) was so successful. Peter Sellers was the first actor to be nominated for a single Academy award , best actor , for a film in which he portrayed three different characters in the same film . Furthermore , an awesome support cast with triumphant acting from Keenan Wynn as Col. 'Bat' Guano , Slim Pickens as Maj. 'King' Kong , Peter Bull as Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky , Tracy Reed as Miss Scott and film debut of James Earl Jones. This was apparently one of the first films in which the US Air Force's new B-52 Stratofortress bomber was featured. It appeared in a number of films afterward, notably A Gathering of Eagles (1963), and By Dawn's Early Light (1990) and the first Bombers B 52 (1957) . In fact , in the early 1960s the B-52 was cutting-edge technology. Access to it was a matter of national security , the Pentagon refused to lend any support to the film after they read the script , as set designers reconstructed the B-52 bomber's cockpit from a single photograph that appeared in a British flying magazine. Atmospheric musical score by Laurie Johnson , including some classic songs . Brilliant Cinematography in white and black by Gilbert Taylor , being Stanley Kubrick's last black and white film. . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Stanley Kubrick , as research, he read nearly 50 books about nuclear war . This is probably the most famed picture -with the possibly exception of 2001 A space odyssey- of the relatively infrequent movies directed by this extraordinary filmmaker."
