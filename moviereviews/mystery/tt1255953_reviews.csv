Reviews
"When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve."
"A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.A Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search, flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.There are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. It is the third great film (and arguably the best)that I've seen on this topic after Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon. All of these are essential viewing."
"""Incendies (Scorched)"" opened in town this Friday, just days before it made the short list of nominees for Best Foreign Film for this year's Academy Awards. It played in the Vancouver International Film Festival 2010, but I missed it then.Fortunately, it received theatrical distribution; this devastating film on the horrors of conflict and its enormous human costs simply must be seen. Denis Villeneuve's searing work, his fourth feature, is based on the celebrated play of the same name by Montreal native and artistic director of the French Theatre at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa Wajdi Mouawad. While there is no doubting the immediacy and impact it must have had as a piece of theatre, ""Incendies"" benefits from the transition to the larger canvas of the big screen, appropriate for the epic themes and emotional conflagrations it tackles.When their mother dies and her will is read, twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan are stumped by its bizarre burial instructions. Nawal Marwan states that she must be interred naked and facing away from the sun in an unmarked grave, until the two letters she has left with the family notary are delivered on her behalf. One is addressed to the father the twins believed dead, the second to a son whose existence comes as a complete surprise to them. The will makes the twins realize that they did not know their mother at all. They have not had an easy relationship with her, and are understandably reluctant to comply with her terms.The daughter Jeanne moved away and found refuge in the abstract realms of pure mathematics. Her sibling Simon, who remained at home, had the more complicated relationship because he dealt daily with Nawal's strangeness. Jeanne agrees to deliver the letter that was left to her, and embarks on an odyssey of discovery, in search of the father she has never known. Later, she convinces Simon to join her.Although the Middle Eastern country is never named in the film, Wajdi Mouawad ascribes the inspiration for his play to Soha Becharra, a woman who was imprisoned for six years in Khiam, southern Lebanon. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, he explained ""For me, the success of this play and the film is a way to give back some life to a woman whose life was taken away from her."" The cinematic endeavor is hugely, powerfully successful: as Jeanne scours an alien land for clues of her mother's past, we see Nawal's tough life in flashback in the same locations that her daughter visits for the first time. Sectarian strife, tribal and religious warfare, family blood feuds, and honor killings have been the blight of the Middle East and areas as far as Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan, and parts of Africa. Bloodshed and violence have been a way of life; each side claims to be justified in killing to avenge earlier injustices. While humankind has not lost its baser urges—we just have to recall the recent incident of the young Afghani woman whose nose was hacked off, or the countless rapes in present day DR Congo—the film is a plea for reconciliation and forgiveness to bring about the much needed change.Nawal barely escapes an honor killing due to her unwed pregnancy, gives up her baby son for adoption, and spends the rest of her life looking for this lost child. Along the way, she takes sides in the violence and is imprisoned for fifteen years for shooting a political leader. Upon her release, she begins life anew in Canada with her infant twins, the outcome of brutal rape at the hands of a torturer. Regardless of the change in geography, she remains haunted by the past and her unending quest for her lost child. How does one look for reparation and justice, when the perpetrators frequently flee the country of their misdeeds and seek asylum elsewhere? As she has not kept her word to her son to return to him, she feels unworthy of a proper burial. A character in the film wisely observes that death always leaves its traces, and Jeanne and Simon finally get to know their mother from the relics of her life.The Belgian actress Lubna Azabal's heroic performance brings Nawal to awe-inspiring Brechtian life. Undefeated by each dehumanizing blow, she stoically navigates a war-crazed world devoid of any sense, her driving force is the need to reunite with her son. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette do excellent work as the siblings who gradually begin to understand their mother. Rémy Girard and Allen Altman, playing the Canadian and Middle Eastern notaries respectively, guide the siblings through their search, while Abdelghafour Elaaziz makes an impact in the small but important role of Abou Tarek the torture specialist. The rest of the characters are brought to life by a talented cast of unknown actors; in their hands, even the smallest roles acquire great significance. Denis Villeneuve's film honors the stories of these people by rigorously avoiding directorial excesses. Events and stories this powerful do not require embellishment, and Villeneuve's spare, dispassionate directorial style maximizes impact.Someone remarked that ""Incendies"" is the closest contemporary approximation of Greek tragedy, and I agree with this assessment: the crimes and consequences are universal and timeless, and if a film holds up a mirror to question our capacity for barbarism, it is reason to applaud. Regardless of the outcome at the Academy Awards, ""Incendies"" is a major achievement for Canadian cinema."
"Denis Villeneuve has created nothing less than a masterpiece. This film is revealing a great Director, especially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions.Despite being skeptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan, when dealing with the very specific, multidimensional Lebanese drama, the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan's landscape especially with the film's photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious.Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen, many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it.This has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars. And it will win."
"This film is extraordinary on just about every level. The script is terrific, the actors are perfect, the direction and cinematography are all you could hope for. I recommend it without hesitation.Anyone who has seen any of Villeneuve's previous work--or Andre Turpin's Zigrail--knows that these filmmakers have bodies of work that are almost without peer in contemporary cinema world-wide and are unparallelled in the history of Canadian cinema (until seeing Incendies, Maelstrom was my favourite Canadian film). Incendies does not betray that ""legacy"". You should absolutely see it.In a film as stunning as this one it's odd to single out one aspect, but I must say that Lubna Azabal's performance is among the best I've ever seen. Though I've watched a few films that she's been in in the past, she never really stood out for me. She is devastatingly good in this picture.I do hope that this film gets submitted to the AMPAS for Oscar selection as it is definitely the best film I've seen this year and a shoe-in for the foreign picture Oscar.My only complaint about the film was the use of music by Radiohead, which took me out of the film each time it played. The rest of the music cues were spot-on and quite excellent, but Thom Yorke's voice belonged nowhere near this film."
"The film begins in sweeping slow motion, centered around a harsh cemented premises with a bunch of boys undergoing the shaving of their hair ala military fashion, with the camera centered on one boy possessing this crazed looking eyes, before cutting to Canada where twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette respectively) arrive at a notary's office to accept the will of their recently deceased mother Nawal (Lubna Azabal), where they are left with letters to deliver to a father and brother that they do not know. In the meantime, they are to bury their mother in a certain strange way until their quest has been completed, with the notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard), Nawal's boss the last few years, ensuring that her last will and testament is completed the way it was intended.Incendies, based upon the play Scorched written by Wajdi Mouawad and adapted for the screen by director Denis Villeneuve, was this year's Best Foreign Language Film nominee from Canada, and there's every reason why it was a nomination well deserved. Set against a mystery to be unraveled so slowly, bringing together seemingly disparate events together in shocking fashion by the time we're through, the narrative is split into two different timelines, with the current one being the twins' journey to an unnamed Middle Eastern country in search for clues to their unknown father and brother, while with each milestone achieved of sorts, we get to see a flashback to the time of their mother, brought up in a harsh environment involving the staining of family honour, as well as religious zealots and militants who set her off in a tale of an avenging angel, and sacrifice.And the story sprawls in many directions, though with Villeneuve always having an assured hand in not having this fall into melodramatic terms nor have any wasted scenes, highlighting issues that still exist to this very day involving hatred, revenge and forgiveness, but not before laying down a number of surprises that will shake you to the core especially when the mysterious equation finally gets solved – you may get a hint of what's to come, but this got handled so expertly without being verbatim, that it accentuates and compounds the myriad of complex emotions felt by all the characters involved.With sweeping cinematography that's achingly beautiful to gaze at, one of the best scenes involve the brutal, cold blooded mass murder where militants spray countless of rounds into a packed bus, culminating in that shot of a burning bus shrouded in thick black smoke against an endless sandy environment, with Nawal finally snapping into making a decision to take matters into her own hands from then on. Between the two stories, perhaps it is Nawal's painful journey that makes this compelling viewing, from having her lover forcefully and terminally separated from her by family during her teens, then her volunteering and sacrifice leading to imprisonment and ill treatment within as punishment. What she did as part of reconciliation is in part a masterstroke in inflicting inexplicable pain in return to her perpetrator, is what made this film a winner, although it will stun you into silence well after the end credits roll from the devastation the narrative left in its wake.The other half of the narrative deals with Jeanne and Simon's journey to dig through unwritten laws, and reluctance of tightly knit communities that prefer to keep the status quo and not dwell and reopen wounds inflicted from their collective shameful past, some in denial, while others happy to have seen a more favourable outcome from Nawal's hardships. It is this piecing together of the mystery like an investigative drama that makes Incendies unique, and what more, Radiohead also features in the soundtrack – strange but true, and very powerful if you ask me.Comparing the ratings between this film at M18 and Womb at R21 reveals what the censors allow and not allow when dealing with more mature themes, likely centered around the intention of its more controversial scenes. It's anyone's guess why was was given the highest rating possible, and the other one rung lower, given that both actually didn't have anything explicit, except perhaps one was used as an unintentional weapon of torture and destruction in the psychological sense, while the other was a love story gotten out of control! Still, for its strong story and excellent production values, Incendies becomes that must watch film in 2011, especially during this season of noisy summer action blockbusters that absolutely don't resonate as much as this film. Highly recommended!"
"During the reading of the will of their mother's, a twin brother and sister learn of some unusual last wishes. Amongst other requests, two envelopes need to be delivered to respectively the father of the two and a brother whom are both unknown. The quest leads the twins through the Middle East where they slowly learn of the horrific tales which is the life history of their late mother.The movie tells a very graphic but endearing story, perfectly shot and acted allowing the viewer to get fully immersed into the journey and findings of the twins. Through flashbacks we learn about the hardship of the mother and, eventually, the fate of the father and brother. As a treat, there is a great twist at the end which is really the icing on the cake.Highly recommended.92/100"
"Want to see where one of the modern era's hottest directing streaks started? If you do, then Incendies in the film for you.Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival and last year's brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049, Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family, war, life and death never gets muddled as we're drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.There's not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve's deft hand with his performers, his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go, that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters, the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.Saying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core, a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they've never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away, Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars, as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.The film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.Final Say - For any fans of Villeneuve's work, world cinema or powerful character driven dramas, then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release, this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era's great filmmakers.5 swimming pools out of 5"
"I had the pleasure of attending a screening of Incendies at the Telluride film festival and was absolutely shattered by it. This meticulously crafted film was my favorite of the festival. Stuff happens and you'll be like NO WAY and then the film goes even further and you'll be like WHOA OKAY WHAT and then even further and you'll be like OH MY GOD and then even further still and you'll be like HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING OH MY GOD PLEASE and then it'll just keep going even further and further and further and by the end of the film you'll just be a steamy, shattered mess like I was.Characters and events throughout are depicted with the subtlety and prowess of a master filmmaker. I don't want to spoil anything, but there were numerous moments in the screening that I attended when the audience was vocally reacting to moments on screen that were extremely visceral and affecting. Beautiful, powerful film."
"This is a superb film. Best film of the year in my estimation bar none. This exceptional Canadan film should easily win best Foreign film at the Oscars. Directing, photography, cinematography, casting, acting all outstanding. The film also has something to say on the nature of hate and violence. Unfortunately this wonderful film will neither be seen nor appreciated by a wide audience. Denis Villeneuve has created a fabulous film. He has done an immense job taking this from novel to the screen."
"I decided to watch this movie because I have read many excellent critics and because this book is used in Quebec's ""cegeps"", some kind of a post-high-school, and my girlfriend talked about it with me. Indeed, I am very happy to have seen this intense movie. It is really a great and close to perfection. Even though I have even seen one or two better films this year, this movie is at least the best drama I have seen in the last five years.This movie is absolutely convincing. It has very intense images and words and has a very slow paced and sad atmosphere. The movie begins very calm but the tension raises very fast and you really feel more and more with the tragic characters. This movie makes you cry, it makes you angry, it shocks you. Once again, it is a Quebecker movie that is cut into pieces and may mix you up a little bit in the beginning. You see scenes from the present where Jeanne and Simon are first parallely looking for the truth and trying to fulfil her last will, you see scenes from the dramatic past of her mother at different stages of her life and you also see scenes from the past of her family. The movie shows not only a couple of interesting and diversified characters (played by mostly unknown and indeed extremely talented actors), but also magnificent and intense landscapes, shocking crime and war scenes and insights of a foreign culture and the clash of the generations and ideologies in the past and the present. The movie is much diversified and very intellectual.Many people were surprised by several twists and a very intense and dramatic ending. It is true that the development the movie takes is really shocking but I have seen a few things coming and wasn't that surprised in the end, but that almost does no harm to the atmosphere and tension of the movie. The movie tells in a very philosophical way about the irony of fate, peace and war, love and hate, vengeance and forgiveness, saints and sinners. It is uneasy to watch the movie and you still think about what you have heard and seen for quite a while after the movie.Almost everything is perfect in this movie. There are two minor reasons why I don't give the best note. First of all, I was somehow able to predict some of the punches at a certain point in the movie and I have already seen more intense and shocking dramas that very even more uneasy and heavier to watch than this one, for example ""The pianist"". Second, some scenes in the beginning of the movie are not done very well by the camera man. In the scene where Jeanne is in her mathematic class and when she looks for some accessories in her room, the camera is disturbingly shaking and moving all the time but not to create an effect of uneasiness, because there are no similar scenes later in the movie during way heavier scenes. Those two scenes (that would not have been complicated to produce or film again) are just not well done and the director should have seen and corrected that before sending the final product to the festivals and cinemas. In a perfect and intense masterpiece, this little detail is really something that could harm the reputation and professionalism of the whole brilliant work. The next time, they should be more concentrated on the movie's perfection and keep their eyes open or invest the money in a good camera director instead of some war scenes.But all in all, I think that we can really talk about an extremely good movie here! It is surely worth watching it and I agree with those ones who would like to see this movie represent Canada at the Oscars."
"In Canada, the sixty year-old immigrant secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) passes away and the notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard), who had been her employer and friend for seventeen years, reads her will to her twin son and daughter Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin), who is a mathematician.Nawal requests to be buried naked with her face down and her tomb without a gravestone; further, she leaves three sealed envelopes addressed to the twins' father that they believed had deceased in the Middle East; to their unknown brother; and the last one to themselves to be opened only after the delivery of the other two. Then, they may put a gravestone on her tomb. Simon is reluctant to respect his mother last wishes, but Jeanne decides to find her biological father and brother.She travels to the Middle East to track down the past life of her mother and she discovers who she was before moving to Canada. She feels disturbed with the revelations and asks Simon to come to the Middle East to assist her in her journey. Simon discovers who his father and his brother are and concludes that one plus one may be equal to one.""Incendies"" is an intriguing film about the journey of two twin siblings that travel to the Middle East to fulfill the last wish of their mother and end discovering the disturbing history of their family.The screenplay is very well written and discloses in parallel to the journey of Jeanne first and Simon later, the brave history of their mother in an unnamed country in the Middle East. The plot point in the conclusion is totally unexpected and heartbreaking. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Incêndios"" (""Fires"")"
"Some viewers may regard the climax of 'Incendies' as the most effective part of the film, but I must wholeheartedly disagree . If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.With such an unforgettable iconic scene, as listed above (along with a few others, such as the 'honor killing' at the beginning of the film), why must 'Incendies' ultimately be labeled as contrived and dishonest? For starters, Villenueve only vaguely alludes to the film's main setting. We know that Nawal's journey occurs in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War but the country, along with the right wing Arab Christian party, the ""Phalangists"", are never mentioned by name. When Nawal's family members murder her lover, they refer to him as a ""refugee"" not as a ""Palestinian"". Despite stripping the events depicted in the film of their political context, Villenueve clearly cannot hide his bias. Nawal decides to become an assassin for the Muslims after her Muslim lover is murdered by her own Christian family and she's a witness to the bus massacre by Arab Christian terrorists. Only a ""kindly"" Muslim warlord (""Chamseddine"") happens to tell Narwan's son, Simon, the truth during the search for the ""son"" and the ""father"". And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat—one reprisal begets another. Nonetheless, Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here. By no means am I trying to defend the brutality of the right-wing nationalists during the Lebanese Civil War, but there were two sides to the story and certainly that's lost in Villenueve's narrative.As to why the film should be considered contrived, it's not so much the wacko ending which is designed to point out the horrors of war (and hence its pointlessness) but the whole idea that the mother would send her children on a wild goose chase, making them face the truth about HER situation, instead of telling them what happened on her deathbed (she was able to blurt out the main points to family friend, the Notary Lebel) or allowing Lebel to explain it to the kids without having them experience the full impact of the horror by traveling to Lebanon, dredging up old wounds amongst people who they didn't know (and didn't even speak their language). I question whether any mother would have put her children in such a position—why was she so insistent on having them learn the truth about their parentage? After all, the revelation that her son was actually her other children's father, basically drove her insane and led to her death. This from a woman who always claimed she would do anything for her children. And here they would end up in a foreign country, asking sensitive questions which could place their lives in jeopardy.While a series of chilling events, clearly molded Narwan's character, there's little character development when it comes to the son. He has that most disagreeable chip on his shoulder (until he finally bonds with his sister in the swimming pool), but for most of the film, he is an unwelcome, one-note presence. And what's with that lack of hesitation with taking a ride blind-folded with the Warlord's bodyguards? The guide's assurance that ""everything is okay"" is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers. How does he know that his guide can be so sure about the Warlord?And what about Abou Tarek (the 'son' and the 'father')? The Warlord trains him to be a crackerjack sniper but becomes disaffected by war and switches sides, ending up in the Christian Arab prison, as Narwan's torturer. Even though we hear the explanation from Chamseddine, it seems a little too convenient that Tarek so easily switches from the Muslim to the Christian Arab side with so little explanation. Of course without him doing so, there's no 'twist ending', designed to shock.I understood that the two letters which Narwan has her children deliver to Tarek reflects Narwan's ambivalence about how she feels toward him. But again, why involve the twins? How is Narwan so sure that her revelation to him that he's her son, will impact his conscience? It's already been established that he's a psychopath so I would hardly think that he would care who his mother is. For all we know, Tarek may have decided to go after the half-siblings, as they could reveal his dark secret publicly and cause him a good deal of trouble.'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias. It's worth seeing but hardly deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it since its heralded release."
"Incendies starts with twins a brother and a sister receiving a letter from their late mother. The letter sends them on a mission to find the truth about their backgrounds. The main problem with this film is the purpose of the letter. Why does the mother send them on this mission? The truth revealed is cruel and shocking? The mother has died after finding out the truth, now she wants her children to go on a mission to find the truth rather than reveal to them the truth through the letter. One could argue that the mother wanted to reveal the truth and reveal the horror and the pointlessness of the Middle East conflict. But the journey is contrived and feels as though the screenwriter just wanted to use the incest as shock value."
"It started well, though. Mysterious last will and testament with missions to accomplish... Adorable french Canadian accent (I'm french, I love what our cousins have done with our common language ). A Quebec thriller, yeah !Rapidly, first eyebrow raisers... What Arab place are they talking about like everyone should know about it ? Never heard of it...Then you realize the Arab country they are going to is just an archetypal Arab country, non existent. A caricature of many seen-on-TV Arab countries... OK, why not, I suppose Americans (as people living on the American continent) have a lesser history burn with Arab countries than Frenchs, for example, do, and have no problem building a make-believe Arab country just for the sake of... what? At this point, I supposed the filmmakers wanted to make some point about Arab or religious wars... or terrorism... ? Since they are Canadians, not Unitedstatesians, I was hoping maybe for a not so obvious / good vs bad kind of story... But I was really wondering what was the purpose of all that.The story goes on, civil war, religious war, slaughter, all fake, all archetypal, OK, but to what end? What's the point?And then, you finally get the answer, at the end of the movie, with one unforeseen big plot twist.And then you realize the Arab story is absolutely irrelevant. The same plot could have been set in any archetypal place with a credible history of violence and torture... South America? Former Yugoslavia? Caucase? Heck, actually, since the prison/torture part is altogether sufficient to hold the whole movie, the very same movie could have been set just about Guatanamo (and viewers would then believe for one hour they were watching a anti-US movie, only to realize at the end the total irrelevance of all that)At the end of the movie, you get that astonishing plot twist, which makes you realize the vast vacuity and uselessness of all the side stories you have been watching for the past hour. But, OK, what next ? What to do with that extraordinary situation ?Well, nothing. Movie ends here. Tadaaaa.And loopholes appear : there's obviously a wrong choice of actors : one of them should really look like twenty years older that what he looks like. The lawyer, since he wrote all three letters, should have understood much earlier the whole thing: it never shows that he knows more than the others participants to the quest. Weird.Good acting. I loved the actresses. The boy is deliberately annoying, and he does annoy me, so I guess he is a success too.On the whole, a waste of time, the feeling of having been cheated, using a deceitful setup for a story that could hold in three lines.I do suggest, instead of watching this movie, reading the Robert Heinlein 1953 short story ""All you zombies"". On the same kind of twisted plot, that gem makes this movie looks... petty."
"This movie tries to emulate a Greek tragedy, which is something expected from a movie based on an Arabic story (for example, Egyptian movies are almost all so dramatic and tragic), but it's a flop. Many will consider it as kind of 'artistic' but it's not really, it's just very poor material. First of all the story is very contrived and the events highly unlikely to happen (probability almost nil). Second, the setting is a deformed and inaccurate account of the Lebanese civil war (they changed names and historic events but the backbone is evidently based on that war and that country). As I've seen in some other reviews, with such a setting so removed from reality, the movie lost its impact, it became a farce. A tragedy or a drama is touching especially because it has elements of reality, and when that reality is removed, the movie resembles a ridiculous science-function-like flick that tries hard to be deep but fails. The acting was generally OK, Mélissa Désormeaux (Jeanne) did a good job, however the actress who played Nawal (the main character) was a disaster; they could have found a better actress, at least someone who could speak proper Arabic."
"Forgive me for being the on person who stood out among the crowd here, but by God I really can't see how this has an 8.2 rating here on IMDb. Now I can see that this would be loved to death by those who only watch ""film"" and not movies, but come on, folks. I do like Denis Villanueve... Or at least I did. I saw his movie Polytechnique and I loved it. It was brutal, uncompromising yet very heartfelt and uplifting. I loved the black and white cinematography, as well as the feeling of being caught in the middle of the shooting. His filmmaking is just lovely in that film. So with hi expectations already in place, I was hoping this would do the good deed.Alright, from a filmmaking standpoint, as in cinematography and all that jazz, the movie is amazing. If I could give the movie a 10 for that alone, I so would. With all the gorgeous scenery and what not, this film really is pleasing to the eye. And the soundtrack is fantastic too, with ""You and whose Army"" by Radiohead over the opening scene- I LOVED that! And the acting is really brilliant, Maxim Gaudette and the female lead both did very great together.But how shallow was this film.The biggest problem is its characterization. Characters go a long way in a film for me, and believe me I wanted to feel for the mother and her children. I'll admit they did quite well with the mother, and the scenes with the flashbacks to her past were very intriguing. But them we went to present day with the kids, and the daughter in her mother's homeland, and suddenly the film goes all to naught because the children are SO DAMNED UNINTERESTING. In fact I don't remember a thing about the son because he was in the movie for like, literally, 5 minutes. Another problem is the script... If there even is one.. The movie feels like Villanueve dropped the script one day, then picked it up and instead of putting the pages in the right order, went ""Ah, never mind, shoot it like this!"" The dialogue is so wooden and hokey, that at times I fell on the ground laughing at the implausibility. In fact scene. After scene, I was scratching my head because the scenes have no meaning. And don't get me started on the twist with the third child, when that came, I asked myself ""was this some bad joke the cast and crew had going on throughout the shoot?""I wish I could jump on the bandwagon like a lot of us here have, but the movie is so dire, tired and dull. And furthermore it's 30 minutes too long too. This is a 90 minute or even a 100 minute movie stretched to 2 hours and 10 minutes. It did not need to be that long.OVERALL: 3/10Pros: A very beautifully shot movie, with great acting and soundtrack.Cons: The film is otherwise very shallow, with an almost zero level script, bad pacing, and dull and shallow characters."
"Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010."
"I'm in a chasmic lost for words. Incendies was...goodness gracious. Villenueve. Villenueve, never leave us. Please. Never, ever leave us. You are a god.Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, okay, I think I'm sturdy now. Incendies is a rare film that manages to be an invigorating political thriller about violence, war, religion, and hostitily, while simultaneously, be a malevolent, nail-biting mystery-noir thriller. There are so many sequences in this bruting, cloak-and-dagger mischief-maker that will stick out to you like an imperishable parasite. It is crushing.The only reason why Incendies doesn't earn a 5/5 from me-for now-is because the pacing at first glance wasn't all too keen at times, there's admittedly a plateful of coincidences that materialize, and the character, Simon, was a bit of a nuisance virtually every time he emerged on screen. I'm sure though that after a rewatch in the near future, I'll end up fine-tuning notably more to this deviously harrowing exploit. Nonetheless, j'ai adoré. (Verdict: A-)"
"I never thought it possible that a film with such heavy subject would have me laughing at the end! But thats exactly what happened. After depicting all the clichés that there are about the wars at the middle East (for most of the time, so efficiently and subtly that the movie went quiet well up to a point), and after having us convinced we are actually seeing a really good movie, it drops a twist so ""over the top "" that instead of delving us in shock, it just leave us there standing like in WTF happened now?MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD......So, the mother had an illegitimate child that was taken away from her (after the killing of her boyfriend by her family) ,who was then captured and trained from an opposite group, who was then later captured and imprisoned from the original group, and then in the blink of an eye changes his loyalties, becomes a tormentor, ends up raping his own mother, and the later, after encountering her son/rapist completely accidentally in the other edge of the world, collapses and dies but arranges to sent her offsprings to find their brother/dad for closure! (which she still loves of course!) Sorry, this is so extreme that it no longer seems horrible or serve us to transmit the dismals of war, it just becomes plainly laughable. If you ever saw a movie that tries so hard to make a point that it TOTALLY misses it, then that movie was it!In the background of course, there are masterfully presented descriptions of the horrors of war, especially civil war, which every nation who has been through this process knows how worst is from ""normal"" wars, but again everything is given with such extremity, crazy coincidences and the like that you can only accept it if you take them for their symbolic meaning. Unfortunately, the end is so extremely absurd that simply ruins the strength of the movie. Everyone knows what happens in wars. Sorry, such crazy development doesn't happen even in them.The saddest part is how many people embraced that movie, showing beyond a doubt how accurate the story about the naked king (H.C. Andersen) still stands today, both among the critics and the common people. But then again, there is no surprise there!In conclusion if you want to see a ""punch in the gut"" about such subjects, see ""Whistleblower"" (or Hotel Rwanda and the like), who truly deliver. This one is betrayed by the fact that it simply tries too much, and hence looses the realism that would give the movie its strength. Oh well, next time..."
"Just watched it, hence the ramble... Such a beautifully-made film with terrific performances. I can see how many people find it an extremely powerful tragedy but I wonder if it tackles too much for its length and medium. There's only so much you can do and say in a 2 hour conventional-ish movie without overtly manipulating the audience.Personally I have a problem with many fictional films of this type though I understand my reaction is not the common one. To me, these films take extremely shocking or despicable events which 'could be real' or 'could have happened' and 'do sometimes happen'. They film these events realistically but they ask the audience to dive in and get into the story as you would a piece of riveting fictional drama, The Godfather etc. At the same time they insist the film has elements of reality or quasi-documentary - to have 'this is almost truthful' or 'this is currently happening' qualities. Yet the screenplay, the unfolding drama, is only as real as a Greek tragedy, say - it is carefully scripted and story-boarded to shock and amuse and provoke. It's a play. A drama. A movie. It's still only another The Godfather or The Matrix. It's not a documentary or a record of an event or events which happened. It's like having your cake and eating it - taking an irony-filled, message-laden 'impactful' stage play and putting it in the package of a realistic contemporary action-drama thriller mystery tragedy. I think if another director had played more on the fictional 'Greek tragedy', 'heightened ironic drama written for the stage' aspects I would have loved it. (Eg if the audience understood they were being manipulated for the sake of great drama.) Conversely I think if this director had made a similar movie based on a true story without the central shocking irony I would have loved it. He's a great director.Not meaning to 'compare' different films and different intentions, and perhaps conflicting some of what I have said so far: I liked the way Roman Polanski's 'Death and the Maiden' keeps the stage play aspects of the original. I didn't enjoy 'The Kite Runner's mixing of fact and fiction, and then its action rescue ending. I'm a fan of some films which take real events and work them into drama and then finish by revealing the actual protagonist in real life - Europa Europa is an example. I'm a fan of City Of God only because it is so obviously a complete fiction, a 'Hollywood' style shoot-em-up, rather than a 'state of address'. I'm a huge fan of Sergei Bodrov's 'Prisoner Of the Mountains' as a film depicting some themes of war and religious conflict in a fairly realistic way but somehow with a nice balance between 'this is just a filmed play' and 'this is something happening right now which carries some universal truths'.I don't comment that often on IMDb but I do think that for films of an extreme nature (such as Incendies' central twist) it is probably worth recording people's different reactions.Finally, I do think the director is one of the best of recent times and congratulate him on the film despite it not being to my taste."
"Incendies was a mixed bag, but I felt like it's negative aspects really bore down on it's positive ones. On the solid side of things, Denis Villeneuve has a real knack for storytelling and an eye for imagery that is truly gorgeous. Some of the shots here dug deep into my brain, be them haunting or beautiful, they managed to elicit a strong reaction from me.The premise of the story is quite an intriguing one -- upon their mother's death, two twins discovery their father is alive and they have a brother they never knew and then set upon a quest to reveal the truth, and in casting the leads I don't think they could have found more skilled actresses than Lubna Azabal and Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin for the job. These women are a rarity in modern cinema; strong and fierce, fully stood in their beliefs and decisions. It's powerful to see such strong women and the actresses portray them with just that level of gusto and perseverance that is required.Where it falls apart though is it's structure. Incendies is another of the many dozen films this year that employ a split-time narrative structure and it's yet another example of how to do it improperly. The sections (detailing the twins journey for the truth against the mother's past and her own journey) never feel like they mesh well and it ends up feeling like two completely separate films. At first it wasn't so bad, but as the film progressed the space between these two grew further and further apart.The last act is where it really derails, as in the present day there are huge discoveries made that we already knew so they lack the sense of emotional catharsis that the characters receive and in the past we see events that the characters already know about so it just becomes a retelling of things we are already aware of. The final act is this bizarrely awkward display of throwing everything at the audience in quick succession, so out of place from a film that had been slowly building up until that point. It felt as though they didn't want it to end up being three hours long so they threw together half a film's worth of information into half an hour. It ends up feeling very awkward and disjointed and completely lost me by the time the credits rolled."
"""Incendies"" is one of these movies that really disappoints - The ones that for a good portion of the movie are highly enthralling, but then comes crashing down. (Major Spoiler) I had an inkling that the filmmakers might pull what they ended up trying to smear on the viewer, and it was so, so disappointing. Suffice it to say to twist the plot around and pretzel it like they did, the filmmakers stooped to utter contrivance. They blew up logic and believability for the sake of sensationalism. How probable could all of this actually take place in such a sequence (?), quite improbable. Additionally I had a hard time understanding what exactly transformed the mother into a killer(?) The ending became marginal and a continuation of the contrivance. Too bad - it had a great story going up until the last quarter of it's run-time."
"Incendies (2010)Scorched is a good translation of the French title. That's how you'll feel by the end.This Canadian movie, based on a play by a Lebanese writer, is set mostly in Jordan and is a tale of a twin brother and sister (son and daughter) looking for their roots after the death of their mother. It's quite amazing.Don't think this is some feel-good flick. What it shows first of all, better than almost any movie I've seen, is the reality of life in wartime in the Mideast (pick your country). The ruthless, bloody, sectarian violence is made intimate in the worst way, or best way cinematically—you hate it, and feel it. This is the huge strength of the movie, giving light to the dilemmas of ordinary people trying to survive, literally, the mayhem.Equally important is how the daughter's view of her mother changes as she learns more and more about her. The daughter is forced to do this because of a request in her mother's will, but she takes it on, in a more recent Jordan, with utter determination.The movie is divided into two time periods. The first belongs to the mother in an ongoing series of harrowing flashbacks. The second belongs to the daughter, and eventually the son, as they look for surviving members of the mother's past. The steely force of will of the daughter turns out to be a mere shadow of the strength of her mother, and you droop in admiration and sympathy for all of them.The huge, dramatic hook of the movie, which you only learn as the characters learn it at the very end of the movie, isn't something I can talk about here. But for outrageousness it puts Shakespeare to shame—and it was for me also a distraction. Your jaw drops and you think, oh how awful (and more)! But a part of my brain was also saying, this is too much, it isn't contributing to the truth and emotional depth of these characters.It might even undermine them slightly, reminding us this is a stage play, an artifice.But that's a nagging quibble. This is really a powerful movie, beautifully rendered, and acted with unusual intensity. It's rough (realistically violent) in a few spots, but it's worth it. Wow."
"Because it's so good, after watching Canadien/French Film Incendies for the second time, I thought that it must be based on a novel of play. I needed to find out. I now know that it is based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad. Mouawad is a Canadien writer, and to my delight, Incendies is part of a series of four plays. This means I have three more Incendies-like plays still to read. I won't go through a run-down of the plot, talk in abstractions about arch, characters symbiosis or lack-there-of. there are tons of proper film reviews out there already dealing with these topics. I thought I'd just talk about two things, the two things that I thought make this an outstanding film: Photography, and the remarkable unfolding of a dramatic story; better film critics than me, which is to say any real film critic, have said that this film pulls off tragedy better than the Greeks. The photography, the photography, the photography was just as good the second time as it was the first time I saw it. The film opens in a village that could be mistaken for Greece of Israel. At thought maybe this was set and shot in Palestine, but I think most of the film as actually shot in Jordan. Theses shots are actually set to portray a fictional Lebanon, both past and modern day. The history intertwined with the movie seems to be loosely fictional; I can't find any information on any of the places that appear in film. My Lebanese civil war history is a little rusty. Anyone else?There are two shots in particular that stand out. Both are shot at a distance to reveal the vastness of the landscape, unmistakably Mediterranean. Rocky, and the trees, not that I'm a tree expert, but they must be olive or fig trees, they are almost overused as prototypical symbols of the Med, but they work great. The first shot I like is actually two shots, meaning one type of shot that is used twice, almost identically. It's of a bus traveling on a skinny, mountainside road. At first, the camera is in close then pans way out to show the whole panoramic view, massive landscape, and tiny bus, a common technique in World films that are shot in exotic landscapes. The other shot is similar. It is later in the film. One of the characters is driving to a modern day Deressa Refugee camp and there is a shot taken from the sky of the winding roads leading up the side of a mountain. This shot is amazing, and whatever effects of filters the photographer added to make it fit the film's tone so well, I can't think of a better word to use to describe them, and the shot as 'cinematic.' I know that's a terrible term to use when describing Cinema, I really do, but a shot like this is so expressive and well-placed in the film, there is nothing going in the film here excepts visuals, the shot on it's own stands out as an artistic, filmmaking achievement.The storyline, the storyline, the storylineunfolds with the precision of a textbook tragedy. It sets up the conflict right off the top--- find missing brother and father. As the drama unfolds the story becomes more and more complex, adding twists and turns to the plot that we never even thought possible. In the end we are left with remains that challenge Oedipus the King in magnitude. (but without the fall from grace) The film still manage to exit the scene with a sparkle of hope. Forgiveness lets the audience breath a little easier as the film closes, a catharsis, but even then the story, the film, will haunt your subconscious for a good while after.

"This is overall a ""nice"" movie with a deep message about wars and a few clever analogies, but it is somewhat too far fetched and unbelievable. Several movies like this one have been made, where a person is torn between two religions or ethnic groups since their birth and confronted to their origins when going on a quest (Greek vs. Turks, Armenian vs. Turks, etc.), but they don't need Radiohead to be entertaining. This movie shouldn't either. I also don't like movies that rely on spectacular coincidences. With everything else, it completely threw me off.Last but not least, the whole mathematical parallel was clumsy and appeared as a sign of ""trying too hard"" to be ""deep"" on too many levels. Anyone having studied maths at university will find the professors' characters (both Lebanese and French/Canadian) unreal. Maybe this worked better when it was a play. One can easily see the classic tragic themes and elements. But I didn't see it then."
"Though a well produced film, the material source is that of propaganda. Do your own research to find out that this film is merely a tool in creating one of the most untrue stories ever told during one of the most difficult times in human history. The author of this story is Muslim and apparently in his story his characters live in an alternate universe were there are no Muslim terrorists instead, a very small minority, namely Christian Maronites are terrorists who cease another's life for out of wedlock pregnancies and are busy running rampant throughout the Middle East committing mass murders.Please check out the Damour Massacre where 582 Maronite Christian civilians were annihilated by Arab/Palestenian refugees residing in Lebanon. These perpetrators, an army of thousands (Muslims including PLO refugees) attacked and killed these Maronite Christians reportedly stating during their attack that they were offering a hollocaust to Muhammad. Nice!I am all for freedom of speech but producing a film based on the writings of such screwed thinking is a jagged pill to swallow. If this is possible perhaps there will be a film in the near future exonerating Hitler and depicting him as some sort of persecuted victim. Well made film are not, some seriously perverse thinking going on here."
"If you like to watch a women who experienced the sickest violence ever  being tortured and raped by her own son in prison, who became a mass  murderer, before raping her for 15 years, this movie is for you. Of  course, the mother sends her two children (the result of this rape) to  look for her father as her last will, just to get them in for a  pleasant surprise. ............ If you think all that sick nonsense  makes an intellectual movie, watch it. If not, stay away. ...........  How this movie can get such great reviews is absolutely beyond me.  Do not watch----"
"Rarely have I been so disappointed by a movie as I have been by 'Incendies'. I've been a member of IMDb for 12 years and most of the time the ratings on here kind of show me whether a movie is good or bad. Not so with 'Incendies'. It is rated 8,3 and is in the top 250, I can not see why that would be so. There is absolutely no depth to any character, no motivation, no background. The problems in some unknown unspecified middle east country are black and white. The only reason why you would make it so is that you do not want to do any research to make the situation believable. But the nail in the coffin was the unbelievable (literally) story. How did the writer get away with such a plot? At least when you read Sophocles you know there is much more to it than just the plot. This was embarrassing, all the more because it is in the top 250.Maybe people don't know what a good movie is anymore, there aren't many made nowadays that make it to most movie theaters. But go to the library people, or some online service. Many great movies have been made with fantastic plot and real characters, with scripts that have been written by adults."
"This film has some strong scenes but it is not close to what it could've been.As someone from Lebanon I couldn't take this film seriously(sometimes the drama bordered comedy for a native of Lebanon).The only fight between Christians and Muslims in the middle east was in Lebanon. But the characters speak different Arabic dialects, the scenery is from Jordan, some scenes hint to real historical facts but are totally off the mark. the parallel's with the war in Lebanon are so obvious yet so wrong.to sum it up. Imagine a film shot in Bresil about a war between confederate states and united states where the dialect is Australian and there's a scene which hint at the Abraham Lincoln assassination... Would you take such a film seriously?"
"Like 'Blue Valentine', the virtues of this movie, its craftsmanship in terms of photography, performance, exposition, and so on, ultimately lead to its undoing. Its absolutely repulsive denouement simply destroys any viewer satisfaction in the whole. This is indeed the spoiler - the brother for whom the twins are searching, and the father, turn out to be the same person - with the added flourish that their conception occurred as the result of torture/rape.What exactly was the point here? Was there one? In 'Chinatown', which has a similar twist, the revelation is treated with horror and disgust (plus it explains eccentricities in the Faye Dunaway character). Here it says absolutely nothing about anything - in fact, the revelation is accompanied by the ludicrous hope of the dead mother that it 'will end the cycle of anger'.Are you kidding? What it's going to do is lead to permanent estrangement and alienation of all three, plus do permanent damage to the twins' self-perception.And what does any of this say about the Middle East? Or any larger human issue? Next to nothing.Disaster. Ugh."
"Having just watched this abomination of a film I felt it my duty to write a review from a Perspective of Sanity !! This Film presents itself initially with Poise grace and soul ... However the twists & turns of the convoluted plot, which appear to promise a truly great finale' Deliver a body Blow of disappointment !!! Sucked in by the emotional trauma of the protagonist, which appear initially Plausible, the credibility of the entire production is neutralised by the most idiotic and ridiculous ""Twist"" at the end as we are finally privy to scripted plot. The Long Lost son, Turned Torturer, Rapes His Mother, (not knowing Who she really is) whilst she is imprisoned (& is the father of her twins !). Only to then turn up half way around the world 20 years later, standing right in front of her at a swimming pool with the one Piece of evidence that would show her his true identity; A tattoo on the Heel of his right foot, placed there at Birth .. Seriously !! What the Hell where you thinking !!! I feel Utterly Insulted !!"
"The first seconds are enough. I mean, they were for me. They are able to capture you. And of course it continues for the whole movie. You know you were blessed with a good film. But I particularly like the way in which this movie begins; I believe this is my favorite part of movies. Hearing Radiohead song ""you and whose army?"" and watching this little boy's sight; the way in which he looks us. Two eyes that are full of anger, passion and pain. These few seconds are the perfect taste of what will be coming up next. A great opening for a great (and tough) movie. A story about family, courage and sacrifice. I recommend this film if you want to get real."
I just wonder what could make me watch the 2 hrs long movie at 3:30 am?.. I don't like the movies regarding the middle eastern wars at all.. That is how I thought before watching this one... I just gave it a chance... And wasn't intending to finish it... Just wondered why this movie has been rated 8.2... It's a quite long movie actually but you don't feel and don't complain while you watch till the end... slow pace is easily adapted and even makes you ask for more...The movie contains many flashbacks which at first looks like a historical review of situation of those days... But then you realize the real mastery in telling the story in front of that strong historical background... The flashbacks and the real time connected by the end of the movie in such way that feels like there's no other way to understand and really ''feel'' the movie...The story itself is not comparable to any other one... at least I haven't watched a movie with such a strong and different scenario... very very powerful movie...This movie deserves applause and all kinds of rewards...I strongly advise this movie to everyone over 16 yrs old... as it is not a ''feel good'' or a ''have fun time with family'' movie... just a very very good piece of art... a master's work...I'm very very happy that I watched it!!!
"I mean what is this movie about? It starts already with a theatrical mysterious will of the mother setting protagonists and us unfortunate viewers on a quest to uncover the MYSTERY. Of course, the quest into the past of the family brings our heroes to what seems like Lebanon and here the second story line starts telling about the HORRIBLE FAMILY PAST during of course the tragic events of the Lebanese civil war. But the second storyline twists and turns and wherever it goes it is just one boring unbearable scene after another. The massacres, the rape, family violence, hatred between the Muslims and Christians,- all this abounds in the movie but what lacks is actually any attempt to look deep into the conflict, to what caused it. Why did Christians and Muslim communities start the war? Who were the actors, who benefited from it, how did this madness happen? I mean, if you decide to touch upon this particular historical event, which is so traumatic for Lebanon, why not actually try to look at it deep, see the different sides, pick up some real drama/ I am sure any documentary about the war is much more satisfying in showing the psychology and the devious mechanism that drives people to start such atrocious conflicts.But instead we are treated to the mind boggling i nits perversity family story that is just so ridiculous and grotesque one can't get anything out of it. I mean, it's gore pure and simple, and is created solely for shock value. There are no nuances here, no real dialogs, no complex interplay of emotions. There is an attempt to say war sucks, but we all know it and there has been a gazillion of better movies on that topic. What we want is something original, fresh, subtle, personal."
"Incendies (Babelfish tells me this means Fires) is good, but a bit formulaic. It aims very high, but I think it falls short of what it could have achieved. I think it spends too much effort on atmosphere and not enough on plot. Maybe tighter editing was needed. Still, I was impressed, and it's undoubtedly one of the better Canadian films, improving on Polytechnique.Early on, there is the reading of a will, and twins are left with the tasks of locating their unknown father and brother.This takes them to ... somewhere in Palestine, which I took to be within Israel. Other reviews have noted this is supposed to be Lebanon, but looks like Jordan. I have no idea. People familiar with the history of the area seem to think that certain facts of the film mean it could not have been in any particular country in the Mid-East, because the places and dates make it impossible. But because the film never claims to be a true story (or I never saw such a claim) I'll forgive it. Still, it would have been more satisfying if it could have been set in a real place and time.From there, the film follows an almost mathematical formula, which itself is an enjoyable mini-theme of the film. One part of the math was ruined by the English subtitles. Euler's (ridiculous) quote actually was ""... (a+b^n)/n=x, hence God exists ..."", which I think was presented on screen as ""... ©, hence God exists..."". I can't tell which version is closer to what was spoken by the character, but I doubt the word ""copyright"" was used. The original quote strikes me as typical of the obfuscation and confusion used to con people into accepting various beliefs. It's nice to see that referenced in this film, particularly given what happens. It's a rare, believable, and complex representation of all-too-common religious violence.I found the film painfully slow at times. While this did serve to accentuate certain scenes which were very effective as a result, halfway through the film I wasn't sure I wanted to watch the rest of it. If I had been at home, I may have turned it off, and I would have missed a good film.I was impressed by the acting, which is to say that I didn't notice it at all. I believed the characters completely. Also, I found the use of sound helped to draw the audience into the story. The silence is silent. Noise is noisy, but in a real way, not Hollywood.I will only half-spoil the ending. For those who don't guess it, they do tell you what's coming, just before it happens. I'll hint at it here, so consider yourself warned.There is a particular question raised by one character, regarding what ""1+1"" equals. This can legitimately be interpreted (in electronics) as an inclusive disjunction rather than addition, giving a correct answer that is not 2. Some might see this as a trick, but I think the film is emphasizing that we should be careful about our assumptions and interpretations."
"I was expecting a lot more especially after all the awards the film has received. I was curiously zoning out in the middle act - the movie wandered about in the desert (literally)and I did not feel engaged by the characters at all.There seems to be some sort of ying-yang morality tale going on judging by the ending, but it lacked real emotional punch. I felt manipulated by the story. This was an extreme situation and maybe it was just too hard to suspend my disbelief. Given the source material, I'm not sure they could have done much.Having re-watched the Hurt Locker the night before I saw this film, I found that the cinematography lacks the clarity and point of view that Kathryn Bigelow's film does. I'm surprised that this film won the Genie award for editing and cinematography - it must have been a slow year in Canadian cinema.I found Villeneuve sliding into some Gus Van Sant territory - deliberately infuriating shot setups meant to imply something greater than whats on the screen."
"This movie isn't intellectual, let alone ""falsely intellectual"", as some claim it to be. This movie is just a powerful message against war, and I'd say against religion, as well. The author cleverly did not place the story into a particular country, cause the story is universal - war over religion makes no sense anywhere. Because religion doesn't make sense either, to start with. Sure, movie has a flaw or two, I'd say the greatest of them is the terrible cast for the role of brother, who couldn't probably act even in his high school, but miraculously ended here.I can't decide if the movie should have more ""pathetic"" and ""emotional"" in it, which could be done just by adding classical music. From the artistic point of view, it's probably needless. However, maybe it would reach more people, ""pathos"" would probably create greater emotional response, and the message would get farther."
"First of all i have to say sorry for my perhaps bad English, but hope that you will understand my meaning anyway.I just saw this film, and im feeling most violated and stained from the experience and added to that a total disappointment.This is a movie that has the potential to be really great. For almost the whole movie i thought this was going to be a story about religion hate violence and in the end that it was going to leave me devastated with sadness but still with a hope that those who believe in love how painful the journey yet may be, it would leave you with the possibility to heal and knowledge about something very important.I would like to write more because im feeling so sadly disappointed, but i will not i just want to warn you going to see this story that it ends with a sick twisted story about a son raping his mother without knowing it and who give birth to twins trying to find out about their history after their mother has died. How could you destroy this movie in times like this when people are trying to understand the violence of terror, with all those people trying to find a lasting understanding about the meaning of life, their are so many people that are suffering from situations in their life and i think that you let them down. This is not a movie this is just a big disappointment."
"The high scoring of this film makes me really lose my faith in human kind as it is a direct reflection of how numb and tolerant people are to mindless, brutal violence. Child murder, mass slaughter, sons raping mothers - who wants to tolerate that sort of barbaric behaviour??? Not only is the storyline so extremely fetched,physically and emotionally violent and so sick and twisted that you can't actually believe what you're watching, but there is a really dangerous religious message to the story too. There are a lot of annoying things about the film too, like where are they? Why do they fight? which time are we in? It keeps going back and forth in time. Why does the son look about 40 when he was meant to be abput 19 and then doesn't recognise the woman he raped systematically? Why are the ""twins"" supremely intelligent being a product of their brother and mother- surely they would have some birth defects being so closely related? Why do none of them age in appearance throughout the film, making it impossible to gauge what's going on? And what on earth is the 1+1=1 about???I pity the person who's troubled mind could even make up such a story..."
"Woohoo! Turns out their brother is also their father! Best twist ending ever!Uh, actually, no.I sat through the first 1.5 hours of this movie, hoping that there'd be some redeeming quality at the end, other than the usual arty farty French (or French Canadian) BS. Wow turns out it's not quite what you expected.For a more authentic and heartwrenching Canadian performance depicting horror and grue, go see instead ""One Lunatic One Icepick"" (warning: parental advisory). It's only about 10 minutes long, compared to 2 hours of this Incendies nonsense.P.S. I sat through the movie thinking how absolutely shitty the twin brother's acting was (the others were OK, but nothing stellar), so my mind was blown when I read Rotten Tomatoes' summary which called the acting ""impressive""."
"""Incendies"" is a movie I really wanted to like. It's refreshing on several levels, featuring pleasantly strange locales (Quebec and Lebanon). It has a good sense of pace, and covers hitherto unseen moments in modern history with a good eye for detail.Still, I was tempted to give this movie the lowest score possible. Primarily for butchering its own story towards the end, going for the type of plot that only amateur screenwriters fall for: exciting on paper but hopelessly shallow in practice. (Go see it for yourself - it's so contrived it completely undermines the realistic feel the director has fought so hard to establish.) Furthermore, I'm sick of movies that create ""drama"" by graphically depicting violence against children. We get that mid-80s Lebanon was a hell hole, Denis. Refrain from using the sledgehammer unless your story absolutely needs it; it will make your movie more intelligent, too."
"The story begins with a will, which Nawal (Lubna Azzabal), a Canadian expat with Middle Eastern origins, leaves behind for twins Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudet). The will consists of two sealed envelopes with instructions for delivery listing Jeanne and Simon's supposedly late father, and their recently discovered older brother. From that point forward, the twins embark upon an adventure in a war-torn country, with the sole purpose of unlocking the mystery left behind by their mother; a mystery providing a gateway to their homeland and origins.The magnificent prologue of the film speaks volumes, with a beautiful, seemingly serene hilly landscape tricking the audience into a false sense of security. The camera then slowly sweeps across a room full of young boys either with clippers shaving their heads to a military standard, or receiving terrifying looking arms. The camera pauses on one boy with piercing eyes, looking at us in a moving combination of fear, anger and resentment as his hair falls on his shoulders, rendering him bald and ready. In the background, Radiohead's 'You and Whose Army' hypnotises us, imprinting the powerful image in our memory – one which will strongly be recalled later on in this film. This scene alone is worth sturdy artistic praise.Face down, naked and without a memorial is the burial instruction left behind by the apparently tortured Nawal, with a haunting quote noting that, ""childhood is a knife in the throat that you can't easily take off"". The children realise that a gravestone can only be added when the puzzles of their mother's past are unlocked with the delivery of the letters within the cryptic will.Based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad,'Scorched' which I am not familiar with, but one could feel tell that the screenplay adaptation turned Mouawad's work into a respected and admired, multi award winning picture. The film garnered international attention, with twenty wins in total at various festivals, including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. 'Incendies' was also one of the most highly praised films screened during the second edition of the Doha Tribeca Film Festival (DTFF), encouraging further exploration into its appeal.Can war be poetic? With Villeneuve, this is possible. It is also romantic and ruthless, combining the most extreme of human emotions, leading to radical choices like the Christian Nawal's recruitment by Muslim militia. The poetic narrative exposes idyllic sceneries that the director focuses on often, revealing shortly after the truths of a raw, harsh and poignant reality. .From the moment Jeanne lands in the Middle East we are transported to stories from her mother's history. Although the country's name is fictional, the historical details fail to belie the nation in question is in fact Lebanon. Every location she visits is alternated with a parallel memory from her mother's past, featuring ferocious battles, both as just a woman and also as a political activist. As soon as Jeanne infiltrates her Nawal's hometown, she is exposed to the complex hatred that society continues to struggle with, even years after the war has ended. The villagers blatantly refuse Jeanne assistance upon discovering she is Nawal's daughter, without any mention of her mother treated like a taboo.While Simon is resisting his mother's enforced wishes, it is Jeanne who initially takes the solo initiative to seek closure. Throughout her adventures, we learn that this same, unfriendly village appears to be the basis of Nawal's struggles upon falling pregnant with a Palestinian man who was brutally murdered by her own brothers. Drowned in the shadow of disgrace by everybody in the village due to falling pregnant, Nawal delivers a boy who is taken away from her upon birth. With a tattoo marking his shin, Nawal had vowed to find her child at any cost, only to be driven out of the village for fear of persecution and even death. This is when she takes drastic decisions out of anger, resentment and fear, just like the boy at the opening of the film.The war is not just the context but explains – regardless of one's political stance – that there's more to what people choose to practice and preach than mere ideals. Nawal's decision to join the militia was primarily born out of despair and the injustices she suffered. In the style of a mythological Greek tragedy, the plot then cleverly reveals key information within every step the twins' detective efforts reaped. After years of absence, it becomes obvious to them that war had never really left all of their mother's past protagonists, but lived on and festered within them.Although the children had considered their mother as nothing more than a neurotic, unstable character, the journey they embark on honours what is in fact a valiant woman, also known as ""the woman who sings"". The past was too painful to be easily forgotten, and it seemed they had never really understood their mother.The film is picturesque, memorable in every scene, surprising, tense and mysterious in parts. Villeneuve portrays a vulnerable and curious vision from Nawal's viewpoint, one that is applicable to any person regardless of religion and political parties, but sharing the same circumstances. For someone who is unaware of the conflict of the Middle East, the narration carries no judgment as to innocence and guilt, or what may be considered right or wrong. As with war in general it is a personal perspective which highlights how one's worst enemy can also be a precious part of oneself. It is the story of struggling women, star-crossed lovers and suffering mothers and the personal journey of a life, and family legend, tainted by war and society."
"Whether or not ""Incendies"" is a good or bad film, one thing that struck me was that for the longest time I had no idea where the film was taking place or the context for the film. I am sure I am not the only one who felt this way watching the move. I thought that perhaps it was taking place in North Africa or Lebanon--I just wasn't sure. A bit later, it became more obvious--but only because I knew a bit about he history of Lebanon and their long and amazingly destructive civil war. Because of this, it really would behoove the viewer to read up on the war BEFORE watching the movie--then it will be a bit easier to follow.The film begins in the French-speaking portion of Canada. Two young adults are at the reading of their mother's will and are in for some surprises. First, their father, despite what they'd been told, is NOT dead. Second, they have a brother! The rest of the film consists of the daughter going in search of these folks and eventually the brother going to Lebanon in search of his sister--who seems to have just disappeared.From this point, the film bounces back and forth from the past to the present day. This can be a bit confusing--you have to really pay attention to keep track. I know that this sort of yo-yo cinema has become more popular in recent years, but I really wish they'd stop doing this and make films in a much more linear fashion. You do learn that the mother's life was hellacious but you also learn that the two children certainly did NOT need to know about their hidden past! I am pretty darn sure I wouldn't want to learn what they learned about this. And, I also predicted this awful truth well before it was divulged in the movie--making it a bit of an icky anti-climax. I thought the film was interesting but also pretty unpleasant from start to finish.By the way, the film is very, very adult--with many adult themes and lots of bloody violence. Now I am NOT saying it was gratuitous--but it's not a film for kids or anyone who doesn't a realistically violent film. Folks getting burned alive or getting shot in the head at close range are among the things you see and, fortunately, the rapes are underplayed but still make this a super-adult film."
"I have not watched something so utterly superficial and falsely intellectual in ages, and I am not really one of those demanding types at all. It goes along well with other moronic attempts such as Jolie's film about the war in Bosnia. This ""masterpiece"" is set in an inexistent land (?), with the political situation and other circumstances resembling to those of Lebanon. The resemblance with the real life stops there. What follows is a chain of unrealistic and senseless occurrences, which aim to shock the viewer, but it is actually going from bad to worse each minute. All in all, this is pathetic attempt to elucidate the sense of human suffering and get an insight in destructive forces within through the portray of society in a spiral of violence. Bad, stupid, boring, and more Hollywood than anything I have seen lately."
"I can understand some of the attraction to 'Incendies,' as there are some well crafted elements of the film, including beautiful cinematography, superb acting, and a story that immediately draws the viewer into the world of its troubled characters. But what I find inexplicable, as well as frightening, is how so many people who have seen 'Incendies' appear incapable of seeing it for what it is, i.e., a Muslim propaganda film. While the protagonist of the story is an Arab Christian, her character clearly serves no other purpose than as a medium for illustrating completely unprovoked evils of her own people against the Muslims, who are all portrayed in this film as the most perfectly innocent victims one could possibly imagine. It is worth noting that the lead actress in Incendies also played a major role in 'Paradise Now,' a Palestinian film in which it is the Jews who are portrayed as the unprovoked tormentors of the Muslim people. While there have in fact been incidents of violence against Muslims by non-Muslims, there is a long and indisputable history of Muslims committing acts of violence upon not only non-Muslims but each other. And while I've seen much passion, beauty and poetry in films written by Muslims, I have unfortunately never seen a single one that even attempts to show any sympathy whatsoever with non-Muslims or that places any responsibility whatsoever upon the Muslim people for any kind of problem facing them. But equally disheartening is how many people--including some of those who are the objects of the lopsided demonization portrayed in so many Muslim-made films--subscribe to such blatant hatred and lies."
"Don't believe all the very good reviews. I guess this movie was given extra credit because: it is a ""author"" movie, and it is about a harsh Arab tragedy.The story and actors are not bad. The cut of the movie is.The director needs to cut its movie so the story can really flow. In Incendies many scenes are long with unnecessary still picture, or traveling.The ""Author"" would say you need time to convey a story with feelings. BS. With a normal speed the story would have had more strength, and avoided boredom."
"I have been hit by a truck........ by the movie ¨ Incendies ¨.The best, most absorbing & emotionally enthralling movie I have ever witnessed. ( In my 34 yrs ) Am profoundly & unutterably moved.Affected.Right to the very Essence of my Being.Am speechless. Overwhelmed.Shaken.To the my C O R E.Made me cry.Never a film has smashed my heart to countless pieces. Am so serious & somber.... no joke can make me laugh.Will never be the same person.Am a walking cadaver. Dead, yet still alive.I am less my body now. More my Spirit.I honestly feel my Soul has AWAKENED.Maybe I can be happy & have happiness.Perhaps.But I don't care for happiness .... any longer.Means nothing.After ¨ Incendies ¨ ate & ravaged my heart."
"Incendies is quite an extraordinary film. Whilst I did find myself with wondering thoughts at the start, it tapers off into something that is so engaging and riveting that you just begin to flow with it. Possibly one of the best films I've seen from French-Canada, this film may very well blow your mind.Incendies offers a new twist and turn every chapter up until the end. It is very hard once you get started to take your eyes off of the captivating sequences that are held before you. Not only does this film do a good job at storytelling, it also holds incredibly well as a commentary of war, religion and family."
"A film with 8,1/10 (36000 votes) on IMDb should be an instant classic, a masterpiece of cinema, a film you will remember for the rest of your life...or so you would think. Well, no. There is a 'twist' in the story that you could say is cleverly written, it does not make up for the other defects of the film. It's slow, with the character going though to motions of their 'discovery', but none of that makes for interesting scenes. I didn't care much for the characters and certainly failed to identify or sympathize with them (a basic requirement for liking a film). The story takes place in an unidentified Middle-Eastern country (apparently they didn't want to offend any middle eastern people or they think it's all the same over there -whatever) and religion is (surprise, surprise) basically the root cause of all the evil that happens to our protagonist. The sum of all these elements does not add up to a great film. I even turned it off after 35 mins. After a few days I gathered enough courage to plow through the remainder of this film, and it does get a bit better after the slow start. My advice is: there are films you'd think are perfect but there's always such a thing as personal taste."
"For the last 2 years i was saying to myself ""you should see Incendies that everybody is talking about, it must be awesome"" and i finally did...The goods: great actors, great cinematography, some strong dramatic scenes, sometimes very realistic. The bads: Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong, way to long, especially the beginning of the film. I didn't care about the characters and i've found myself fighting against boredom for the most part. Nothing really happens until the 48th minute, THE 48TH MINUTE!! I didn't bought the plot in the first place; a twin's odyssey in the middle-east to meet an unknown brother and understand the mystery behind the mental illness of their dead mother; and that's too bad because i wanted to like this movie very hard, but i didn't. The ending is twisted at a point it became ridicule and laughable, i didn't bought that either... Yeah, i know, truth is stranger than fiction, but sometimes fiction pushed too hard is overkill.In my opinion the music didn't fit for a middle-east movie, for the most part at least. I mean, why not include some Twisted Sisters, Bon Jovi and Justin Beiber in the soundtrack once you are there? A bit of ""phrygian dominant"" would have helped.I didn't liked the structure either, i think they tried to make it too ""artistical"" or something, and it didn't helped the story.If you want your vacation to last longer, that 2 hours and 10 minutes felt like 5 hours, just saying...Not a bad movie, but not that great either. A lot of bones but a lack of meat. Maybe i had too much expectations but in one word : deception."
"The story dreadfully drags on for a good hour at a false rhythm favourable to boredom, the plot then accelerates in the last 35-40 minutes, but unfortunately this regain of interest is completely annihilated by the highly improbable aspect of the outcome.The narrative structure therefore turns out very blurry and this feeling is emphasized by a very confused editing alternating past and present, for example you get the mother and the daughter mixed up, especially at the beginning, because they resemble too much, and the temporal referential isn't very clear so you never now which period it is or how much time has passed.Moreover, and more importantly, nothing is explained regarding the historical context in Lebanon during the 70's, we're offered raw data that isn't supported and unless you're aware of this civil war episode, the movie tells nothing on that subject even though it occupies a primordial place in the story.Therefore, it's hard to understand the enthusiasm for Incendies and the raving critics it arouse since the content is so weak and hardly compensated by a rather catchy photography and seamless direction."
"As two teenage siblings are making the funeral arrangements for their prematurely deceased mother, their faithful notary informs them of a very peculiar request that she has left to be completed before her burial. Her children are suddenly told that they have a brother and a father who are still living, and that they are to deliver a secret letter to each of them on her behalf. This situation is succinctly communicated in a very effective opening scene of exposition, and indeed the difficult search of these young adults to find their lost relatives remains the central focus throughout the entire film. A niggling weak point of many critically-acclaimed European films is a frustrating ambiguity in storytelling and a lack of a properly paced narrative, both of which seem to have a certain sadistic purpose about them, as if the intention is to make things as hard for the audience to follow as possible. However, the early firm grounding of plot present here assists greatly with the accessibility, and so is far less discriminative.The scenes making up the body of the piece proceed mostly with a masterful grace, coherence, intrigue and sophistication. The sister, Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) is by far the more willing of the two to carry out their mother's dying wishes – her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette) merely responds with a moody male temper to the words in the will – and so, at least initially, we follow Jeanne, being shown extended flashbacks of the events from her mother's past that she discovers. In these scenes, we see Mrs Nawal Marwan fighting endlessly to survive in a world fraught with terror and violence, being the horrific religious and political conflicts in the Middle East of the 1970s. The challenges she faces make this one of those remarkably engrossing and poignant stories of hope bravery and love that are cinematic gold.The final discoveries and revelations are again satisfyingly comprehensible, but definitely not for the faint-hearted viewer. Still, even if one finds the overall conclusion distastefully grotesque, there is still something to admire in the most apt direction from Denis Villeneuve and a splendid performance from Lubna Azabal as the mother. With a cast that also includes Rémy Girard, Allen Altman, Mohamed Majd and Abdelghafour Elaaziz, Incendies (""Scorched"") may have the occasional patch of sluggishness and over-exaggeration, but you still owe it to yourself to see it."
"A great movie that is almost disturbing, with an excellent photography, direction, acting, and specially the writing, for a moment it could be a little ''slow'' but it doesn't matter because the end it's really well builded. This is the best example of how to make a quite shocking movie with almost no blood, and no graphic scenes, just a great story"
"This film begins with a simple and captivating concept- a Mother dies, leaving some strange requests in her will about finding a lost brother and Father, which her twin son and daughter were not aware existed.
From the very first scene you can't help but be pulled in by the mystery behind the past of this woman. Through a series of flashbacks involving the Mother, we learn about her dark past as the twins try to unravel this last request their Mother left them.
This film is defiantly one of Denis' more dark and serious films. A lot like the film 'Prisoners' Denis would go on to make in 2013, Incendies is about the love that a parent has for her children, and the lengths she will go to protect them. Visually, this film is very saturated in shots of war zones, turmoil and Iranian landscapes. Each tense scene that takes place within Iran is as shocking and new for the audience as it is for the children. Obviously, with this being one of Denis' first films, he has a passion for making sound a big part of his films, as he displays in later films like Arrival, Blade Runner and Sicario. Every threatening sound comes across as quite jarring and real, only adding to the incredible sense of hostility he builds between the main characters and the antagonists. The biggest thing I can appreciate about this film is the way Denis does not underestimate or patronise his audience. He very carefully feeds you segments of the narrative so you can fully build it up in your head, but does not make it stupidly obvious. This is also his most political film, and although you don't need to know much about the conflicts in Iran in the 70s, it really adds to the depth and tone of the story, complimenting it very nicely. There were plenty of moments throughout this film that left me shocked and in awe at how visceral and surprising they were. So far, I haven't seen a Denis Villeneuve film that I haven't appreciated in one form or another, and he will definitely go down as one of the great directors in modern cinema history."
"I'm in awe. This was so powerful. I still am very emotional after finishing this. It's heartbreaking, yet hopeful. The cinematography was sensational. There was a rawness to this movie rarely experienced for me. The sheer emotional horror of some scenes are delicately balanced out with hope and joy in another scene. This film portrays the setting in all its destruction and beauty very well. It flows well between the present and the flashbacks throughout. This is a great mystery movie, but it is so much more. This movie is one I won't be soon to forget."
"This movie needs more recognition i couldn't believe it was released in 2010 it is that kind of movie which will stick until you die do watch this movie with little patience every aspect of the movie is masterpiece i.e cinematography,editing,screenplay,music,direction,performance this is the only movie i consider best after the shawshank redemption and it deals with somewhat same thing i.e.hope just watch this movie and get prepared to be amazed"
"Blown away by this one. Grown twins are tasked by their late mom, as part of her will, to track down their real father and their heretofore-unknown older brother. The trail leads to an unnamed Middle Eastern country. Early Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) is just masterful; I particularly loved the technique of focusing on a character's face as they experience what is happening around them. Doing so gives us a chance to read their emotions of the moment. Strong acting, and a twist ending that I for sure never saw coming."
"Don't miss this great movie. A very tragic story about war. The story-line is a little slow, but you should wait to the end of it. Some nice movies aren't famous, this is one of them."
"This, for me, is Oedipus Rex (by Sophocles) in movies. One of the best by Dennis. The plot and story resembles to Oedipus Rex, and a great story has revived by the hands of Dennis."
"There is a stark beauty to this film - as with other Villanueva films (Prisoner, Enemy, Sicario), the mundane and the curious alike are framed like realist paintings. It's quietly mathematical in its story-building, reaching a solution to its equation that is, well, both the only answer that makes sense as well as the most incomprehensible. The performances by both lead women are a revelation. This movie is now 8, going on 9, years old - but like a Hitchcock, fails to age because of its mastery in showing and telling."
"Though sometimes it seems as though information is given to us slightly too early, this often leads to some decent dramatic irony and does 'distract' from - and thereby make all the more impactful - the flick's big, blindsiding final reveal which is essentially as shocking as it is sickening, a harrowing revelation for both the audience and the picture's principle characters that has massive repercussions for both, and serves to recontextualise everything that came before it in a significant yet suitably subtle way, mostly making up for the slightly slow pace and occasional meandering that had marred the piece before. Once you've settled into the strange pace and presentation of 'Incendies (2010)', you're treated to an increasingly dark exploration of a woman you know to be dead, whom is still as strong a presence as any other character, and the children who slowly learn about her life alongside us, as we both inch ever closer to an ending that will haunt our memories for days, a tragedy of Greek proportions set against a backdrop of tragedies that all meet that same standard. As each new revelation ratchets up the suspense and plumets us in to increasingly dire territory, an unexpectedly grim realism begins to perforate the entire piece, steeping it in an often unspoken sadness and a thick air of mystery. It's this that gets under your skin and pulls you in deeper, never letting you go until the last frame finally lets you slump back in your seat and release all your emotions in one gut-wrenched gasp. It's an ever-escalating devestation of our expectations. It isn't darkness for darkness sake, rather an exploration of the characters within these situations. It's also the rare film that rests upon withholding information that would seem fairly simple, yet doing so for legitimate narrative reasons, and providing it in intelligent, usually exposition-light ways. While the tragedy exists for a reason, it is indeed tragedy. Blindsiding, unflinching tragedy, at that. The film knows when to show and when not to. All in the aid of making each moment the most impactful it can be, making you feel like you are the child of this poorly-treated, mysterious mother as you learn of her past. You'll often find yourself asking: how can things get worse? Trust me... they do. It's brilliant. 8/10"
"One of the movies that makes you realize the reality of the world through a journey about war, love, oppression and human evilness and weakness. 
I was captured by the movie's surprises and plot twist, along with the sad realities that it presents. still it depicts human reality more than ever, behind the cells, beyond country borders, and beyond humans themselves.
highly recommended"
"Excellent storytelling and early feature film by Denis Villeneuve , renown for reinvigorating the mystery/thriller genre (Enemy, Prisoners, Arrival) .. Incendies was an early first before his bigger hollywood budgets
----------------------------
Story follows two directions, one past one present, of two twins tracking their mother's footsteps to uncover the mysteries of her past. The twins of a dying mother are given two tasks to fulfill before they bury her in a ""tradition grave"": to find their father and brother. They believe their father has died in the religious wars waging during their mother's time, but the notary suggest they to search deeper. The son holds resentment in his heart, but the daughter wants to complete her mother's wish and learn about her family history. This leads her on an adventure through the middle east as she tracks various stomping grounds of her mother (including childhood village, university, prison) hoping to find the whereabouts of her father and brother. The secrets to their identities are shocking disturbing.Meanwhile the story transitions into the past of their mother's life: her love for a muslim refugee, the politics of religious warfare in the area, the search and discovery of her adopted son, and all the various people who's heart she touched during her lifetime.
Early masterpiece from the legend Denis Villeneuve, bravo"
"This is a beautiful film. The direction is perfect; the score poignant and edgy at times when it needs to be. The cast all gave the performances of their careers. The cinematography is second to none with the shots beautifully done to draw you into this, at times, horrific story.But it is the story that makes this film superb. All of the characters are real. You feel with them through all of the beats and the dialogue is really well thought out. This is especially true with all the use of dramatic irony through the use of multiple languages.A must watch but not for the faint hearted."
"I don't know if I've ever seen a more heartbreaking and shocking story. Check that, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was another film that served a solid punch to the gut that remains with you a long time. I have to credit some other reviewers for this film to identify the location of the story and place it in context of the Lebanese civil war. I might have considered it myself if I hadn't been so absorbed by the story and the intricately detailed revelations regarding Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) and her twins, son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin). One must pay attention though, to the non-linear story telling style of director Denis Villeneuve, as well as the identity of the Christian and Muslim factions involved in war time brutality and atrocity. Apart from the principal story, the scene that will stay with you for a long time involves a Christian militia attack on a busload of Muslims attempting to flee their war torn and devastated city. A noble sacrifice on Marwan's part turns into a horror spectacle when a young child is gunned down by the militants. The picture exemplifies the terror of war and it's heartbreaking effect on those fortunate to survive."
"Not what you ""believe"", but what is believable. Eternal truth - our ability for good AND evil. If you want to see this in 4D (such thing must exist)- see also Waltz with Bashir.The most important part is - the life being so much more bizarre than fantasy.This film shakes you up to the core. Whether this is a ""true story"" or not literally makes no difference. It is a metaphor on ANY hateful relational process, but especially on so called ""religious"" confrontations.Take facial tissue and don't be embarrassed by your tears."

Got completely tricked by 8.2 IMDb rating and can't believe I watched it until the end. Stay away!This will be a short review, since I've lost enough time already watching this awful movie.

"The beginning was marvelous. You could tell this came from a play, because the weight of everything hung from words alone - the incredible malediction the mother pronounced on herself, and the contrasting reaction of the two children. Now that I think of it, there are elements of a fairytale in that beginning, present in the task set before the children much as Aladdin is sent for the lamp or Cinderella to clean, and this may - if not justify - provide insight to the structural failures further on; but, as I said, the latter half of the film is a disappointment.""Incendies"" is about a brother and sister, twins, who are sent by their mother via her will to search for their father and their brother. This journey reveals, via flashback, the mother's ordeal in an unnamed Arab conflict (Christianity vs Muslim, as usual), and is capped by the revelation that the father and brother are the same person. War is so horrible that it causes even this sort of thing to happen, but whereas the mother can't survive this last atrocity (the realization makes her literally will herself to die), her children can live on.The message, as it were, is all well and good, but the film as a work of art that clarifies life by being an artifice doesn't work for me. It's not that characterization in itself is missing: the children are flat (flatter, at least, than Nawal, who isn't exactly a masterpiece of characterization), and that's kind of an empty promise on the life after war, isn't it? Aren't they just two springboards that serve, in the story, solely to dig up the past? Towards the end, characters such as the lawyer are mobilized like chess pieces, and we find out that Nawal was almost a mythic figure in the jail, ""The Woman Who Sings"" -- some sort of superhero. Things fit together too well, a bit like Nawal's outfit, with her rather stylish jeans and jacket; indeed, the revelation at the end, with the silly bit of dialogue from the brother (""One and one... how can they make one??""), couldn't transcend its tawdriness. It's like Disney meets Oedipus Rex.The movie was still entertaining and had moments, of course, of grandeur. But ultimately disappointing. Glad I saw it on the plane."
"I'm meant to provide at least ten lines according to IMDb - Yet this film only needs one word, 'Profound' - I could use a thousand and still not describe this MONUMENT of a film ......let's try.....engaging, hypnotic, beautiful, deep, shocking, chilling, honest, disturbing, emotional, original, soul destroying, uplifting, tear invoking, truly 'human'. No 'spoilers',or 'clever clichés' are needed ( I don't think there's a single cliché in the whole two hours) - I've waited a long time for a film like this - After writing the effect it had; just to get my thoughts down while still fresh, I'm going straight to my best mate and fellow film lover's house with a glorious yet modest DVD case and demand he watch it - ""right now, Dave, right now! Put that kettle down, your coffee will go cold anyway, JUST WATCH THIS!!!"" - And I know he'll thank me for my obstinate insistence. Thirst will mean nothing, the 'bathroom'? You'll learn to hang on, hunger? It won't occur. Very rarely will you encounter such a masterful telling of a story, trust me - yet don't allow anything to distract you, and when you think ""the subtitles aren't working"", you're not meant to understand.....it's from the main character's perspective and they don't speak Arabic either, a clever touch that you'll learn to get. Monsieur Villenueve, if I ever win the lottery and write the script that's in my head - YOU will direct it after rewriting it. I'll pay you anything and give you free reign - pure Dogme with subtleties of touch and inflection that very few of us will ever have but can only dream of thinking once in our lives. IF THE Oscars WEREN'T SO 'EXCLUSIVELY ANGLO' AND INCLUDED FOREIGN FILMS FOR BEST PICTURE ETC - THIS WOULD HAVE WON A HALF A DOZEN. Bravo, again, Msr Villenueve, BRAVO!!!!! Wajdi Mouawad - you gave us this play from your heart - I hope it's not you're own life story - if so......go with God, peace brother."
"this film is not for the faint of heart. the film contains a great deal violence. this is NOT make believe movie violence. this REAL fear inducing violence.the back drop of the film is the Lebanese civil war & its sectarian divisions. The opening sequence, the reading of a will, contains burial instructions, instructions that will haunt me the rest of my life.the acting is great: very real. the script is exceptional: very believable. great use of sound. great plotting.I love films that take me from my safe world & thrust me into worlds that I don't know & fear. I am very disappointed that this film did not win the Academy Award for best foreign language film.this film was VERY deserving of the award."
"This Canadian production that made it to the Oscar short list for foreign language category (French, for this particular one) has been widely acclaimed in film reviews in the two largest Canadian cities. It has been described in various ways as family drama, detective thriller and war atrocities. One mention that nobody omits is ""Greek tragedy"". To those who have some familiarity with this term, the mere mention may well be a spoiler, albeit perhaps not a completely conspicuous one. One, at least, compares this movie to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's works (""Amores perros"", ""21 grams"", ""Babel"") which I think is carrying it too far. A much more appropriate comparison is ""Possession"".Like ""Possession"", this movie is structured along two time lines. In the present, a pair of grown-up twins tries to track down the past history of their recently deceased mother by journeying to a Middle East country (unspecified but quite obviously modelled after Lebanon). Running parallel is what happened two decades ago, revealing gradually the atrocities the mother had endured. Geographically, the two parallel narrations track the same itinerary. This is exactly the structure of ""Possession"" although in the latter, the time gap is a few centuries and the protagonists in the two sequences are not blood-related.The plot is not complicated so I won't even go any further into details other than stating that the whole thing is started by a somewhat strange will of the mother. While the detective-suspense pull is indisputable, it would be going too far to call it a thriller. One thing to remember is that the original material is a stage play. While the movie makers have done a great job in translating stage experience into cinematic experience, the essence of the movie is still its thought-provoking quality. Here, different people may tune in to different aspects. Some would react strongly to the aforementioned Greek Tragedy element, through the deep anguish of the mother. Others, taking a more contemporary angle, see the abhorrence of war, twisting and warping human nature.Having said that, I must compliment the movie makers on the arresting cinematic visual accomplishment in the movie. The desolate nature of some of the Jordanian (the filming location) landscape helps, but there is more. One frame that particularly registers is a burning bus (terrorists' doing) which is placed towards the left a little back at medium distance. The ominously dark column of smoke seems to have taken on a life of its own, a hideous, menacing serpent advancing to the front right of the screen. With compositions like this, who needs pathetically useless and senseless 3D. In the audio department, Radiohead's music has been deftly integrated into the heart-wrenching context of the movie.The performance of Belgian actress Lubna Azabal as the mother in this movie has been so widely acclaimed that there is really nothing more that anybody can add. One critic offers ""intensely soulful"", a good summing up."
"'Incendies' is the film that put director Denis Villeneuve on the map. Now, with 'Prisoners', 'Enemy', and 'Sicario' under his belt Villeneuve has become one the more eye catching directors working today. Just like his other films 'Incendies' strings together a cobweb like story. We watch as a pair of twins venture out to the middle east in search of their father and brother, as a final wish of their recently departed mother. Although the film is more about these twins finding out who their mother was. Naturally this not all that the film is about but, to avoid heavy spoilers and to keep this film as the experience it should be, I will leave it at that.And this film is an experience. Even though the film runs at a fairly long two hour and twenty minute run time, what 'Incendies' accomplishes in that time is remarkable. It is able to draw you in and hold your attention for its entire run time. Its story is unlike anything you will ever see. It's a slow burning thriller that hits every beat that you'd expect and every beat that you don't expect. And it does it in such a way that everything feels completely natural and progressive. The control that Villeneuve has over the film is insane. Every single person involved in front and behind of the camera does a superb job. Villeneuve knows what he wants out of the film and gets exactly that.It's a beautiful film that is able to manipulate its audience with utter ease. Its not just a beautifully constructed film but a beautiful film to look at too. It may not be Roger Deakins who shot 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' but 'Incendies' seems to take note of this gritty realistic look. And it employs this same style here. And just like his other films 'Incendies' has an ending that will knock you flat. This ending would not be near as effective if where in anyone else's hands. It cuts between flashbacks and reality in such a way that keeps the film from becoming predictable. So, when the film concludes it comes as a complete shock. I could go on and on about how miraculous this film is. But I think I should just leave it here. If you have any desire at all to see this film please go out and purchase it. If you do, I assure you that 'Incendies' is a film that you will never forget. It's a beautifully constructed film with enough style to keep just about any body interested."
"Were it not for the fact that the plot is tied in too neat a bow at the very end, ""Incendies"" would be a perfect movie. Told in both the present and the past, the film traces the efforts of twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) to carry out the wish of their dead mother (Lubna Araval) to find and deliver letters to their father and lost brother. The twins go to Lebanon -- Jeanne with conviction, Simon reluctantly. They don't quite know where to begin. The brother, their mother's illegitimate son, was sent to an orphanage. That much is quickly established. But from there on, the film follows the search and also plays back the events in the Lebanese Civil War which separated their mother from her child and from the father or the twins. Once the search was fully under way, this viewer was initially bit confused as to which parts were present and which parts were past because Ms. Desormeaux-Poulin looks at times much like Ms. Araval, so I didn't always know whether I was witnessing the search by the daughter or the war time travails of the mother. It's a minor problem because, soon enough, the two elements -- the search and the war -- diverge and the context identifies daughter and mother. The two women each handle their roles superbly. Simon is a necessary player but M. Gaudette is no more than adequate in the role, which is, in any event, subsidiary to that of mother and daughter.I won't reveal the ending. However, the war time scenes are depicted with convincing brutality, and the indifference to suffering that characterized the Lebanese Civil War is as appalling on film as it might have been if one had actually been there when it happened. In addition, the cameras are focused on the bleak landscape outside the villages and towns, which adds to the sense that this is as close to real life as it is possible to get.As suggested in the beginning of this review, I found the ending too pat and much too convenient, but it is certainly dramatic -- and others may find it more convincing than I did."
"If you liked Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns, this is the film for you -- it's very slow, with lingering shots of unimportant symbols, mentions moralist truisms at the end that have nothing to do with the movie, highlights desolate scenery, features endless graphic gore, turns on revenge, and celebrates stone-faced acting.Plus, in the film, women are good and men are bad. In Lebanon, Palestinian refugee camps were good and Christians were amorally ethnocentric in trying to uphold traditional values. War is bad, except when it is the topic of a film, in which case it leads to self-discovery, which is good."
