"At the end of the day the films you give top marks are those films that become constant companions. You can see them again at the drop of a hat, you show them to people who have never see them and it's always a triumph. ""Witness For The Prosecution"" is one of those wonders. Suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy this banquet of a romp. Charles Laughton showed here what he was made of better, more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films, at least the moments with him in it, are unforgettable - Captain Blight or Henry VIII, Quasimodo or that malefic Senator from South Carolina. Here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it's such an incredible fun to watch him do it. Tyrone Power is a toy in his hands but not Marlene Dietrich who stands her ground, not merely as a character but as a presence on the screen. Billy Wilder visits early Hitchcock territory with wit and fun. Elsa Lanchester's nurse is the cherry on top of this delightful film."
"Charlie Chaplin was funny. Charles Laughton was witty. As good as 'Witness For The Prosecution' is---Agatha Christie's story, the other actors, the technical expertise---the Oscar-nominated Laughton is THE reason to see this film. What he brings to Billy Wilder's 1957 courtroom thriller is his tremendous wit and intellect. It's a serious story, but the dark-comic tag team of Wilder/Laughton upgraded the film from ""a good courtroom mystery"" to ""a classic of the courtroom genre"".The headlining star, Tyrone Power, sure doesn't help them very much. He plays anguish about as smoothly as ripped sandpaper...and anguish is the unfortunate emotion he's got to play for most of the picture. Power has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. His wife (Marlene Dietrich) seems to be doing all she can to sell him out, appearing as...drum roll, please, drummer man...the star witness for the prosecution. Laughton is the brilliant (and ailing) English barrister defending Power. The plot twists 'n' turns a dozen ways from Sunday, just as it always does in Christie's best work.Amongst all the talk of bloody murder, there are running gags about cigars and alcohol. More dark wit---Laughton's character's poor health might cause him to drop dead at any moment. Wilder weaved thrills and smiles as well as any director. In this, he was wise to anchor the supporting cast with mainstays of the stiff upper lip. John Williams and Ian Wolfe (Hirsch from ""WKRP""), not to mention Laughton's control-freak assistant Elsa Lanchester (who was also CL's real-life wife), are bloody good.Movies of this type have been ripped off so often that students of the ""don't give away the ending"" class are bound to figure it out. I did. That hardly mattered because there were STILL more surprises to come. Through all that plot, Dietrich winds up being the most fascinating character. Project back and you'll realize how well her performance works. But she & Power are merely the star attractions in 'Witness For The Prosecution'. The main dish is Charles Laughton. Considering how ironic and cynical our society has become, it's stunning that brilliant old pros like Wilder and Laughton aren't more popular today. After this movie, they've become personal heroes of mine."
"Billy Wilder is a director with an understanding of cinema that is almost unmatched throughout the medium's entire history - that's why his films are always so good. Witness for the Prosecution is yet another highlight in the great director's history, and it proves that courtroom dramas can be both riveting and a great opportunity for some first rate comedy. Wilder's film features one of the most well paced plots I've ever seen in a film, and it's a plot that includes some very finely tuned twists. Towards the end, Wilder bombards us with twist after twist, each one both making sense and topping the one before it. In a time when people are impressed by films such as 'The Sixth Sense', Billy Wilder still shows us how to skilfully attribute a twist into a film's plot. The plot itself follows the story of Sir Wilfrid Robarts; an ace defence lawyer that has been told that his health won't allow him to tackle anything more than mundane cases, but is brought back into the fray when a case involving the murder of an elderly woman comes into his hands. Wilfrid must now juggle the case and his health as he attempts to keep the young man from being sent down.Like all Wilder films, this one is a very pleasurable viewing. Wilder manages to find a middle ground between substance and entertainment, and so this is a film that will please fans of both aspects. The film is deliriously entertaining throughout, with some truly great lines of dialogue (most of which is very quotable) and every twist adds a new level to the story. The substance comes from a multitude of angles, and themes of love, health, sacrifice and most notably, justice, are all more than prevalent. The acting is certainly of note in Witness for the Prosecution. Charles Laughton is absolutely sublime as the undermining and stubborn Wilfrid Robarts; his performance is very strong, and makes up the backbone of the film. The main supporting performance comes from Marlene Dietrich. I'm not a big fan of hers; despite having a great pair of legs, she just doesn't do anything for me, but in this film she brings sufficient coldness to her character and really makes it her own. The final main performance comes from Tyrone Power; he isn't as great as the other two, but does enough with his character to ensure he's believable. Highly recommended viewing!"
"A film I have not seen for years but will always remember with fondness. A classic thriller with all the right ingredients - Power and Dietrich are spectacular, and, by early standards (and recent ones!), the twist is excellent. Charles Laughton however, provides us with a glib chuckle as the aging defense attorney ruled by his overlord maid. A distraction that only adds to an excellent plot line.I can't imagine another film of the genre and the era, that so wickedly entangles the essential thriller with a 'crime of passion' (oops, spot the plot killer...) gem. A classic. A film for true movie lovers. Take it from me!"
"To see ""Witness for the Prosecution"" for the first time in 2008 is a jolting surprise. Nobody could do it better than Billy Wilder did in 1957. A man accused of murder, Tyrone Power, the weakest link in this terrific chain. Sir Wilfred is called to defend him, he is played by the extraordinary Charles Laughton, but he's just out of hospital - he wasn't dismissed he was expelled - and due to doctor's orders he's not to take any criminal cases. He finds Power charming and personable enough but he's not going to risk his life to save his until Marlene Dietrich makes her entrance - and what an entrance! How marvelous that what amounts to a bit of Agatha Christie's usual fare becomes such an entertaining and at times right down riveting piece of film-making."
"In a recent biography of Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen. I can't praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.Tyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden. She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate. When she's murdered, Scotland Yard arrests Power.Power's solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton. Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case. Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor's advice.The original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957, but lost to Alec Guinness. Marlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She's a war bride over from Germany and she's got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself, but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration, the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.The Anglo-Saxon legal system's goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution."
"Another brilliant work in the legendary career of Billy Wilder. The director signs a cinematic adaptation of this Agatha Christie story: actually it is really as if the camera went on stage for filming the play. But the film is passionating and exciting, there's no time to get bored.Another thing we shall not forget is that Billy Wilder is European. He manages to keep the spirit of the film very British, with lots of humour and sarcasm. Compared to films like this one, ""legal"" movies from John Grisham's novels are empty and meaningless, without soul.Mr.Wilder is the director, we know; we have Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich: what a cast! Add a superb black and white cinematography... The result is amazing, with a film where dialogues are flawless and carry everything.Times are different now, but the atmosphere and the taste of movies like this one are impossible to find in contemporary films."
"This is one of the best ""trial movies"" ever made. It's an outstanding film that is just as good today as it was almost 50 years ago when it was released in the theaters. The shocking ending caused quite a stir back then, too.The only part of the movie I thought looked dated and unrealistic was Tyrone Power's character being able to interrupt the trial with outbursts and not be reprimanded for it. There is no way that would be tolerated, at least today.Otherwise, it's a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain: Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton, who plays Power's defense attorney, grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power's wife. Laughton's dialog is terrific throughout, bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He's just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn't have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester, playing Laughton's nurse. She, too, demonstrates her comedic talent and significantly adds to the fun of watching this film.If you like some fine drama, storyline twists, a little humor thrown in and great acting and dialog, this is a classic film to check out."
"Witness for the Prosecution is, as IMDb voters cann attest, a great movie. A clever, character-driven courtroom drama, it deserved the Academy Award nominations that it received in 1958, and it has justly endured to the present day. Starring the terrific talents of Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power, and particularly Marlene Dietrich, directed by Billy Wilder, and based on the superb short story by Agatha Christie, it is a combination has all of the very best ingredients, and delivers a nearly outstanding film.The movie centers around Laughton's character, an aged, feisty, and very canny English barrister (lawyer) who is in poor health and headed toward retirement. The opening of the movie is entirely Laughton's show, as he portrays a curmudgeonly and endearing character. On his first day home from the hospital, he soon takes up the defense of Leonard Vole (Power) a man who is charged with murder and up against a barrage of circumstantial evidence. Power is convincing as the honest and somewhat naive defendant, in increasingly over his head. Soon, Dietrich makes her entrance as Vole's cool German femme fatal of a wife. After a few flashbacks to set up the story of the murder case, Laughton takes up Vole's case. What ensues is a well-written and well-directed courtroom drama, in which Laughton continues to shine, delivering a convincing performance peppered with humor. Soon, the story takes a series of dramatic twists, during which Power plays his part as the beleaguered defendant to the hilt and Dietrich uses the gifts that made her a legend. By the end, the audience has been treated to an excellent drama with sensational acting.The result is a classic, but not an icon in the sense that Christie's short story, penned twenty years earlier, would become. While it may be the best-regarded of all Christie adaptations (Murder on the Orient Express a possible exception), the movie does not seem to have the stature it ought to have. At the end of the movie, I did not feel the same as when I read the story, and not just because I knew all along how it would turn out. With such visible talent on all fronts, I took a long look at what it was, and what was missing. The answer: Christie. The movie is good in its own right, but from the beginning misses the crucial aspect that the original story has: the mystery. Agatha Christie is the master of suspense, and throughout the story, that suspense, that anxiousness to know what will happen next, the eagerness to know where this next twist will lead, and the shock that comes at the very end, were what the story was all about. The direction the movie went, the legal thriller, substituted drama for mystery, and while the movie only added to the story, changing very little of what Christie wrote, the movie lost the grip that only she could create. Christie treated the courtroom proceedings (the centerpiece of the movie) with brevity, focusing on the intrigue surrounding the case. Also, the Hollywood ending overdoes it a little bit, and deprives the most important plot twist of some of its its emotional impact.That said, however, the movie is still a classic. Fortunately, the heart of the story was still very strong, with a unique plot and rich characters, which were taken advantage of by Wilder and the cast, respectively. And, as it turns out, the movie is a good complement to the story. To those who have only seen the movie, the story should be read to truly appreciate the missing value of the mystery. To those who have read the story, the movie nails the characters (particularly Dietrich's Mrs. Vole). All in all, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and would gladly see it again."
"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!I'm not sure I have the ability to adequately praise this film. The original short story(rather unremarkable, actually)has been expanded into a magnificent example of Hollywood entertainment at its best. In addition to perhaps the finest line-up of character actors ever assembled(next to Cukor's David Copperfield, that is), we get Laughton and Dietrich at the top of their form. The person who criticised Lanchester's performance as ""annoying"" missed the point entirely. Miss Plimsoll is meant to be annoying! Also, what's with all the bad-mouthing of Tyrone Power? ""Hammy""; ""terrible""; ""worst performance ever"". These are the perceptive IMDb reviews? Only one of you got it right: it's hammy because Leonard Vole is the one acting, not Power! For 95% of the film, the character is dissembling, only showing his true colors at the end. Of course it looks hammy: Vole isn't a born actor like his wife. And to all those know-it-alls who called this film mediocre and predictable, I look forward to your upcoming film projects which I'm sure will be paragons of excellence and worthy to be set alongside classics of the golden age."
"I love it when a movie captivates me, carries me along, then surprises me at the end. This is a masterpiece of human maneuvering. It has outstanding acting and a plot to die for. This is a fairly pedestrian Agatha Christie short story. I'm not saying it's not a wonderful story, just that it doesn't come to life like it does on the screen. Charles Laughton is the wonder barrister who is taking the case, even though he is in poor health. The murder case seems a relatively simple one until we begin to trip over the many layers left lying on the path. Marlene Dietrich does a masterful job in all her roles (I won't say anymore than that so I don't spoil the ending). Tyrone Power is able to balance his pathos and his potential guilt. The beauty of the movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. There are some modestly funny subplots and a great deal of careful investigation. I guarantee you that once you start watching, you won't be able to turn it off."
"WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! The Billy Wilder touch adds cynical wit to his sparkling adaptation of Dame Agatha Christie's play WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (WftP), with some of the best lines in a Wilder movie since DOUBLE INDEMNITY, thanks to Wilder, Harry Kurnitz, and Larry Marcus. In our household, ""Is that really desirable?"" has become a catchphrase, along with many other gems from the mouths of star Charles Laughton and the rest of the sterling cast! :-) I only hope people seeing this for the first time haven't already seen Marlene Dietrich's scene-stealing performance in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL, or they might tumble to the twist finale before they're supposed to! :-) (In fact, if I recall correctly, when WftP was shown on Turner Classic Movies, Robert Osborne mentioned in his intro that Welles helped Dietrich out with her WftP ""Cockney informant"" makeup as a favor!) La Dietrich looks fabulous and keeps you fascinated even when she's coming across as the ultimate bitch; it's a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar along with co-stars Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Tyrone Power's usual slightly wooden delivery actually serves him well as the defendant; somehow it adds to defendant Leonard Vole's air of feckless innocence. Henry Daniell, John Williams, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, and particularly Norma Varden as the ill-fated Emily French provide able support, too, with Una O'Connor stealing her scenes as Mrs. French's loyal but ""antagnistic"" Scottish housekeeper. A young, brunette Ruta Lee provides a memorable moment or two. As sickly but sly barrister Wilfrid Robarts and his chipper but no-nonsense nurse, Miss Plimsoll, real-life husband and wife Laughton and Lanchester shine in the most engaging performances of their careers. The comic sparring chemistry between Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Miss Plimsoll, and the warmth and understanding that's grown between them by movie's end, had my husband Vinnie opining that if another movie was made featuring these characters, Miss Plimsoll would probably end up as Mrs. Robarts before it was over -- what a delightful series that could have been! Hey, at the very least, I'd have paid good money to see Billy Wilder direct Laughton, Lanchester, and Dietrich in a sequel in which Sir Wilfrid prepares for the trial of Christine Vole, a.k.a. Christine Helm! :-)"
"I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and loved it.  I just watched it on VHS and was captivated all over again.  Agatha Christie's story, Billy Wilder's screenplay and direction, and the four main leads all get it right. Charles Laughton is absolutely superb, and Elsa Lanchester is a perfect foil.Agatha Christie's story has more twists and turns than a roller coaster and this provides a strong foundation for the movie. But the actors give life to the characters. I haven't seen the 1982 version, but I'll admit to a bias for Marlene Dietrich.  She and Tyrone Power pull just the right punches.It's a mystery, of course.  But a top notch one. So if you want only to dabble in the genre, this is the one to try. (If you like mysteries, it goes without saying that you must see it.) Moreover, this is one B&W movie for people who don't like B&W movies."
"That's a quotation from the film and what you'll say at the conclusion. I saw it the first time 36 years ago back when network TV ran old movies late at night, and I'd never even heard of it. I thought it was a Hitchcock film with all of the unexpected twists, but no, the director was Billy Wilder. How surprised I was to see Wilder do Hitchcock better than Hitchcock ever could! The set-up is this - Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is an inventor that is having trouble getting his inventions to market. He befriends a wealthy older woman, one Emily French. She is obviously flirting with him, and Vole, though married, flirts back, his objective being that maybe she will financially back one of his inventions. Then disaster strikes. Emily French is found murdered. Vole is an obvious suspect because Mrs. French has just changed her will and left everything to Vole. There is circumstantial evidence pointing to Vole, and he says he knows nothing about the will. Enter barrister Sir Wilfred, the finest in England, whose doctor has told him he must quit work and go on a vacation because of his heart condition. Sir Wilfred talks to Vole, believes his story, and also talks to his wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich) who backs up Leonard's story but comes across as somewhat cold to her husband's peril. Sir Wilfred is convinced to take the case and agrees to retire upon this last trial. Past that I cannot tell you any details or I'll ruin it for you.Everyone in the cast performs masterfully. Especially charming is the interaction between Laughton's character and his nurse played by his wife of then 28 years, Elsa Lanchester. They go back and forth at each other with Nurse Pimsoll insisting that Sir Wilfred keep his rigid schedule of medications and him treating her like a jailer with hilarious one liners at the poor woman's expense. Only a long married couple could do this feature length banter so well. If Nightmare Alley didn't convince you that Tyrone Power was more than a pretty face, this film will. Likewise, Marlene Dietrich is much more than a blue angel and a fine figure of a woman at age 56.Notice all of the little touches. How Sir Wilfred seems to be ignoring testimony in court by counting out his pills, only to stand up and ask insightful questions when his turn comes. Plus this film really shows that nothing is off the record, even if the judge says that it is - the jury hears and sees everything. Sir Wilfred plays on that fact.Great acting, great direction, great story - it doesn't get any better than this. Thus I give this a solid 10/10. And one irony - Power's character mentions several times about Sir Wilfred's heart, but it is Tyrone Power himself who will be dead of a heart attack by the end of the following year. Sadly, this is his last completed film."
"After the artistic success of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, the only notable film based on Dame Agatha Christie's stories was a remake of LOVE FROM A STRANGER with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney as the ill-matched couple, but re-staged in the 1890s rather than 1930 England. Then, in 1957, Billy Wilder made this production of a short story by Dame Agatha called WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. With a tip-top cast of Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power, and Elsa Lancaster, the film was a brilliantly done version of Christie's short story, changed in it's ending (but to a changed ending found in Christie's own dramatization). Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is a salesman who meets an elderly, wealthy woman (Norma Varden) and gains her affections - much to the dislike and mistrust of her servant (Una O'Connor). O'Connor claims she saw the two together the night that Varden was beaten to death in her apartment. Vole is arrested, and his solicitor (Henry Daniell) wants England's best barrister, Sir Wilfred Robarts (Laughton) to defend him. Robarts is recovering from a heart attack, and is being nursed by Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster). He is a difficult patient, and is not looking forward to an enforced rest in Bermuda. So, despite the protests of Plimsoll he takes the case. He does promise her he will listen to his doctor and take his medicine. She does not trust him. Sir Robert meets Vole's German born wife, Christina Helm (Dietrich), who alarms him. She is too cool, to detached at her husband's peril. But he goes ahead, and is soon in court fighting a first rate opponent (Torin Thatcher as Myers), and scores some impressive points against the prosecution, especially in cross-examining O'Connor. But at the critical moment he finds that by a subtle point of law, Dietrich can testify against Power, and does so. So the plot becomes, how to defeat this ""witness for the prosecution""? Is there something that can turn the tables on her and her testimony.And the evidence to use against Dietrich does appear - from an unexpected source. Is it effective? Will Power be saved in the end? Or is there something going on?Although the conclusion of this film has been pretty well known for years, I will refrain from explaining what it is. A good mystery should surprise the audience, as this does every audience that sees it for the first time. Laughton and Lancaster make a funny pair (and in the end, an endearing one from Lancaster's point of view). Power gets to play his most sinister part since ""the Great Stanton"" Carlyle in NIGHTMARE ALLEY. And Dietrich does pull off the biggest surprise twist in her career. As for Wilder, after some questionable films in the mid 1950s (THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS) he was back in form. His handling of the courtroom scenes (which make up nearly 60% of the film) are far more realistic and speedy than Alfred Hitchcock's plodding THE PARADINE CASE a decade earlier. It was the best of the Christie films prior to MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS."
"This is a fun movie, with marvelous performances by Laughton, Dietrich and Lanchester. Even the usually mediocre Tyrone Power fits his role to a tee. It's the best filming of a Christie mystery that I've seen.If you haven't seen it, though, read no further. For those of you who have, I would like to point out one relatively large flaw in the plot. Much is made during the final scene of Christine Helm's perjury. She even agrees with Sir Wilfred that she will go to prison, but teases, ""it won't be for life, will it?""Is it possible that neither Christine Helm, Sir Wilfred Robarts, Billy Wilder, nor Dame Agatha herself noticed the rather stunning fact that every word Frau Helm spoke on the stand was the absolute truth? The revelation of the final plot twist could have been that much more dramatic had she asked Sir Wilfred, in their moments alone together at the end, ""Perjury? What perjury? I committed no perjury. Leonard was guilty as charged. And all I testified about the letters was that I wrote them, not that they were true. They can't touch him, and they can't touch me, either.""It's possible that the book ends differently, and this flaw was introduced in the adaptation. Not having the book handy, I can't verify it one way or the other."
"Witness for the Prosecution is one of the most entertaining courtroom stories of all time, written by the crime mistress herself, Agatha Christie. Charles Laughton completely owns the courtroom, starring as a famously brilliant barrister who's supposed to be taking a break for his health-but he gets drawn in by a truly compelling murder trial. Tyrone Power, in his last movie, has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. While all the evidence racks up against him, Charles doesn't give up hope and tries to win the case, all the while trying to crack the very hard nut Marlene Dietrich. Marlene is Tyrone's wife, and it's impossible to tell what she's really thinking or feeling.I love this story, and I love both versions of the film, from 1957 and 1982. It's incredibly suspenseful and interesting-and also quite impossible to talk about without giving spoilers. If you've never seen Witness for the Prosecution, add this one to your list of classics to rent. The acting is fantastic, and the timing makes it a very entertaining old movie to watch. There are no boring bits in this drama; and I guarantee you'll still sit on the edge of your seat the second time you watch it."
"Naturally, the most popular Agatha Christie movie ever made, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (1957), although it looks as British as Big Ben, was actually filmed in Hollywood. Thanks to its great cast - Tyrone Power and Una O'Connor in their final movies, Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Elsa Lanchester, John Williams, Henry Daniell, and stage actor Francis Thompson as the judge - and the clever way the writers have opened out the stage play, this ""Witness for the Prosecution"" really grips and holds the interest even for those members of the audience (like myself) who know the plot backwards. Billy Wilder's direction is as adroit as ever, but on this occasion, it is skilfully impersonal, allowing players and plot to adroitly command and dominate center stage. This movie is currently available on an excellent 10/10 M-G-M DVD."
"Yours truly has never been much of a reader, though with one notable exception: the work of Agatha Christie. I absolutely, positively worship this brilliant woman and try to read as many of her novels, short stories and stage play adaptations as possible. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a genuine classic, and although somewhat atypical for Christie, it is undeniably one of the greatest stories ever penned down. There's one major disadvantage about having read all of Christie's whodunits, of course, namely that you can't experience the same astounding twist-in-the-end twice! I would really have loved to be overwhelmed by the climax of this film- version, especially because Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power give away such fabulous performances. The story, with its fascinating characters and dazzling plot twists, does remain the movie's biggest strongpoint, but there are a number of more reasons why ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is righteously considered as one of the most massive milestones in cinematic history. Billy Wilder's surefooted direction, for one, and the stellar performances of the entire ensemble cast. I mentioned Dietrich and Power already, but there's also the downright phenomenal Charles Laughton (arguably the most shamefully neglected actor/director in history) and an appealing supportive role for Elsa Lancaster. But do I daresay that the ultimate success-factor of this stage play adaptation is the masterful re-creation of the court trial? The bombastic settings and decors, the echoing acoustics, the powerful monologues of confident (and arrogant) barristers and the intimidating gowns and wigs are largely what make ""Witness for the Prosecution"" not only the first but also the mother of all courtroom dramas. This may just be the opinion of an avid fan, but practically ALL great courtroom-dramas that were released from the sixties until present day (""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Philadelphia"", ""Devil's Advocate"", ""A Few Good Men"") were clearly influenced by ""Witness for the Prosecution"". In fact, I only have one minor complaint: *** Spoiler **** the film version adds one more final twist that I didn't find 100% plausible."
"This is one of the absolute best courtroom movies ever made, along with ANATOMY OF A MURDER and THE VERDICT. All deserve a score of 10 and each is great in it own way.This film is great, but not for the realism of ANATOMY OF A MURDER. Instead, it's got such a wonderful script full of wonderful twists and turns. Plus, having top actors on the top of their game (such as Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Marlena Dietrich) made this such a great film. Plus, it has one of the best all-time endings on film.So is it realistic? Hardly, but given the magnificent script, this can easily be forgiven and just be enjoyed for the massive entertainment value it brings. If you don't enjoy this film, you must be dead!"
"It's hard to imagine how Dame Agatha could have pounded out so many mysteries. I know she lived a long time, but still, if I lived as long as Methusala I couldn't grind out that many pieces. Not just novels, either, but plays, including this one. And they all tell the kinds of stories that involve a lot of lead time while the author works out the details of the intricate plots. Between Jack Kerouac knocking out ""On The Road"" on a single roll of toilet paper or whatever it was, and Nabokov and his multitudinous 3 X 5 index cards, Christie must have been very much closer to Nabokov.This is an engrossing and tightly wound tale of greed, murder, deception, bigamy, adultery, and all the other good things in life. It's essentially a courtroom drama with several big -- REALLY big -- surprises. It does not end the way you might expect, with the true criminal suddenly revealed in all his moral turpitude by the expert, penetrating examination by the defense, breaking down in the witness chair and sobbing, ""Okay. I did it! I DID IT! I didn't mean to kill her! I just wanted to frighten her."" The play's the thing in this movie, yet the director, Billy Wilder, brings his own snappy interpretation to it. The dialog is unashamedly fast. Nobody dawdles over ""significant utterances."" Even on the witness stand they seem to make a series of unhesitating declarations. ""Yes."" ""No."" ""Yes, I told you already."" And it wouldn't be as good as it is without the acting. Charles Laughton is the central figure, one of those cute old curmudgeons that everyone likes because of his weakness for cigars and brandy. His efforts to bootleg these items under the nose of his nurse, his real wife Elsa Lanchester, are pretty funny. ""She won't even find the ASHES,"" he cackles innocently, like a child getting away with mischief, flicking his cigar ash into an empty drawer. She's always bright and chipper and energetic, a nice contrast to his flabby sedate presence.Una O'Connor as the Scottish maid is extremely engaging as well, snapping back indignantly at the judge. Tyrone Power is called on to change from a careless and thoughtful guy, to one stricken by fate, then back again, and he pulls it off. Henry Daniell, a Robin Hood villain, and John Williams, ever the legal type, are welcome in every scene in which they appear. Reliable sorts, don't you know. But Marlene Dietrich takes the palm. She was everyone's idea of a no-baloney kind of woman but never anyone's idea of a great actress. And yet, she had me fooled here. Oh, hammy, sure, but her performances fit in because EVERYONE is hammy in ""Witness for the Prosecution."" God forbid anyone try to make anything serious and arty out of an Agatha Christie mystery! They're fine, just as they are."

The ill advocate at law is attended by a nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester , they were real-life husband and wife). Excellent film packs drama , emotion , suspense and plot twists . This agreeable and often intriguing picture from master of comedy has a memorable scene after another . It contains interesting intrigue based on Agatha Christie's novel , fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The film followed the basic story of Agatha Christie's play, but director and co-screenwriter Billy Wilder opened up the story by including numerous scenes that did not take place solely in the courtroom, as the play had, and changed the emphasis from ""Leonard Vole"" to ""Sir Wilfrid Robarts¨. Top-notch and unforgettable performance from Charles Laughton as the peculiar as well as intelligent barrister , throwing himself into the role with dedication and delight . Nice acting by Tyrone Power , this would be his last complete film , he would die of a heart attack while on the set of his next film (Salomon) less than one year after release of this one . Sensational support cast , including familiar faces such as Elsa Lanchester , John Williams , Henry Daniell , Ruta Lee , Torin Thatcher and veteran Ian Wolfe . Special mention for Una O'Connor , this was Una O'Connor's last big screen motion picture and she was the only member of the original Broadway cast of the play to repeat her role on film . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Russell Harlan . The producers were so concerned about the financial success of the film that during the credits, an announcer urges the audience not to reveal the film's ending to anyone . Lavishly produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and Edward Small , as the courtroom setting, which cost $75,000 to build, was a recreation of an actual courtroom in London's Central Criminal Courts , The Old Bailey. The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines , amusing dialogues , humor and entertaining intrigue . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , this ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Witness for prosecution¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching . It justly deserves its place among the best ¨Court Dramas¨ ever made . One of the very best films of all time and to see and see again . An extremely entertaining and riveting film and completely provoking , as it ranked #6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"" . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same ."
"Let me explain.The best book on music I've ever read is ""The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven"", by Charles Rosen.  (Read it, it's fascinating.)  One of Rosen's claims is that the classical style was the offspring of two impulses: the desire to surprise, and the desire to be formally perfect, to sound ""right"".  In the decades before Haydn's maturity there were composers who startled and composers who satisfied; Haydn was the first to startle and satisfy in the same breath.Detective story writers have the same ideal as classical composers.  The solution must surprise us; yet the ""shape"" of the story, to those who know the solution, must be beautiful.  And, as in music, it's hard to surprise and satisfy at once.  If you must go one way or the other, much better to satisfy.  One can see the denouement of a Thorndyke story by R. Austin Freeman a mile off, but it's always perfectly crafted, and that is enough. Too many modern detective stories startle us by having the murderer turn out to be one of a dozen characters when it could so easily have been one of the other eleven and nobody would have particularly cared because there's little beauty in the story whoever it turns out to be.  But Agatha Christie ... not for nothing is she called ""classical"".  Her solutions are almost always surprising - she may have been better at misdirection than anyone else who ever lived - but they always, in a way that's hard to describe, make perfect dramatic sense.  -Okay, so she's not the world's best mystery WRITER.  But I often think she attracts undue criticism because she so obviously writes less well than she plots, while the literary defects of writers who can't plot either pass unnoticed.For all these reasons I'm surprised there aren't more first-rate films based on her works.  (I can understand, though, why ""The Mousetrap"" has never been filmed.)  Looking through the IMDb list of twenty-eight cinematic Christies, I'm surprised how many of the ones I've seen fall short of their potential. And twenty-eight isn't really, when you think about it, that many, especially when so many of them are remakes of earlier ones.Still, most are worth watching, and this particular one is excellent. Faithful to the play, it has the usual finely crafted, classical, Agatha Christie twist.  Wilder made it at a moment in his career when he could do no wrong.  It must have taken him all of two seconds to decide that Charles Laughton would make the perfect Sir Wilfrid; then, perhaps, another fifteen minutes to settle on Marlene Dietrich as the title character.  Just as ""Double Indemnity"" is set in a black-and-white California, ""Witness"" is set in a black-and-white England - it makes me wonder if it's a mistake filming Agatha Christie in colour.  You'll enjoy this, trust me."
"I have no idea why I'm writing this review. There are already 125 other reviews here, and that odds that anybody's even going *see* mine are slimmer than an already-slim person on a severe diet.What's more, I don't have anything new to add. I just finished watching the movie for the first time, and I thought it was just magnificent. Wonderful cast, wonderful performances, and a completely engrossing and surprising plot. And even some charming humor on the side to keep things from getting too grim. I was able to foresee some of the ending but definitely not all of it.So anyway, the main point I would want to make is just this: If you have NOT seen this movie, do NOT read any reviews with spoilers! Just see the movie!"
"This movie is truly gripping. The actors involved are top of the line and they all have the ability transport the viewer into the film and make you forget your surroundings. This movie is worth watching. I am not a fan of Agatha Christie, but this movie is one of my favorites. Charles Laughton makes this movie. He is what drew me to the movie to begin with. I was not disappointed.Marlene Deitrich and Tyrone Power play their rolls to the max and manage to play both the jury and the audience to the end.This movie is well worth watching."
"Hollywood's Golden Age set the standards for how great films should be made with its pioneering narrative and visual approach. There were countless great works that emerged from ingenious directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Capra and Billy Wilder. One particular masterpiece from the latter was the 1957 courtroom drama Witness for the Prosecution.When a young man (Tyrone Power) shadily becomes the beneficiary of a recently murdered wealthy widow, he must testify to his innocence with the help of a master barrister (Charles Laughton) recovering from a heart attack. His immunity ultimately rests with his wife's alibi who opts to be a ""witness for the prosecution"", making for a tumultuous trial for the aforementioned men.I can't say enough about this film's quality – it was simply outstanding. When it was originally released, audience members were actually given and asked to sign cards that read ""I solemnly swear I will not reveal the ending of Witness for the Prosecution."" At a time where twist endings were not ubiquitous, it certainly would have stunned quite a few people. But this film unquestionably shines from beginning to end and merits a viewing from any film lover.There are many fascinating characters that bring the Agatha Christie play to life. Marlene Dietrich is phenomenal playing the accused's wife in a cold, calculating manner. Tyrone Power gives a great performance as a timid man who, for the most part of the film, is subdued in his distress. Charles Laughton, playing the defense's attorney, absolutely stole the show for me. His sharp-witted and astute character is an absolute joy to watch during the trial. He makes the trial process an enthralling, entertaining experience that seems to never have a dull moment.It is character-driven, stimulating films like Witness for the Prosecution that remind me of just how great courtroom dramas have the potential to be. This film manages to keep you in a tight suspense while simultaneously managing to be humorous, incisive and intelligent. The use of long takes and the authentic feel of the court atmosphere converts the viewer into an onlooker in the courtroom with the others. Yet another masterpiece on Billy Wilder's impressive repertoire and one of my favorite films of the Classical Hollywood Style. The man was a genius in so many ways."
"Charles Laughton is absolutely hilarious and superbly witty as barrister/solicitor in this film, in fact- I cannot recall any courtroom lawyer who has a better grasp of language cadence and tone and pitch as the great Charles Laughton which makes his courtroom defence posturing unlike any! Further, outside of the court, Charles has such a finicky and droll humour that I was so tickled by his badgering of his nurse (who happens to be his wife in real life).Marlene Dietrich is superb as well. She just commands the screen and that wonderful German accent is spellbinding.Tyrone Power is a powerhouse but I found that he somewhat over-acted just a tad for my liking; however, this does not deter the quality of the entire movie.This is a terrific movie with a great little twist at the end, so stay with it right to the very end!"
"Leonard Steven Vole finds himself on trial for the murder of a wealthy widow from whom he has inherited a fortune. Top barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts takes up the defendants case, but he, along with everyone else, is stunned when Vole's seemingly loving wife Christine turns up to testify against the defendant.Based on Agatha Christie's successful 1953 play, ""Witness For The Prosecution"" benefited from fine tuning from master director Billy Wilder and writing partner Harry Kurnitz. Here the dialogue becomes razor sharp and the characters are fully realised with quite wonderful results, but chiefly the masterstroke here is not letting a court room drama become just that, a court room drama. The film plays out with no wasted scenes, no moments of boredom, and it has such vim and vigour you sometimes forget that there actually is drama in the story.The cast here are on fine form, Wilder had wanted to work with Charles Laughton for some time, and it's obvious that both parties here are getting the best out of each other. Laughton is a pure delight as Robarts, a sharp tongue, all bluster and cheeky into the bargain, his interplay with Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's real life wife Elsa Lanchester) is quality, and it's another testament to Wilder's genius for putting them together. Tyrone Power, in what would be his last completed film before sadly passing away, is devilishly smart as Vole, whilst Torin Thatcher is great as the gruff prosecution barrister Myers. Yet as good as they all are, they all sit in the shadow of Marlene Dietrich and her turn as Christine Vole, sultry and femme fatalistic, it's a sizzling performance that crowns this delightful film.It occurred to me overnight that it's probably the closest film that Wilder got to being Hitchcockian, and I'm pretty sure the big master of suspense himself would have enjoyed this one. It's a mystery that is dramatic, it's a thriller that is also funny, it's pretty much a multi genre classic. 9/10"
"2 Caveats: Of course Laughton and Lancaster are a joy, whenever you can view their work. And I love fantasy such as Wizard of Oz, Princess Bride etc..romantic stuff when it's done right. That said: 1) A very naive audience is required not to notice that a piece of evidence (particularly a knife) does not remain on an attorney's desk, or anyone's desk in a courtroom after a trial has been concluded. It would have been taken back by the bailiff before the conclusion of the trial to be returned to Vole along with his other belongings as the judge said. Might I humbly suggest that Christina be carrying a small revolver instead?..Too late! 2) That was the fastest death by knife wound in cinema history I believe, taking about two seconds. No effort was made to revive the victim.3) Vole's ""new girl"" the brunette, just stands there watching as he gets stabbed. She didn't see any attack coming after pointlessly and mercilessly taunting Christina? 4) Are we to believe that an attorney could produce any letter that would clear a client without corroboration? The judge had denied the request to submit the letters only minutes earlier. At a minimum, if they had been allowed as evidence, the witness who possessed the letters would have been called in as would a handwriting expert.5) After the trial, everyone proudly admits to the crime right there in the courtroom. If they were clever enough to conceive the plot why would they? Reminds me of the old Batman comic strip, ""Criminals are a cowardly and stupid lot."" Listen up kiddies, there's the moral.6) No defendant is allowed the liberty of a running commentary during the testimony of other witnesses without being warned by the judge that they are out of order. Is there no English equivalent of contempt of court?"
"When the efficient but bitter and stubborn barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) returns to his office in London recovering from a heart attack, he is invited to defend Leonard Stephen Vole (Tyrone Power), who is the prime suspect in a murder case. Leonard is a former soldier that fought in World War II and is married with his beloved German wife Christine Helm Vole (Marlene Dietrich). He is unemployed and accused of seducing and murdering the wealthy middle-aged single woman Emily French (Norma Varden) to inherit 80,000 pounds. His unique alibi would be the testimony of Christine, which would not be accepted by the court, since she is his wife. Along the trial, Christine is surprisingly called to testify in court by the prosecution, when secrets about their lives are disclosed. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is another remarkable movie of Billy Wilder and one of the best about trial. The plot is perfectly tied-up without any flaw in the screenplay, which has many plot points and witty lines in a perfect combination of the caustic and sarcastic ""British humor"" with crime, drama and mystery. The cast has awesome performances, highlighting Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. Billy Wilder is one of my favorite directors and his direction is once again outstanding. Last time I saw this movie was on 12 March 2005 on VHS and today I have watched it on DVD for the fifth or sixth time. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Testemunha de Acusação"" (""Witness for the Prosecution"")"
"Alfred Hitchcock once remarked that he often had fans approaching him to say how much they enjoyed 'Witness for the Prosecution (1957).' Knowing Hitch's wicked sense of humour, he probably would have gone along with it, but that doesn't change the fact that the film belongs to Billy Wilder, however reminiscent of a Hitchcock picture it might be. Adapted from a short story, and subsequently a play, by mystery author Agatha Christie, the film has a distinct theatrical feel to it, the story gradually unfolding mostly through dialogue, with the occasional important flashback. Just as 'Witness for the Prosecution' feels like the work of the Master of Suspense, it noticeably lacks the classy style of the actual director, with the confines of the courtroom drama perhaps unsuited to Wilder's trademark sparkling repartee {though Charles Laughton certainly gets in a few masterful wise-cracks}. Nevertheless, it is a genuinely thrilling and engaging mystery with an ensemble of terrific characters.Charles Laughton's Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an outrageously entertaining creation. Though having only recently recovered from a crippling heart attack, the attorney maintains a constant state of grumpiness, gruffly dismissing the well-meaning instructions of his insistent nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's wife, Elsa Lanchester). Though his health often causes him problems, and he hardly seems to be paying attention in the courtroom, Sir Wilfrid is the finest defence lawyer that the city has to offer, a shrewd and calculating legal genius, and a firm believer in the judicial process. When an agitated and seemingly-innocent young man, Leonard Steven Vole (Tyrone Power), is charged for the murder of an older lady friend (Norma Varden), our weary hero commits himself to proving the man's innocence in court, even though their chances of acquittal are seriously marred when the accused man's German ""wife"" (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against him.Much too often, time has ruined some of cinema's greatest twist-endings, and it always grieves me to have the finales of classic thrillers spoiled before I have the opportunity to watch them. In the case of 'Witness for the Prosecution,' I can happily say that I was caught completely off-guard, having not even been aware that the film contained a twist. Better yet, Agatha Christie manages, in the story's final moments, to cram in a quick succession of unexpected plot-turns, with the ending leaving us stunned and dazed, feeling as foolish and devastated as Sir Wilfrid must have been when he realised that he had just unknowingly rescued a certain murderer from punishment. Most definitely in the top five courtroom films I've ever seen, Billy Wilder's 'Witness for the Prosecution' is a different kind of classic for its legendary director, and a motion picture that, yes, I'm sure even Hitchcock would have loved."
"My 9 rating is due primarily to Laughton's wonderful performance, but the whole film is immensely enjoyable and has been so completely reviewed here that I would only like to express some long-standing feelings/questions about it at this point: 1. The big problem the film has is a padded-out quality, and I have felt this every one of the 25 or more times I've seen it since 1957. If the flashback scenes showing Power and Dietrich first meeting in an early post-war and near-bombed-out Berlin are not gratuitous, they are close. They do not appear in the original Christie story or play, and would seem to have been added to the film in order to more or less 'equalize' the roles of Power and Dietrich with that of the real protagonist of the film, Laughton's Sir Wilfred. Without those flashbacks, both leads are almost subsidiary characters; even with them, Laughton remains the focal point of the entire film. One can almost see Wilder devising these added scenes as an inducement to get two major stars to accept roles in what he must have immediately recognized as a ""Laughton film"". The other flashbacks added, of Power and the murder victim, at least serve to make that otherwise unseen victim a bit more human to the viewer, and she is wonderfully, even lovably, played by Norma Varden (who also came close to a permanent end at the hands of Robert Walker in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN). But the flashbacks do impede both the continuity and the forward motion of the film.2. From my first viewing, I have remained unconvinced that that is Marlene Dietrich as another character whom we see meeting Laughton to sell him some much-needed evidence. And even if it is, it is certainly not Marlene's voice delivering the cockney lines the lady emits. Later on, towards the end of the film, when Dietrich goads Laughton with a repeat of her ""Want to kiss me, Ducky?"" line, she is very obviously being dubbed. Dietrich was a solid (if somewhat limited) actress, but this part of what is supposed to be her performance is quite simply beyond her abilities. If this is so, I wonder who the actress was who actually did it, and how much they had to pay her to keep her contribution to the film totally, and seemingly in perpetuity, anonymous? If this had been a Hitchcock film, this would surely have been addressed and solved by now, but we don't look as deeply into Wilder films, even when one like this is about as close as he ever came to doing a Hitchcock film.3. Due to the movie Code in place at the time, where one simply could not get away with murder, the original and excellent twist ending of the Agatha Christie story and play had to be changed for the film, but in this case Wilder came up with a double-twist (almost a triple-twist) ending that was more exciting and dramatically satisfying than the original's, while still fully meeting the Code's standards. A dozen years earlier, a similar situation involved the movie version of Christie's classic AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, and in that one, too, the movie people came up with an ending quite superior to the original. And if you know Christie's writing, she was the absolute mistress of twist endings, and to outdo her twice in this area speaks well for what the imposition of an often ill-advised Code could achieve when properly thought out.4. The Laughton role in the original play was played by the great Francis L. Sullivan, but he died before the film version was made. It would not have mattered, I suppose, because Sullivan's drawing power in films would not have been a tenth that of Laughton's, but it is fascinating to imagine what he might have done with it. (While on this subject, I might add that in the 60 years I have been reading Nero Wolfe novels, and seen or heard him impersonated by Edward Arnold, Walter Connolly, Sydney Greenstreet, William Conrad and Maury Chaykin, the only actor I have ever envisaged as Wolfe was Francis L. Sullivan - along with a young James Garner as the perfect Archie Goodwin - but that it now occurs to me that Charles Laughton might well have passed muster as the mercurial Mr. Wolfe. Too late now for all concerned!)"
"One of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, many people confuse the director for Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense, in fact this brilliant marvel of a movie was directed by none other than Billy Wilder one of the most bewitching director and writer of early Hollywood. The movie is a beautifully scripted courtroom drama with comic, dramatic and suspenseful elements based on the play by Agatha Cristie. It brings you unprecedented acting by Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. The role of the accused was played by Tyrone Power who delivers a very inspiring performance that manages to capture the sympathy of the audience. The simple set of the movie (The courtroom, The judge's house etc) indulges the audience to focus more on the actors and their astounding performances. The sole reason this movie left me in complete and utter awe is of course the twist ending, classic with Agatha Cristie plays, that I will not reveal for obvious reasons. I usually figure out movies with twists but I must say this came to me as a surprise, as I thought the movie was over. Summarizing, this Agatha Cristie courtroom drama gives us profound acting performances and delivers us a story with tremendously suspenseful cinematography and one of the best twist endings I've seen. Thus I give this beautifully wonderful movie a 9/10."
"I watched Witness For the Prosecution tonight, and was struck by it. It is an interesting courtroom drama with solid performances all round; compelling in it's style and makeup, and well directed. But the ending, after such a plausible and almost beautiful winding story of complete believability. . . left me shaking my head in disbelief. How the film makers could allow such a fine picture to collapse with such a concoction of trumped up melo-dramatic absurdity in the final scene goes beyond absurdity. It was as though someone in the production staff decided they had to save Charles Laughton's (who gave a grand performance as the lead defense English barrister, Sir Wilford Robarts) reputation, so that he did'nt come off looking as though he had been duped by the main characters involved in the murder he was defending. Afterall, Laughton had been the beloved protagonist featured as the barrister hero throughout the film. So at the end, when the wife (Marlene Dietrich) saves the murderer (Tyrone Power) from the gallows, they had to quickly concoct a scene to avenge the wicked and scandalous trick that had been played on the defense team, the law, and the true hand of justice. If they had allowed the husband and wife to walk off together hand in hand into the sunset at the end, I would have said this is one of the greatest courtroom pictures ever made. But Billy Wilder could have done much better with the ending IMO, which had nothing to do with plausibility, and for me almost ruined the picture. Kudos to the actors, especially Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Elsa Lanchester. More kudos to the director who clearly did a masterful job right up until that final silly scene that kind of ruined it for me."
"Hollywood legend Tyrone Power, in his final completed film role, plays Leonard Vole, accused of the murder of a lonely rich middle aged woman, Mrs. Emily Jane French (Norma Varden). They'd struck up a friendship, and he continued to see her in the hopes that she'd finance the inventions that he wanted to market. Now she's dead, and all evidence points to him being the killer. Taking his case is the irascible, witty barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts (Charles Laughton, in a delicious, Oscar nominated performance), who's recovering from a heart attack.This viewer shouldn't relay too much about the plot, but, as adapted from Agatha Christies' play, it's riveting stuff. While it obviously derives from a stage work with so much focus on dialogue and performance, it's the crackling, often funny dialogue and superior acting that makes this so effective and seemingly quickly paced for a film running just under two hours. The script, written by Harry Kurnitz and the well regarded director Billy Wilder, obviously takes great delight in the twist laden scenario. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is often throwing surprises at the audience, and while more savvy folk may be able to predict a fair deal, the ways in which characters and viewers alike are manipulated is nothing short of masterful.There's a great deal of humor to be found in the relationship between Sir Wilfrid and his nursemaid Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester, a.k.a. Mrs. Laughton). She's annoying in a lively, endearing way, and his reactions to her are simply priceless. Lanchester was also Oscar nominated for her scene stealing, comedic work.There are no slackers here, especially when you realize there are performances within performances being given here. Power is quite engaging, and Marlene Dietrich is highly striking as the German woman whom he took as a ""wife"". Wonderful support is provided by John Williams, Henry Daniell, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, Ms. Varden, Una O'Connor (that scenery devouring player from some of the Universal horror films of the 1930s, cast here as the housekeeper), Francis Compton, Philip Tonge, and Ruta Lee.The filmmaking is slick without calling attention to itself, with Wilder and company completely trusting the source material. The result is a smashing entertainment that deserves to be rediscovered.Nine out of 10."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Witness for the Prosecution"" (1957) is a definitely very entraining picture for those who love good court room dramas where everything is at stake and at the end they say ""guilty / not guilty"" and more is revealed at the very last end with double schemes and etc.There are some silly moments mostly involving Miss Plimsoll character. But the film is very entertaining, it features great performance by Charles Laughton and fun to watch performances by Marlene Dietrich (""Damn You!"" - what an acting! :)) and Tyrone Power. Directing is very solid, script is involving and picture is wonderfully paced - at running time 1 h 53 min it never drags and is involving and entertaining from start till finish.Overall, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is very entertaining mystery and court room drama. Acting is electrifying, although it features some silly and in my opinion unnecessary scenes with Miss Plimsoll they don't harm the overall experience which is very positive."
"I just finished watching Live Free and Die Harder for the second time. I was blown away by the special effects, and Bruce Willis' capability to take more punishment than a human could be expected to and live.After that I wanted something that had the same fireworks but done with acting and not special effects. This film fit the bill nicely.The acting in this film was so spectacular that calls for every superlative in the book. While I have watched Billy Wilder direct comedy, I never expected to see him do something that rivals Hitchcock. In fact, if you didn't know it was Wilder beforehand, you would easily call this a Hitchcock film.Tyrone Power as the defendant was so smooth that you knew he was a guilty man. You just knew it, even though he kept denying it. He was perfect as the cad that preys on elderly women. Marlene Dietrich gave what I thought was the performance of a lifetime as his wife. She definitely provided the fireworks and the surprises to this film. Charles Laughton as the barrister that tried the case was magnificent. There are not enough words to describe the performance he provided. Supreme enjoyment every time he opened his mouth. Of course, you cannot ignore Elsa Lanchester as the nurse that failed miserably at trying to control Laughton after a heart attack. The two of them provided so much humor to this film that one would want to see it again and again just for that.Nothing can be said about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. It is well worth the time in finding it on cable or adding it to your queue."
"Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an ageing London barrister recently released from a recuperative stay in hospital. Defying his doctors, he takes on the case of Leonard Vole, a ladies man accused of murdering a spinster for her money. With no alibi, a choice motive, and Voles' own wife testifying against him, can Sir Wilfrid win the case before the strain kills him ?Based on a great play by Agatha Christie, this is one of three classic fifties courtroom dramas (the others being Anatomy Of A Murder and Inherit The Wind) with a cracking plot and a terrific cast. The histrionics - both real and fabricated - may be a bit extreme at times, but Power, Dietrich and especially Laughton are so perfectly matched to these characters that it doesn't matter. The supporting cast is full of wonderfully mad players, such as O'Connor (the housekeeper in Bride Of Frankenstein), Daniell (Garbitsch in The Great Dictator) and Williams (the Inspector in Dial M For Murder), but best of all is Laughton's real-life wife Lanchester as his long-suffering nurse, constantly bearing the brunt of his bilious spite - ""If you were a woman Miss Plimsoll, I would strike you."". In Wilder's capable hands, the comedy and the intrigue are beautifully balanced - the timeless Dietrich even gets to dress up as a Cockney scrubber in one scene and belt out a song in another. This is also a movie which piles clever twist upon clever twist into the last reel, a hugely influential technique which a lot of films have tried since but relatively few have managed to replicate with success. A great old movie, stuffed to bursting with entertainment value; okay, these people may be larger than life, and the last act is completely screwy, but as legal hijinks go this is first-rate fun."
"Witness for the Prosecution is one of the great courtroom dramas on par with Anatomy of a Murder, 12 Angry Men and To Kill a Mockingbird. It is also the finest adaptation of a Agatha Christie novel.In large part, credit has to go that brilliant writer-director Billy Wilder, who gave cinema so many other noir and comedy classics. This is a thriller with a good bit of comic relief in the verbal sparrings of real-life husband and wife Laughton and Lanchester as a Barrister with a heart condition and his erstwhile nurse respectively. Both give brilliant performances in their own right.The dialogue is brilliant, the plot twists are very intelligent, surprising yet believable. Marlene Dietrich also has a sizeable role with a minor love story thrown in. Tyrone Power, who I never liked is his usual wooden self.A highly recommended film classic for all ages. Do not miss this one!"
"This Billy Wilder-directed adaptation of Agatha's Christie's Witness For the Prosecution features Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton, and these three leads could easily have appeared in a 1937 version, except that Christie hadn't written it yet, and so this film is from 1957. It's a story about a man on trial for the murder of a woman he'd only fairly recently become acquainted with who left him a large sum of money in her will, and who has a flimsy alibi as to his whereabouts on the night of the murder, and is in very deep trouble indeed. Fortunately for him, a first rate lawyer has agreed to take his case, and all kinds of complications ensue till the surprise ending, in which everything comes together, but not as the first time viewer might have expected.There's a lot of good and bad in the film. The good is a tight script; and a a bravura performance from Laughton as the lawyer (okay, barrister) with health problems; Laughton's real life wife, Elsa Lanchester, as his nurse, is delightful; Tyrone Power, as the accused, is nicely enigmatic and ambiguous; Marlene Dietrich, as Power's neglected war bride wife brings her own special brand of charisma to her role; while John Williams, Una O'Connor, Henry Daniell and Ian Wolfe are all splendid in supporting parts. As to the bad, the movie is dull looking, resembling an episode of a television series of its time. It lacks the fine tuning of the best of Hitchcock, or for that matter Billy Wilder. The pacing could be better. While I wouldn't call the movie slow moving it never at any point really catches fire. It feels rather chilly throughout. There's not much in the art direction or the photography to draw the viewer in. Wilder serves his material and doesn't bring much of himself to the party.What keeps the thing humming is its plot, which is a good one. Ty Power uses his charm skillfully in his early scenes, yet seems to lose focus later on. Laughton brings gravitas to his role but somehow fails to bring the much needed moral authority his character presumably possesses, which is absent from the actor's performance. Too often Laughton just seems to be indulging himself, which is fun to watch but not really right for his character. Dietrich seems to be working extra hard and actually convinces me that she is or could be Power's wife.Overall, Witness For the Prosecution feels like a ""leisure movie"" for its director. Wilder wasn't exactly slumming when he made it, but he wasn't running on six cylinders, either. It plays well enough, keeps the viewer's attention, yet lacks a certain heart, fire, intensity, something that might have elevated it to the level of a classic. It's definitely worth a peek if one likes murder mysteries, but it's not in the same league as Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder, which is a far more engaging movie. There's no flamboyance and little style to Witness. As a footnote it's worth mentioning that this was Tyrone Power's last or nearly last movie. He shows himself to good advantage, as it mustn't have been easy to for this middle-aged former matinée idol to have played a murder suspect named Leonard Vole. Power was clearly moving in a character star direction, and doing well at it. Had he lived longer and continued in the same vein he might have given Dirk Bogarde a run for his money over the next decade."
"This is a movie that makes me believe that cinema is timeless, because it is, in this case.
The plot is intriguing with a top notch ending and the actors and actresses makes believe we are really in a court room."
"The story nicely bring on a classic base of mystery of whether or not the client is guilty, the most often used premise of court movies. The movie nicely reveals the details one by one in an ordered manner, all the while having refreshing inserts of laughable remarks and mannerisms by Sir Wilfrid. What's really nice is that the details are placed so very neatly, scattered across the movie's duration, all the way up to the ending. Yet it must feel so very surprising in the times this movie was released. But today audiences are highly anticipative thus the placement and insertion tricks done in this movie will never work. The ending will have been spoiled at the very first appearance of Christine, especially if the audience marked closely on Leonard's description about her. The acting overall is just standard in my view. Tyrone Power didn't even bother to conjure up a decent British accent. Marlene Dietrich's emotion play may look astonishing at those old times but it sure is not now. The fact that she didn't change her voice, only her accent, when her character was supposedly under cover may well make the ending very predictable even for beginners to spot."
1st watched 11/4/2001 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Billy Wilder): Well-done courtroom drama with many twists at the end with a unique trailer that asks all who watch this to not reveal the ending to others.  So I will obey and not give this away to anyone.  Laughton is wonderful as the aging & ailing defense attorney(barrister in England) with a typical mysterious performance by Marlene Dietrich and a sometimes hammy performance by Tyrone Powers.  A lot of talented people were a part of this production of a Agatha Christie story & screenplay including Director Billy Wilder.  They all came through remarkedly and presented this story as it is(a well-written courtroom drama that was originally a play).  Wilder did a good job of letting the actor's play this story out and it shows in the final production.
"WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is a great courtroom drama that contains elements of thriller, mystery and dark comedy. The film is based on the short story and theater piece of the same name by Agatha Christie. A poor innovator was arrested for the sensational murder of a middle-aged and wealthy widow. The old and respected lawyer, despite ill health, can not resist this seemingly hopeless case. The case is further complicated when the wife of the accused agrees to testify against her husband...This serious courtroom drama is ""mottled"" with tense and comical dialogues at the same time. This approach, in addition to the standard tension, is causing a good mood. Mr. Wilder has managed to create an atmosphere where emotions are literally burning. This claim is justified by an explosion at the end of the film.Charles Laughton as Sir Wilfrid Robarts the senior counsel is stubborn, witty and determined patient or lawyer. He is an extremely charismatic and dominant character. His appearance is very funny in this movie. Marlene Dietrich as Christine Vole/Helm, the accused's wife is a key character in the story. I thought that this is another example of a femme fatale, but I was wrong. Ms. Dietrich is something special and it is a privilege to enjoy her appearance and performance.Tyrone Power as Leonard Vole, the accused is somewhat inconclusive. Maybe it was a deliberate spoof by Mr. Wilder. However, his laid back approach and mixed emotions during the trial seem unconvincing. Elsa Lanchester as Miss Plimsoll, Sir Wilfrid's private nurse is the nicest protagonist. Mr. Laughton in the fight against his wife for a cigarette and a glass of brandy. I would describe their relationship as a kind of story in the story.John Williams as Mr. Brogan-Moore, Sir Wilfrid's junior counsel in the trial remained in the shadow of his mentor. Humorous interruptions are also lacking. Una O'Connor as Janet McKenzie, Mrs. French's housekeeper and a prosecution witness has through small role revived some of my memories. I just enjoy every time while watching the little ""chatterbox"".Changes in mood and tempo, black humor that is ubiquitous, interesting and tense ""fire"" in the courtroom and excellent characterization are the advantages of this film.Simple, classic."
"I am not going to discuss the plot... look elsewhere here for information on that .. and on information about the production... but it a film that is graced by fabulous performances.Laughton blusters and puffs but his character has a mind like a razor. Dietrich is just extraordinary.. I defy you not to watch her every move. Elsa Lanchester is marvelous as the not quite so foolish nurse. Tyrone Power is all easy smoothness... he may be innocent but is he? (There is a lot of unfair criticism of Power's performance here... I think people miss the point and Power is actually precisely what he needs to be as Leonard Vole)The film is a masterpiece of direction, of writing and acting.Perhaps a little dated in style but breathtaking in its mix of drama, comedy and thriller.BUT for me above all else it is the acting not only of the principals but the whole cast (even the lovely Norma Varden as the victim is a delight) that brings me back to watch this film again and again."
"The combination of Agatha Christie's play, Billy Wilder's fluid direction, and superlative performances by Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Tyrone Power combine to make this film quite extraordinary, if outré. Laughton plays a brandy-swilling English barrister defending Power on the charge of murder; Dietrich is Power's German wife, who claims her husband is guilty; Elsa Lanchester (never better) is Laughton's devoted nurse and John Williams (superior, as always) is his legal assistant. Don't be put off by the powdered wigs or the legalese; Wilder keeps this intriguing case peppered with amusing incident, and the double-twist finale is staged with aplomb. If it's a bit over-the-top, that's forgivable, for the picture is full of ""actors"" (on the surface and undercover) and everyone here has a grand time. *** from ****"
"Among black and white movies there are some which stand on their own merits as genuine Classics. This is one of them. The Movie is called "" Witness for the Prosecution. "" If you have read the book, then see this film you will not be disappointed as it is directed by one of the best, Billy Wilder. The story is set in England and spins the unlikely tale of Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) a handsome young man accused of murdering a wealthy woman who left him a sizable amount of money in her will. Once on trial for murder he is able defended by noted barrister Sir Wilfrid who does a splendid job. (Charles Laughton) The entire case stands precariously on a sole witness named Christine. (Marlene Dietrich) The story runs smoothly as does the play and all the characters from Elsa Lanchester, John Williams to Henry Daniell do their part to ensure a dizzying display of early stage theatrics. Watch this from the start to it's end and see if you're not surprised by the ending. I was! Superb movie and a must for Power fans. Easily Recommended. ****"
"The film is based on Agatha Christie's story with the enormous twist not on the last page but on the last line. Billy Wilder's direction is perfect and all actors get it right. Charles Laughton is absolutely superb; he has the best lines and scenes and he brings the wit, intelligence, and the heart to the film. Marlene Dietrich is perfect playing not one but three roles, convincingly transforming from one character to another, from the present to the past. This is not just a good mystery but a classic of the courtroom genre and a very enjoyable film even after you know the ending. ""Witness for the Prosecutionis"" is one of my favorite Agatha Christie's screen adaptations.9/10"
"I, myself, am not a fan of Agatha Christie's or of any of her followers; I rarely find the strength to keep up with all the clues and the various witnesses, lawyers, cross-examinations and objections which all lead up to the inevitable conclusion that, well, The Butler Did It. I can certainly understand the appeal in this kind of puzzle-movie; it just never appealed to me. To me the main problem with this kind of stories is that usually, more emphasis is put on the clues than on the characters  and so, when the real murderer is finally revealed, I say: ""well, how about that?""  I simply don't care.But in every genre there are always some creations that transcend the genre. Witness for the Prosecution stands as a true masterpiece among the Whodunit murder mysteries, one that will be pure ecstasy to fans of the genre, but is also a fantastic creation on any level and in any standard. This one proves just my point, that a clever story with a lot of characters and a lot of clues and misguiding clues just isn't enough; Christie's play is masterful, of course, and the twist at the end is one of the great classic shockers of cinema, one that matches modern classics like The Usual Suspects and Memento, if not transcends them; but it took more than the story to make that ending work. The reason it all works so well is because the characters are so captivating. That is thanks to two elements  first, Billy Wilder's (Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd., The Seven Year Itch) masterful direction, and an ensemble of fantastic actors, all of whom bring their characters to life; Charles Laughton is beyond brilliant as the aging, ailing, wily solicitor, and Tyrone Power is electrifying and fascinating as his client. Most of all the diva Marlene Dietrich grants a truly show-stopping performance, and steals the show from the rest of the cast  proving just how great she really was.By far the greatest trial drama ever made, and one of the greatest murder mysteries, it took the combined talents of Christie, Wilder and the fantastic cast to create such amazing drama in the courtroom alone; Witness for the Prosecution is basically an ensemble piece that is no more than a theater production, but Wilder uses the full powers that he has at his disposal as a film director  close-ups, music, cinematography, lighting  to their full potential; and thus once again it is proved that he is one of the most underrated directors in history. This is a classic that deserves to be remembered with the very best films of all time."
"Just watched this film for the third time and it still made for a very entertaining viewing. The story progresses smoothly, without any complications (despite the rather unnecessary flashback sequences), and there are enough plot twists to keep the audience interested. Even if you're not too keen on courtroom dramas, you should take a look at this one.Marlene Dietrich gives a surprisingly impressive performance as the seemingly deceitful wife of the defendant, played by Tyrone Power, who is effectively sympathetic in his role. However, the real gem of this film is Charles Laughton's marvellous portrayal as the grumpy old barrister, whose banter with his energetic nurse (Elsa Lanchester) adds a nice comic touch to the proceedings."
"Christie is one of our most treasured and adventuresome experimenters in narrative twisting and knotting. She's a master of taking popular material and packaging it in complex ways that are accessible. Wilder is a master on the converse: taking sometimes complex material and packaging it in simply accessible ways.There's a mismatch that works against the material in these two strengths. Still, Wilder pulls off what is the best Christie adaptation in the sense that he retains the possibility of figuring things out, though Deitrich's disguise is pretty thin.Christie tried every way she could map of shifting our expectations of who is providing truthful elements of what we see, or think we see. In this case, it is folded into a play within the play in the form of acting for the benefit of a jury. The twists are in the liar, the intent and the guilt.Funny thing about Wilder. He made competent movies of all types, including the two folded masterpieces: this and ""Sunset Blvd."" But he doesn't seem to have captured a lot of subsequent filmmakers in his wake, while Christie has, By the hundreds.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"After the verdict, Mrs. Vole is alone with Sir Wilfrid in the otherwise empty courtroom. She shows Sir Wilfrid that she was the Cockney lady and tells him that Leonard was guilty of murdering Mrs. French. Sir Wilfrid, mad as can be, tells her she will undoubtedly be tried for perjury and sent to jail. She replies that she doesn't care as long as Leonard is now free.But her reply is inaccurate. In fact she told the complete truth on the witness stand. She never committed perjury at all. And by this time Sir Wilfrid should realize that Mrs. Vole's testimony was the complete truth."
"A man (Tyrone Power) is accused of allegedly murdering a woman. His wife (Marlene Dietrich) also believes he did it and testifies against him in court. A powerful, brilliant lawyer (Charles Laughton) believes Power is innocent and does his best to prove it.Sounds dull but it's not. I caught this on TV way back in the 1970s. I started watching it casually but very soon was caught up in it. The script is smart and, even though it's over 2 hours, it never feels too long. There are many ingenious twists and turns and an ending that (I have to admit) I didn't see coming at all. I've seen it many times since and never tire of it.The acting is great. Power is good in one of his last roles; Laughton is just superb as the lawyer--he throws out one liners or insults so casually that it's hard to believe he's just acting. I never found Dietrich that good of an actress--I hate to admit this, but her accent always made me giggle. However she's great here--especially at the end. Also Elsa Lanchester is a scream as Laughton's by the book nurse. Her and Laughton had a marriage of ""convenience"" for many years and their fondness for each other comes through making their verbal fights even funnier.A wonderful, exciting, fun courtroom drama--one of the best ever made. Well worth catching. I give this a 10."
"Based on the wonderful play by Agatha Christie, the film version of Witness for the Prosecution is a magnificent film, one of the best ever. It was given the all star treatment - directed by Billy Wilder, starring Tyrone Power, Marlene Dietrich, Charles Laughton, and Elsa Lanchester. Right there is all you need to know.This is one of Charles Laughton's greatest performances. He's absolutely superb as the ailing man who risks his health to defend Leonard Vole (Power) on a murder charge, over the strenuous objections of his nurse, Lanchester, who is hilarious. Dietrich is great as Leonard Vole's seemingly uncaring wife, Christine, in the most difficult role in the movie.As Leonard Vole, Tyrone Power is a little more problematic as he is somewhat miscast. One of the most beautiful-looking men who ever lived, he's a tad old for the role, not quite jaunty enough when he needs to be, and very un-British. For an international star to have put on a British accent after 22 years in films would have been both distracting and ridiculous. However, no one could do charming like Power, in real life and in reel life. In that sense, he's perfect. As far as comments that he was ""hammy"" in the role - he wasn't the ham - Leonard Vole was the ham! It was a role within a role. Power hands in an excellent performance, his last, and he's especially enjoyable in his flashback scene with Dietrich (who during the filming kept bringing him gifts while Charles Laughton leered at him - I'd say he still had it big time). If you haven't read the play or story, you won't guess the ending of Wilder's masterful film. Oh, and look for a young Ruta Lee in the courtroom."
"The superb adaptation of Agatha Christie's play is evident in this movie of 1957, which, by the way, it's still interesting to watch today, as it must was in the theater. The film was greatly helped by the direction of Billy Wilder who was able to achieve great performances all around from his cast.Of course, this film belongs to Charles Laughton's brilliant performance as the barrister, Sir Wilfred Robarts. Mr. Laughton's genius was evident in his body of work, but with this role, he excels. Charles Laughton was one of the best actors of his generation. This courtroom drama packs a lot of surprises. One of the most pleasant ones was Marlene Dietrich. She played the German wife of the man accused of killing the widow he seduced for ulterior motives. Ms. Dietrich who was one of the coolest actresses of her era, shows a range not seen before. Her character is seen at different times of her life and she is totally convincing to be that person.The weakest link in the film is Tyrone Power. This actor was getting over a heart attack and he shows that illness had not been kind to him. His interpretation of Leonard Vole is a puzzle, at best. He is supposed to be an Englishman, but his American accent was something the director, or the studio didn't care much since Tyrone Power was one of the greatest stars in the business. His portrayal of the accused man robs the film of authenticity. This role should have been played by a British actor.The incomparable Elsa Lanchester makes an appearance as Sir Wilfred's nurse, a role that was not in the original play. Ms. Lanchester was an wonderful actress who could steal films from leading stars. In this film she is fabulous as the meddlesome nurse who wants the best for her patient. Also good in the film, Una O'Connor as the maid, Janet McKenzie who can smell a rat when she sees one. Norma Varden as the widow, Emily French was delightful. The English cast is excellent."
"Charles Laughton (surely one of the finest actors who has ever lived) put on an absolutely superb performance in this movie as the aging and well known defense attorney Wilfrid Robarts, who is hired to defend a man accused of murdering an elderly widow he had befriended in order to gain her estate. Laughton manages to combine comedy (he's at times very funny, particularly in his exchanges with his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester) with great drama and he does it seamlessly; everything about this movie flows absolutely perfectly. His client is Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Powers.) Powers also seemed to me to capture the essence of his character - sleazy looking enough to make you wonder if he's guilty, but also angst ridden enough to make you doubt that he's guilty. Of the main actors, I wasn't especially taken by Marlene Dietrich as Vole's wife Christine. I haven't seen a lot of Dietrich's work, but from what I have seen I have to confess that she's never really turned my crank; she's no different here. Something about her performance (here and in other bits of her work that I've seen) just comes across as artificial. I can't explain it any better than that. Having said that, one performance that to me was sub-par (and her performance here probably suffers mostly in comparison with Laughton and Powers) can't detract from an excellent courtroom drama that keeps you guessing right up to the very end. The last twenty minutes or so especially are full of so many twists and turns that your head is spinning by the time it's over. I also appreciated the look at the inside of a British courtroom and its procedures, since most of the courtroom dramas I've seen are American. (As an aside, it was interesting to see Ian Wolfe as Robarts' valet Carter. Wolfe had a very long career in movies and television, never from what I can remember as a star, but as a supporting actor or guest star in everything from great movies such as this to TV shows like ""Star Trek"" or ""WKRP in Cincinnati."" What was most interesting about him was that from the time this movie was made in 1957 to his later work in TV he doesn't seem to change. He's immediately recognizable.) As for this movie, it's a truly excellent piece of work. 9/10"
"A gem of a 1957 film. How Tyrone Power wasn't nominated for best actor here was a major surprise. Charles Laughton was and deservedly so as the terrific defense attorney who brought comic relief into the film by fooling Elsa Lanchester, who received a supporting actress bid. Remember how he would smuggle liquor into the courtroom and manage to sneak a cigar when she wasn't around? His performance was as always a masterful one.As Paul Vole, Power is a man accused of murder. He calmly assumes the role of being accused of a murder. He definitely receives sympathy from the audience during his outbursts in court when his wife Christine (Dietrich) testifies against him. The victim was veteran Norma Varden (the housekeeper years later in ""The Sound of Music."") Marlene Dietrich was his love interest who gets him off only to have quite a rude awakening afterwards.The film was terrific in every way possible. You want to sympathize with Power and then have utter contempt on him when it appears that he has pulled a fast one on the judicial system. Charles Laughton is absolutely magnificent as Sir Wifred, the defense attorney, who undertakes the case after recently suffering a coronary. He is a master in the court when he challenges just about everything that the prosecuting attorney states. Dietrich has never been better. She comes across as an uncaring wife, despite the fact that Vole has brought her out of the ruins of Nazi Germany in 1945. Veteran pro, Una O'Connor, steals the scene she is in as a witness who was Varden's maid and apparent heir to the latter's fortune before Power stepped in. As his nurse, Elsa Lanchester, the real life Mrs. Charles Laughton, was also Oscar nominated in the supporting Oscar. A pain in Sir Wilfrid's rear end, she comes to realize that her patient will not be ready for that Bermuda vacation at the end of the trial. This best picture nominee of 1957 is well-worth seeing. Billy Wilder's expert direction must be viewed."
"When an old, poorly-healthed judge Wilfrid Robarts is approached one night with a baffling case concerning Leonard Vole, the accused, it is up to him to try and find out what really went on. This job is not made easy for him when he meets the accused's cold wife, played with ice intensity Marlene Dietrich, who, for some reason, seems to be working against her husband. Who is really telling the truth? Anybody who knows Agatha Christie will know that nothing is ever how it seems. Just when you think you've found a red herring, you find out that you were right along to then find out that everything was a bluff. Or something. So the plot twists, even for those who are familiar with Christie, will always surprise. And nobody is better chosen to adapt her play than Billy Wilder, one of Hollywood's best capable, adaptable directors. He classily uses the courtroom backdrop with deft ingénue, creating a film with courtroom drama elements, as well as petty comedy and sizzling suspense, all brought together by the excellent performances.As the grumpy defence lawyer with an overbearing nurse, Charles Laughton combines comedy and drama excellently, never failing to make us smile, but also shining at the dramatic moments. Elsa Lanchester, who was married to Laughton in real-life, has great chemistry with him in their light-hearted banter. The other performance in the film that stands out is from Marlene Dietrich, as Vole's ambiguous wife. As Christine, she uses her wintry persona to perfect effect, creating a character that is as intriguing as she is dislikeable.A few tiny quibbles. The plot, though interesting, could never happen in real life. Things work out just a tiny bit too conveniently. But overall, this is a finely made, superbly acted, and very gripping mystery. Another hit for Mr. Wilder. Check it out.A-"
"Billy Wilder, assisted by a tremendous cast of actors, does a brilliant job of adapting and filming a classic Agatha Christie story in ""Witness For the Prosecution"".  The movie has everything a great mystery should have: memorable and interesting characters, satisfying plot twists, excellent dialogue, plenty of suspense and tension.  This may be the best adaptation ever made of one of Christie's legendary mystery stories.Christie's original was only a short story, and it has been modified considerably for the screen, with the characters and events fleshed out, new characters and scenes added, and new additions made to the plot.  There is even an added surprise twist at the end - that is, on top of the already masterful twist from the last line of Christie's story.  All of these additions fit in perfectly with the original idea, and even a literary purist should find the film version to be a worthy tribute to the great mystery author and her conception.Most of the movie is driven by the battle of wills and wits between Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich), whose husband is accused of murder, and Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton), who is defending the husband. Laughton and Dietrich give brilliant performances that get the most out of their already fascinating characters.  Tyrone Power also succeeds in the challenging role of the actual defendant, Leonard Vole, a man who seems simply to be caught in the middle of the battle between his strong-willed wife and lawyer, but who may not be as helpless or as dependent as he seems, after all.  There is also an outstanding supporting cast (including the always wonderful Elsa Lanchester) that makes the secondary characters an important part of the story.All of the actors and characters fit perfectly into the splendid story that Christie wrote.  Add in Wilder's carefully-conceived adaptation and flawless direction, and ""Witness For the Prosecution"" is a masterpiece that will be enjoyed by anyone with even a casual interest in mystery films."
"A decent murder mystery is composed of A) unique perplexing crime, followed by B) a unique but insightful solution that allows C) a reconstructed throughline that isn't completely ridiculous. Ideally a smart viewer can play along and pick up clues to assemble the solution but it's not mandatory, and most mysteries from Sherlock Holmes to Sam Spade ignore that last merit. Most movies hope to wow you sufficiently with the solution that you don't go back and test it for believability.Mediocre mysteries always get one of the parts wrong, and it's usually item C. The correctly ordered universe when you piece it together is often silly and overextended beyond belief. And the explained universe is either of no special consequence or composed of absurd or impossible elements.The crime here is so trifling that it doesn't merit the solution or the elaborate smoke-screen. It's so utterly non-complex that one is starved in the end for a surprise/twist, and Christie half-heartedly obliges. Just who are these criminals who can't be bothered to waste an ounce of intelligence on preventing detection, but who stockpile oodles of criminal brilliance and subterfuge for their trial? On top of that, they chose an actress who couldn't pull off the dual role and had to be dubbed.Tyrone Power is looking way old here; too old to be playing a gigolo. Never did I imagine a movie with this title would concern itself with a failed egg-beater inventor... surely one of the most absurd characters ever written. There is no explanation for the generally high ratings this gets here. It's almost completely unremarkable. You can watch this in eleven segments on youtube. This is one of a handful of low points for Billy Wilder."
"I don't think that it is quite as good as And Then There Were None, but this is an extremely good film, and I am 17. Both my dad and I think it is a well-directed, well-acted and well-constructed courtroom film, right up there with Anatomy of a Murder. I genuinely enjoyed this film, and really don't understand why it is ignored by people.The direction was solid and tight, as is usually the case with the late Billy Wilder. He deserves to be known as a great director, up there with David Lean and Alfred Hitchkock, both of whom have directed some of the greatest cinematic masterpieces in existence. What impressed me most was the nail-biting suspense put into the script, which was not only tense but very funny as well, evident with the character of Sir Wilfred. I would have never guessed the final solution, that Christina Vole was the gypsy you meet halfway through, even if I was an Agatha Christie fan or not.The acting was what made the movie. Tyrone Power was very good as the defendant Stephen Vole, accused of killing a spinster. It is so sad that he died a year later while filming Solomon and Sheba, but he did very well in his last completed role. Marlene Dietrich was brilliant as Christina, and her scenes in the courtroom are the main reason why this film should be seen. Stealing the film, however, is Charles Laughton as Sir Wilfred Robarts, with his acidic remarks and his charismatic presence. The scene with the monocle and the light is probably the most famous scene of the film, or certainly the one I'm most familiar with, and that was genius.In conclusion, a brilliant film, that just lacks the suspense and terror of And Then there Were None, though both films are full of both elements. A must see! 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"My problem with this movie was a hole in the plot. No sudden reversal could occur based solely on some letters. Where was the murderer? There would have been much more investigation and interrogation of Dietrich by the detectives after the letters were discovered. Detectives scoff at ""the missing man"" murder solutions. Remember OJ Simpson's defense? They have seen every possible ruse including this common one. They would have immediately thought of a ""wife""/accused collusion. It is a missing man murder -- we are supposed to be so wowed by the blue stationary denouement not to think these things out.That said we have to suspend disbelief in most movies why not this one?I did not have any trouble with this as the acting particularly of the Lawyer were very entertaining and the direction and general movement of the movie decent. However, the final twist where Dietrich stabs Powers seemed unnecessary and squirrelly.I prefer movies that fit into the real world and don't assume the audience are idiots. Surely the book had a fix for the missing man problem.RECOMMEND..YES there are so many far worse movies...but beware it is over rated."
"Verily defines top flight film-making.With some quirks. Made in the 50s which many consider a ""lost decade"" for Hollywood, the age of the B-movie, the time when Hollywood chased the teen market.A cast of greats doing great work. A wonderful and flawless script with a twist-reversal at the end that pretty much set the bar a dozen other movies since which have shamelessly copied it.And one of the most extraordinary performances ever put on film from an actress who strictly speaking did very few English movies, making this a rare treat.Marlene Dietrich at the peak of her star power, steals every frame she is in, projects a character so powerful (for a woman) that it is hard even today to find the equivalent combination of poise and strength and femininity.There is a specific scene in the film - a bonus if you like -- in which Dietrich plays a second role right in front of the audience and even if you watch the film many times you will still have trouble believing it is her, so astonishing is the acting.One of those films, if you were lost on a deserted island and could only pick a handful of DVDs, this is one of the keepers."
"The script of this Witness for the Prosecution manages to captivate thanks to delicious and incredibly well written dialogues, and Charles Laughton's performance who superbly delivered them and who clearly stands out within a cast that has no big flaws but isn't exceptional either. The plot however lacks sometimes a bit of interest, and the rhtyhm a bit uneven doesn't play in favor of this very static movie.But the main point for which it can be blamed is its ending, not that the ""initial"" twist is bad, far from it, it's excellent, but it is followed by a series absurd and very little credible twists. The explanation for this improbable outcome lies in the Hays Code, this censorship code that governed Hollywood's productions from 1934 to 1968 and obliged Wilder and his writers to provide this rather twisted (!) ending that inevitably impacts the quality of the movie on the whole, which remains a notch below 12 Angry Men for example."
"I started watching this movie with very least interest since besides being quite old and black and white,it is expected to be quite slow.At least that was on my mind,but with every next scene movie goes on impressing me thanks to the humor added Charles Laughton as an old lawyer.Witness for the prosecution is based on Agatha Christie novel.I previously encountered with another movie on Agatha Christie novel ""Murder in Orient Express"",and I wasn't quite impressed with that so expectations were low.But at the end I loved this movie because it gives you a big surprise in the end The movie deals with a man on the trial of murder.Its hard to imagine such movie in 50's because it seems so fresh today also.Watch it out guys,it's something special !!!"
"Everything snaps, crackles, and pops in this delightful courtroom mystery, one of the best films Wilder ever directed. The cast is superb. Laughton and Lanchester, of course, and Marlene Dietrich gets one of the best roles of her career. Although she gained fame originally as a sex symbol, movies like this show what a fine and intelligent actress she was. It's really a shame she didn't win -- or even get nominated -- for an Oscar. She certainly deserved it.The seamless mixture of comedy and drama in the brilliant screenplay should be studied by all aspiring screenwriters. The funny scenes never detract from the suspenseful, serious story -- they actually make it stronger. Some may feel the melodrama of the final moments seems a bit contrived, but that's a very minor quibble.WITNESS is one of those rare perfect movies. What a pleasure to watch a film where everything -- writing, direction, acting, music, photography, you name it -- is exactly right and blends into a terrifically entertaining whole."
Even though i predicted the wife's double play.. further twists were unexpected. The lawyer's acting was brilliant
"The movies shows the star power of its cast from the starring to the smallest supporting role with great direction from Billy Wilder. A classic of the golden age of Hollywood meant not just for movie scholars and fan of the genre, but every person with any interest in movies."
"It has been only some two months since I watched the recent, also Agatha Christie's based, Murder on the Orient Express. Even though one has a 60 year advantage over the other, Witness for the Prosecution was an incredibly better movie.I really love it when a film gets me so caught up that I feel at the same time worried and excited about what it's happening. It starts slowly with a calm slow pace, setting up the plot very similarly as the Sherlock Holmes cases, and at the same time Sir Wilfrid becomes irreversibly involved with the case I was unaware of how much I myself became involved in the plot. Superb movie."
"The perfect movie for insomniacs like myself who caught this epic courtroom drama on TCM commercial free with no interruptions.Our story begins with a renown British Barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts played by Charles Laughton. Sir Roberts, stout yet refined complete with monocle recovering from a recent heart ailment is cared for by his personal nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster) who was in reality Laughton's real Wife. The arguments and condescending quips being thrown by Sir Roberts at the overbearing nurse was probably as close to the real home life of the Laughton's as you can get. Enter the distressed, accused, and care-warned Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power). Miss Plimsoll strongly objects to her personal patient taking on any cases after Sir Robert's ailment. Sir Roberts hears out Voles statement as the accused claims his innocents to the murder of Mrs. Emily French a rich older woman who was fond with Vole, infatuated as to go so far as to make him the beneficiary to her will. I Personally enjoyed the credible performance here by Power as I the viewer, was convinced of his innocence done so naturally and humbly, Unparalleled acting. Sir Roberts takes the case under the consternation of his dictatorial nurse yet smooth as silk in his retorts to his nurse were just as caustic which gave the film comic relief throughout the entire film entwined in this unique murder trial. Vole claims to Sir Roberts that his Wife would testify on his behalf. Enter the cold, self assured Mrs. Christine Vole (Marlene Dietrich) who tells Roberts and his colleagues a different story which quashes any alibi's for Vole. Vole is arrested swiftly and detained. The flashback scenes in Post-War Germany when Leonard talks about how a ceiling fell on him during his first meeting with Christine at a makeshift nightclub packed with eager G.I.'s who attacked her, ripped her pants. Dietrich showcases her talents with song and accordion. The trial begins with a cavalcade of familiar British heavy's known for television work in the 60's. Familiars like John Williams as Brogan Moore, (Robert's right hand in legal matters), who temporarily replaced Sebastian Cabot as the butler on the sit-com Family Affair. William exposure on American television was wide spread with a popular commercial for decades about classical masterpieces. Henry Daniell as Mayhew known to TV viewers as a frequent player in Boris Karloff's Thriller. Other familiars actors not born on the British Isles despite the queens tongue are Ian Wolfe as Carter known for his roles in Star Trek. The ever present Torin Thatcher as the Prosecutor Myers who was frequent guest on Science fiction related shows. Lost in Space,Time Tunnel, Voyage to the Bottom of The Sea and Star Trek. FYI last film for Tyrone Power who died a year later of a massive heart attack and last film for veteran actress Una O'Conner. Fabulous ending with tremendous shock value which felt like a Hitchcock film but Billy Wilder always gets lost in this masterpiece. His best directorial to date, but the book by Agatha Christy had more impact than the film but doesn't Hollywood always water-down screen plays to suit actors and budget. Laughton's performance was outstanding and that comedic timing impeccable."
"I have never seen a Billy Wilder movie that I didn't like, and to say that ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is another example of his masterpieces does not do it justice (pun not intended). In the movie, American Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power, who died shortly after they finished filming) is accused of murdering a woman in England. He hires Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton), a reputable attorney, to defend him. To get more information about everything, Robarts consults with Vole's wife Christine.But that's where things take an unexpected turn. As the trial - and the movie - progress, we keep learning secrets that the characters have been keeping. By the courtroom climax, all bets are off, to say the least.This just may be the perfect movie. No matter what you suspect, I guarantee that you will be surprised. You will never look at a trial the same again. And above all, it confirms Billy Wilder as one of the greatest directors in history."
"Typical of Billy Wilder films, Witness for the Prosecution is mediocre and overrated. I don't know how his fans defend him so passionately. Sure, he made a few great films, but looking at this courtroom drama, one of his more popular films, how can anyone deny how hackneyed, predictable, and often just how plain stupid it is? I hate courtroom dramas, but this one is particularly laughable in its depiction of courtroom activities. Fortunately, it does contain two brilliant performances by Charles Laughton and his wife, Elsa Lanchester. Laughton plays the lawyer who defends alleged murderer Tyrone Powell (in his last performance, and what must be one of his worst). He has recently suffered a heart attack, and is advised to take it cool for a while. Elsa Lanchester is his pesky nurse. Their chemistry recalls their great performances in The Private Life of Henry VIII from a quarter of a century earlier. These two keep this sinking ship of a movie from becoming totally sunk. In fact, with the clever twist at the end, I was almost ready to say I liked it; the three good points, Laughton, Lanchester, and the twist made the film a somewhat pleasant waste of time. But then there is a second twist which is utterly forced and utterly idiotic, so my final verdict must be a slight disapproval. Still, if you haven't seen it, Laughton and Lanchester are worth the time. 6/10."
"Witness for the Prosecution (1957)Billy Wilder is one of the three or four really great directors coming out of post-war Hollywood. ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Sunset Blvd"" and even ""The Apartment"" are flawless films. Flawless and brilliant, visually flashy, inventive, and touching. And Wilder was more prolific as a writer than a director, and in ""Witness for the Prosecution"" there is less of the cinematic genius and more of the literary one. He had one of the great popular storytellers of Britain of the time at his side, too--Agatha Christie. In fact, it's an expanded version of one of her stories. Some of the repartee between the leading lawyer, played by Charles Laughton, and his nurse, played by Elsa Lanchester, is especially funny when you know they were married at the time.The other great actress here of course is Marlene Dietrich, who is cold and clever and virtuosic. They even have a flashback so she can play, twenty-five years after the fact, the kind of entertaining role she was known for in the days of Josef von Sternberg (as in ""The Blue Angel""--the little nightclub in ""Witness"" is even called the Blue Lantern). The key to the whole story is the plot, which is smart and believable. The acting is lively, and the whole enterprise is far funnier than you'd expect (even the judge is witty). There are twists and then more twists. If the camera-work isn't Billy Wilder's best, it is still fluid and functional. (We can't blame the cameraman, the brilliant Russell Harlan, who did any number of visually astonishing movies, like ""Gun Crazy,"" for starters.) As much as this is a very British seeming film, and of course Christie is very British in her material and style, the whole enterprise was filmed in California. You'll never know it, however. A terrific film."
"Billy Wilder directs this screen adaptation of Agatha Christie's play. Marelene Dietrich, mysterious as ever, is the wife of an alleged killer(Tyrone Power). Maybe the best acting comes from Charles Laughton as the tireless defense attorney. Great script; very good acting; and a suspenseful and intelligent story line with a few twists and turns before its over. Acting in support: John Williams, Elsa Lancaster and Una O'Connor. Dietrich is always Dietrich and Power comes off a little ""hammy"" at times. Witness this classic for yourself."
As a fan of Alfred Hitchcock films and Agatha Christie Novels I couldn't wait to watch this movie. I became drawn in to the story like a little child.Great plot twists!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie!!
