"This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.
Barbara Stanwyck, in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career, represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death, if necessary) in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the `femme fatale,' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess, seductiveness, and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films, the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead, as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson, the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity) and Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff, her victim'), have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed, and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that, their mutually calculated interaction, although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen, is exactly as it was meant to be, because it represents each character's intentions, even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter, conversely, methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly, and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise (and sinister) intentions, and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film, Edward G. Robinson, plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company, having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's (and Walter's, technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end, the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances, the brilliant and imaginative direction, and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent, excellent filmmaking, and is a classic film that should not be missed."
"This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it's a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as ""cheesy.""I read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,For a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.Stanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, ""Body Heat,"" starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one."
"I've now seen this movie 14 times in 25 years, at all times of the year, in all moods, sober or not etc - but always at night. I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it's been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.Woman and man agree to murder woman's husband but on the way to the cemetery they face grilling by insurance company. I think everything has been said before on the IMDb - by those who think it's one of the best films ever made! To those who simply think the main problem is that it's dated I wish you could see the TV commercials that dug into DI back in '87 - what a hoot - and compare. I've just noticed the print TCM UK is showing in 2005 is lip-synced out, very wobbly Rosza music track, fading and ageing fast - worse than my 1987 video tape (maybe logically). They're supposed to be encouraging people to enjoy the classics but they won't do that with such inferior screening copies. Dear TCM UK, this is an impressive iconic film - it deserves a billion dollar remaster authorised by the Library of Congress, not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes to fill those 2 hour slots.Everything about DI from the acting, production, direction, and music is superbly dignified and is as ""close to perfection"" as human beings are probably allowed to get with this form of Art - especially with the more limited technology at their disposal in '44. When most films from now are long forgotten and dated DI will still be getting re-runs on TV and art-house cinemas - God and remasters willing - that is the fact of it.Fortunia Bonanova certainly was fortunate to have appeared in bit parts in 2 of the best films ever made - Citizen Kane the other."
"If you are a noir fan then this film is an absolute must see. The screenplay itself is a work of art in its charater construction, plot structure and dialogue which is delievered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delievers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.I personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them. Billy Wilder should be proud of this work eventhough the Academy didn't see it fit to reward him for his efforts, however I personally think this film is an absolute winner."
"There are occasional times when all the elements come together to make a great film that will stand the passing of time. ""Double Indemnity"" seems to be an example of this phenomenon.First, there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers, James Cain, who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then, the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it, Billy Wilder, a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler, a man who knew about the genre.""Double Indemnity"" works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage, who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator, Phyllis Dietrichson, doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about, thinking he is doing something else, will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try, with disastrous results. The director, who was working under the old Hays Code, shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors, yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life, as well as in fiction, there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First, there i Jackson, the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train, contemplating the passing landscape. Then, no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys, the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at ""Double Indemnity"" when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson, as Barton Keys, makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is, in a way, Walter's worst nightmare, because working next to Keys, he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines, Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz, who will go on to direct films, is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best: Billy Wilder!"
"""I liked the way that anklet bit into her leg. I wanted to see her again, up close, without that silly staircase between us.""--Walter Neff, after meeting Phyllis Dietrichson This is Fred MacMurray like you've never seen him before. He's edgy and sharp, and amoral, although he hides it well from his boss. Barbara Stanwyck's astounding performance set the standard for bad girls in Film Noir for years to come. I love this film because it is a perfect example of how the censorship of the time made it so that filmmakers had to get the sexiness across in a subtle way. This movie is undeniably sexy, and there's not a single 'love scene' in it!"
"Double Indemnity begins with a car speeding on a dark, rainy night.  This begins the classic film noir plot.  Billy Wilder directs a steamy and grabbing film.  Billy Wilder pulls this film together with an awesome cast, perfect lighting and an amusing script.  Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an unsuspecting insurance salesman.  He is unsuspecting in the sense that he is unaware of what the femme fatale' is going to put him up to.  Barbara Stanwyck plays the femme fatale', Phyllis Dietrichson, a manipulative housewife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.The film begins in present day giving insight into Walter's current plight. Walter Neff gives the voice over as the plot unfolds.  It starts in the present time allowing the audience to know what crime has happened without the interesting details to support it.  This is an interesting twist to the common film noir plot.  Knowing the crime at hand keeps the audience hungry for those details.  Walter is the victim of the beautiful woman who manipulates him into pulling off a murderous insurance fraud scam.  Walter is an impeccable insurance salesman and Phyllis, in some ways, forces him into providing her with what she needs.  Phyllis is the typical femme fatale' who has no problem in using others to get what she wants.Throughout the film Walter is completely enamored by Phyllis.  Walter could have coined the pet name baby' with his fondness towards Phyllis by calling her that throughout the film.  He is easily distracted by her beauty and evil charm.   He seems to be entranced by Phyllis's ankle bracelet, so much that he mentions it numerous times.  This allows the audience to feel the sexual tension between the two.  Phyllis, on the other hand, shows the audience that she can use and abuse anyone who gets in her way.  While believably attracted to Walter, Phyllis keeps him hopping to fulfill her needs.  She pulls him in and handles him like a puppet.  She is the epitome of the film noir genre's femme fatale'.Barton Keyes, played by Edward G. Robinson, is Walter's co-worker and friend at the insurance company where he works.  Barton closely investigates all insurance claims that come across his desk.  While at one time Walter assuredly agreed with this practice, once Barton starts to unravel the mystery behind Mrs. Dietrichson's insurance claim, we begin to see just how nervous and paranoid Walter is.  Walter then begins to see Phyllis in a whole new light.  Barton plays the integral part by piecing together details that are thrown around throughout the film.  This keeps the tension high for the filmgoer.  These details are pieced together perfectly through to the end.Double Indemnity has the perfect plot with the perfect cast.  Walter and Phyllis' attraction are tasty and the crime is wonderfully puzzling. Double Indemnity is the true film noir giant."
"Double Indemnity is a film which fully embodies its genre, all the classic noir elements are present: venetian blinds, diagonal lines, a femme fatale and a victim of fate.Fred MacMurray takes the central role as victim of fate, Walter Neff; cast against type, MacMurray gives a thoroughly convincing performance as a typical insurance salesman transformed into a calculating killer.The estimable Barbara Stanwyck also delivers a typically faultless performance as the coldhearted and seductive Phyllis Dietrichson who enlists Neff in a plot to kill her husband and cash in on the insurance money.Although this film may seem clichéd today, as many thrillers since have offered similar plot lines, rarely has the story been told so well. For fans of Film Noir, Stanwyck or MacMurray, this is an absolute MUST SEE!"
"Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.Double Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.An insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a man with `no visible scars', starts to lose his already shaky dominance over his mind's yearnings when glimpses on a horizon a possibility of becoming a recipient of a monetary fortune along with no less seductive desire from a part of unhappily married and as devilishly beautiful as resourceful in pursuing her zany in its deadliness schemes, an ultimate femme fatale blond Phyllis (marvellously portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck).Initially apparent as a romantic, the relationship gradually mutates into double confrontation of the two fears of the two characters in their greedy and ambitious pursuits, a conflict which at one point apparently results in a sort of humanization of Phyllis' character, appearing hiding the eyes of her soul behind the sun glasses, a humanization which is let to happen by her only to accentuate later her unchangeably fatal nature.The double confrontation gradually evolves into a triple one when the threatening presence on the scene of no less and probably more resourceful character of Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes more and more evident, as a result of his continuous and obsessive investigation conducted with different but nor less ambitious motives. A motives which find its ultimate revelation in a most touching, but finally most hypocritical scene of declaration of love (I love you - I love you too) between Walter Neff and Barton Keyes in the end, exactly reflecting the same nature of previous interactions between Walter and Phyllis, where such moments with the very words used, such as the supreme word of loving affection - Baby lowered to an unthinkable extent, only were a mere preparation to struck another blow in yet another outburst of hate caused by a new misfortunate complication in carrying out so well devised and apparently perfect plan.
Permeated right from the start to the very end with the flavour of unstoppable fatality in an extent that a few other film-noirs achieved, accentuated by the wonderful music score by Miklos Rozsa, Double Indemnity's story is motored by the money like in nearly all of Billy Wilder films. But in this case all the misery produced by it as evident as never before resulting in utter corruption of already corrupted characters and their descent into a such a deep abyss of human misery as probably never before or after in a Hollywood film history, an abyss with no exit, with omnipresent hypocrisy, with no place for sincere human feelings of love, friendship or affection, an abyss to where the characters descent under the monotonous tune of Miklos Rozsa's score, which serves as a reflection of their monotonously hypocrite and ultimately doubly doomed lives. 10/10"
"This film is great fun. Sxity years later, it's as taut and engaging and beautiful as any contemporary story.It simmers, it sizzles, the tension between Neff and Dietrichson is positively palpable. But, as the tension between Neff and Dietrichson fizzles, the tension between Neff and Keyes heats up.It's as pure a sample of classic film noir as there is, and it does it with unparalleled style.This is what movie-making is all about. It's not a labrynth of characters and trick endings and gimmicks. In fact, the movie starts with our tragic hero admitting he's the who whodunit...what are we left with?The story of how and why he dunit, of how he was intoxicated and bewitched, yet came to his senses, not soon enough to save him legally, but at least to come to terms with his own failure."
"Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder's first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .This first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain's novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for ¨Body heat¨ by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber ."
"Classic tale of double-cross and scheming is done to a nicety. Never mind the fact that the script is formulaic and predictable, and the characters are all selfish and self-serving. Just sit back and enjoy some great acting and smart direction.Billy Wilder knew exactly how far to stretch this tale of an insurance salesman who fatefully falls for the femme fatale who would spell ruin for him. He knew the strengths and weaknesses, and he let it ride from there.Fred MacMurray gleefully overplays his stereotype hero guy. He's got the smarts, the looks and he's almost got the dame. As said beauty, Barbara Stanwyck is a must, and few could do this sort of thing better. Cap all this with the dry, witty performance from Edward G. Robinson who lives and breathes insurance claims. He gets all the best lines and devours them.In a nutshell you have here a must for any 40's film buffs.Sunday, November 1, 1998 - Astor Theatre"
"This film noir classic may be the best murder mystery of all time in this storied Hollywood genre. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are excellent but it is Barbara Stanwyck who really makes the picture come together as a woman without a moral compass. Stanwyck set the standard for tough, calculating, shady women who exploit men without shame or remorse and her masterful manipulation of MacMurray is the movie's central theme. The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting, accompanied by a tense, brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely. Robinson is on target as the skeptical and suspicious boss who has a sixth sense about phony insurance claims. A nice supporting cast contributes to this thriller, namely Richard Gaines and Porter Hall."
Everyone knows this film and everyone loves it.I tried to observe some flaws if there are any in it. The actress playing the daughter looked too old for the role. Stanwyck was 37 when this was made and Mc Murray was 36.I agree with the reviewer who stated Mc Murray's later roles in TV sit coms and so forth tainted his image. It's true it was hard to take him seriously.A new Cadillac driving around the rail road tracks might attract some notice especially in 1939 (the year this is supposed to take place).Also you have to suspend disbelief that Mc Murray would be so smitten by Stanwyck he would attempt anything like this. She is not especially at 37 (or any age!) the most attractive woman in the world. The blond wig? I guess was supposed to make her look ?? maybe cheap or tainted. She can carry any role though plouging through it like a bulldozer.But these are so minor. I loved the movie watch it and read the other reviews.RECOMMEND HIGHLY
"There were some superb thrillers coming out of Hollywood in the forties which did not rely on the private eye conventions  but somehow the best of them were spread throughout by the same cynicism, the same realism, the same ruthless suspense Best of all was Wilder's ""Double Identity."" It was based on a real-life assassination in New York in 1927, when a wife and her lover killed the husband for his insurance money In the film, a near-breaking-point tension was reached and sustained in the passion of an insurance salesman and a passionately sensual femme fatale  an intense desire for each other and for money; in the murder of the poor husband; and in their useless attempts to escape the ability of a fast-talking investigator"
"From the first time he sees that ankle bracelet, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a doomed man. As Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) descends her California home's spiral staircase, we are as enraptured as Neff. And it takes little time to figure out that being enraptured by this femme fatale is a very dangerous position to find oneself in. Is it accidental that the bracelet is worn around her ankle, as opposed to the more traditional wrist? Is it accidental that the sunlight streaming through the windows cast shadows not unlike bars across the living room? I suspect it's about as accidental as Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) eventually ending up dead along the railroad tracks. We must remember that Billy Wilder is doing more than evoking noir here, he's inventing it. And how brave he is! Beginning the film by all but divulging the ending is hardly the route most directors choose to go when directing a thriller. But as he's well aware, the audience doesn't care half as much about where they end up as they do about the thrill of the ride it takes to get them there. The structure of the film is familiar to anyone who has seen ""Body Heat,"" or any other knockoff. ""Double Indemnity"" is the original however, and it's intricate plot revels in its complexities nearly as much as Walter and Phyllis do in their convoluted plot to dispose of an unwanted husband. The audience learns only a minimum about the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dietrichson, but we easily surmise that their union was not out of love. If the marriage was one of convenience, than the murder certainly is. It seems unlikely Phyllis is after the freedom to continue her heady tryst with Walter, and even the money provided by the double indemnity clause of Mr. Dietrichson's life insurance policy seems more like a bonus than a motivation. In other words, Phyllis just wants her husband dead. And Neff obliges. Several times while watching ""Double Indemnity,"" I felt my pulse physically quicken. These scenes were most notably the ones in which it looked as though Walter and Phyllis' trolley car had finally reached the end of its line, and discovery of their crime was inevitable. The scene where Phyllis is forced to hide behind a door, knowing that incrimination awaits if the person on the other side sees her, is unrelenting in its suspense. After all, we want this reprehensible act to go off without a hitch every bit as much as they do. That is the sign of a good film. It also stands to reason, seeing as how we were there when the elaborate scheme was being plotted. That makes us accessories. And if they get caught, God help us, so do we."
"For years, I was entertained by film-noir homages/parodies like Garrison Keillor's ""Guy Noir, Private Eye"" and the Coens' ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" but I'd never seen an authentic noir. I finally got my chance with ""Double Indemnity,"" which helped establish the genre as we know it. The expected elements are all here: Shadow-filled black-and-white cinematography. An ordinary man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) who becomes an amoral criminal under the influence of a femme fatale (Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck). Abundant cynicism, pessimism, and fatalism. Tough, stylized dialogue, including voice-over narration with a kind of hard-edged poetry to it.However, because in the 21st century we see film noir parodies more frequently than the real thing, we've been conditioned to laugh at some of the excesses of the genre--especially this sort of narration. Thus, lines like ""How could I know that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?"" or ""I got to thinking about what cemeteries are for--they're for putting dead people in!"" strike us as much funnier than they were probably intended to be. Instead of helping create a dark, gritty atmosphere, they actually jolt us out of the movie by prompting our scoffing laughter.In short, ""Double Indemnity"" does a great job of establishing the rules of the world in which the story takes place, but we now have trouble accepting that world on its own terms. And I do believe that this movie was intended to have some humor to it--but of the grimly ironic kind, not the ""isn't this a little ridiculous?"" humor we find in it today.Still, there is much to admire about ""Double Indemnity."" It has a very strong plot--simply but elegantly constructed, and even though its general outlines get revealed within the first five minutes, the movie always remains interesting. The relationship between Walter and Phyllis is intriguingly ambiguous--it's not clear whether they are motivated by lust, greed, or something else entirely. (Roger Ebert's Great Movies essay has some noteworthy theories about this, and made me realize that this ambiguity is an asset, not a flaw.) Most impressive and unexpected is the character of insurance-claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Though Keyes functions like a detective, his role doesn't indulge in any ""film-noir detective"" clichés. Instead, he's the most real-seeming person in the movie: rumpled, gruff, blustering, detail-obsessed, highly conscientious, and very funny. And gradually, the film reveals that the relationship between Walter and Keyes is even more complex and interesting than that between Walter and Phyllis.""Double Indemnity"" will always be watched because of its role in establishing the conventions of film noir, but more importantly, it's still an entertaining movie--even if, sixty years later, it's sometimes entertaining for reasons the filmmakers never intended."
"Barbara Stanwyck changed the trajectory of her career with her ruthless, icy performance here. Fred MacMurray, however, would never again allow himself to duplicate anything similar to Walter Neff's troubled, doomed portrayal again on screen. Playing against their dark alliance, it is left to Edward G. Robinson to win the audience over as he struggles to shed light on the insurance fraud and murder.
This script should be studied by anyone who plans to write for TV or movies. Note the significant changes Wilder and Chandler made from James Cain's original novel - changes Cain admitted were improvements.
Especially worthy of mention is the level of artistry displayed in the final minutes when, after an hour and a half of of bitter nastiness, Wilder gives us just the smallest spoonful of sugar that wraps everything up perfectly. There's almost something criminal when evil is such a treat to watch."
"It was interesting watching this movie having already seen so many movies that clearly used this as source material. The fast talking, witty dialogue, woman with a money making scheme, and the use of romance/feminine wiles to achieve those means are all things that became the cornerstone of film noir. It's easy to see why this movie had such an impact given how perfectly each was executed. It was interesting to watch their so called perfect scheme unfurl bit by bit, especially in regards to how the characters reacted to this. The only thing that I wish is that I had gotten a little more invested in the romance and the characters themselves. Some later film noir films really nailed making me care about the plot through the eyes of the characters, which is my favorite approach to film. That is just my personal preferences though, and setting that aside, this was an incredibly well constructed film."
"Author James M. Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra-tough, sin-blackened, and sex-drenched novels--and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist. The result was three of the most famous films of that decade: MILDRED PIERCE, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Although POSTMAN is probably the better film, INDEMNITY is the most famous--possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.Like POSTMAN, INDEMNITY offers the story of a married woman who plots with her lover to murder her husband. Given MacMurray's typically ""good guy"" image, I didn't expect to believe him in the role of Walter Neff in the role of skirt-hungry Walter Neff--but MacMurray's performance is exceptionally good here, and all the more effective because it so completely unexpected. But while MacMurray has most of the screen time, it is really Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson who dominate the film. Stanwyck is truly memorable here, and gives us a woman who seems at once sexed-up and completely frigid, at once completely natural and absolutely artificial. It is a remarkable and often disturbing effect. Robinson, who endured decades of type-casting, is equally good as the blustery, slightly comic, and absolutely honest insurance man whose job it is to ferret out suspicious claims; it is largely due to his performance, which gives the film a moral center, that we are able to buy into the otherwise off-beat performances that drive the action.This was one of director Billy Wilder's first major hits, and he deserves considerable credit for making the weird elements of the story work as a whole, keeping the film smartly paced, and heaping it up with atmosphere. So influential that its impact would be difficult to over-estimate, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a touchstone for the entire film noir genre. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"This is a dynamite piece of filmmaking by Billy Wilder.  Wilder is in my opinion a very underrated director, much like John Houston.  The acting is in top form from all of the players.  The cinematography is crisp, and beautiful.  The sound is nice and clear, and the direction is arguably some of Wilder's best.  However, the real star is the screenplay.  First off, it was taken from excellent source material.  James Cain is always great for a story where nobody wins out.  Check out The Postman Always Rings Twice for an example.  But it is Chandler who I think really put this one on the map. Chandler has a way with dialogue that makes it all ring in your ears.  The lines are smooth, and the characters always say something that makes me wish I could be that clever and smooth in everyday situations.  Chandler knows dialogue, Chandler knows LA, and Chandler knows how to deliver a story. Check out any of his novels, and you will see this.  This is a teamup that I really wish would have happened again.  Oh well.  If you don't mind voice over narration, then this is a film for you."
"I'm not sure I can think of any new original praise for this film. All I can say is that the suspenseful twists and turns of the the classic film-noir plot and the moral ambiguity of Walter and Phyliss brought to life by truly memorable performances by MacMurray and Stanwyck (and Robinson in his key supporting role as Keys) left an indelible mark on my cinema mad mind even before I had become aware of the film's deserved legendary reputation. When I think of this film, I think of Proverbs 5:3-5 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell."
"Walter Neff is an insurance salesman who meets the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson and falls madly in love with her. Together they hatch a scheme to forge a life insurance policy on Phyllis' husband and then bump him off. The plan seems perfect, but once the deed is done Walter's nerves start to fail him and a cunning fraud investigator at his office begins to dig a little too close to the truth ...Billy Wilder's career was just a bit too acclaimed and strewn with accolades for me, but this classic adult film noir is deserving of all the praise it receives. The script, by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is a dazzling adaptation of James M. Cain's pulp fiction classic. The murder sequence is both exhilarating in its detail and chilling in its realism - these are not gangsters or psychopaths, but ordinary people who do something monstrous borne out of lust and greed. Both MacMurray and Stanwyck (despite a silly blonde wig) give career-best performances which are charming, dazzling, amusing and chilling, all at the same time. Stanwyck is the ultimate cold-hearted femme-fatale (just pipping Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth in my opinion), and right from the moment she first appears (dressed only in a bath-towel), she eats up the screen. MacMurray is brilliant as Neff; a sap, but not a fool, who learns all too late he doesn't have what it takes to be a killer, and that women are never quite what they seem. Both are surpassed however by old pro Robinson as the wily claims investigator, who can smell a phoney setup a mile away. Robinson is amazing; a man for whom facts and statistics are never wrong and rule human nature, at least when it comes to money - a sad but profound truth. Equally good is the extremely dark photography by John Seitz (see also Sullivan's Travels, This Gun For Hire, Invaders From Mars and many others), with daring foreground shadows (Neff looking out his apartment window), stunning use of closeups (the big one of Phyllis while the dirty deed is being done) and many rule-breaking moments (when the husband is talking and signing the forms the focus should be on him, but it's on Phyllis). Best of all is Chandler's ricochet dialogue, which revs up the frisson and tumbles crookedly out of the actors. There are too many classy lines to mention, but my favourite is when Phyllis says, ""I wonder if I know what you mean."", and Walter hits back with, ""I wonder if you wonder."". Although movie adaptations of Dashiel Hammett's books kick-started this genre (The Thin Man, The Glass Key, The Maltese Falcon), this is the pivotal Hays-Code-ignoring lurid murder potboiler of the forties, followed by such greats as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Deadly Is The Female/Gun Crazy and D.O.A. (and later Blood Simple and Red Rock West). This is a stylish, extremely well acted movie of a great book, and a real treat for all fans of classic crime fiction."
"Spoilers hereinDouble Indemnity is another piece of classic film noir with all the classic elements of mystery, plotting, femme fatales and snappy dialogue. I just finished watching it and I have to say it's possibly the best I've seen.Not only is it a beautifully and craftily worked noir story but also a complex fable about greed and revenge, remorse and regret. From the moment it starts you know it's going to hit you, and it certainly does.Fred MacMurray plays insurance salesman Walter Neff, who relates the story to us by leaving a memo for his claims manager Keyes, played by Edward G Robinson. His intermittent voiceovers take the guise not only of the narrator but also of Neff's conscience as he retells the story of his involvement in the murder of his client Dietrichson after he plotted with Dietrichson's wife. They thought it would be the perfect murder, but as Keyes so rightly points out, no murder is perfect. It comes undone sooner or later, and when there's two people involved, usually sooner. Particularly in this case as Mrs Dietrichson and Neff begin to plot against each other. It becomes less about claiming the insurance money and more about which one, if either, gets away with the murder.As you can tell from my clearly blithering attempt to ruin the plot, it's a fantastic film. You come away from it and you want to ruin the ending for someone else because it's just so exciting. Billy Wilder directs with absolute precision, he blends perfectly the romance, frequent suspense, and dramatic irony dispersed throughout the film in absolute drones. The fact that Neff is present in all but one of the scenes in the film is a constant reminder of the irony of the story, the fact that he is involved on all sides and in all facets of the plot.Barbara Stanwyck also plays one of the best femme fatales I've ever seen on screen, it's not only a masterful performance but a masterful character in itself. The success of this film owes a lot to both her performance and the way the script works her in. Fred MacMurray is occasionally overly winsome at the start of the film, however, he definitely pulls his performance together at the end and it is not enough to detract entirely from the overall effect.A crafty, enjoyable and suspenseful film noir filled with anti-heroes, mystery, morals, and just good all-round entertainment. Not quite perfect but about as close as it can come. ****1/2 / *****"
"Woody Allen once called ""Double Indemnity"" the finest American movie ever made. That may be going out on a limb a bit, but then again Allen is more than a film-maker. He is a historian, a listener, a writer and a supreme judge of movies. While I am not going to agree that this is the finest movie ever produced in the U.S., I am still going to say that this is easily one of the very best films ever conceived and executed through the history of motion pictures. An insurance man (Fred MacMurray) goes to renew an automobile policy for the ridiculously wealthy Tom Powers. Instead of finding his man though he meets Powers' super-wicked and highly sexual wife (Barbara Stanwyck, in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated part). They flirt immediately. There is something more than friendship there and a crazed affair starts. Stanwyck, a master manipulator tells sob stories to MacMurray about her abusive husband (embellishing quite a bit in the process). MacMurray, only having eyes for Stanwyck, comes up with a plan with her to have Powers killed so they can collect the insurance via the titled policy. Naturally though Stanwyck does not think near as much of the relationship as MacMurray does and the duo must constantly dodge pesky insurance investigator Edward G. Robinson (in one of his finer roles) and Stanwyck's suspicious step-daughter (Jean Heather). All told through intense flashbacks by MacMurray, ""Double Indemnity"" is quite possibly co-writer/director (Oscar-nominated in both categories) Billy Wilder's finest contribution to the cinema. As time passes, many film scholars confuse this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's productions. Looking back, this is a very odd movie for Wilder (considering latter triumphs with movies like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Stalag 17"", ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Apartment""). However Wilder would continue a similar trend immediately following this in 1945 with the Best Picture Oscar-winning ""The Lost Weekend"", an intense character-study of one man's (Ray Milland) bout with alcoholism. ""Double Indemnity"" has nothing wrong with it. I cannot think of one negative throughout the film. I never found Stanwyck very attractive, but she has a way about her that makes her deceptively sexy here. MacMurray, one of those actors who never got any credit, does probably his best work ever in this one and Robinson is his usual dominant, scene-stealing self. Wickedly brilliant, fun to watch, dramatic, darkly comical, superbly written and flawlessly directed, ""Double Indemnity"" is one of those movies that should be embraced by all fans of the national and international cinema. 5 stars out of 5."
"I was impressed by the subtle changes Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder worked on Cain's novella. The book DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a fast, slick morality piece wherein an amoral hero (""Walter HUFF"") callously disregard notions of Good and Evil, only to find that Evil does exist (The things he discovers about Phyllis Dietrichson's past carry quite a shock.. and were omitted from the film.)and that he is sleeping with it. The ending is literally hellish and obviously influenced writers like Jim Thompson.The film, on the other hand, discards this to play up a love story between Edward G. Robinson and Fred MacMurray. Their mutual respect at the beginning of the film has turned into sad affection by the end, when Robinson lights MacMurray's cigarette, Fred says, ""...It was right across the desk from you,"" Ed answers, ""Closer than that, Walter,"" and Fred replies, ""I love you, too."" Tellingly, the exchange doesn't seem gay, just the expression of feelings between two men. Chandler knew how to write this and Wilder knew how to film it -- and very well indeed."
"What many call the ultimate film noir, the murder mystery that is spoiled at the start, setting the stage for a retelling by our protagonist of the perfect crime, is unraveled before our eyes. Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.It is not giving away anything to say that the two complete the task of killing Mr. Dietrichson, a businessman with a temper. The deed is orchestrated to look like he fell off a train, a venue for accidental death that comes with a special double indemnity clause, one that pays twice the cost of his recently purchased insurance of $50,000. That money is the impetus that pushes Neff over the top to help his new mistress. Phyllis Dietrichson is the damsel in distress, the nurse of her husband's first wife that was naïve and heartbroken for her boss after his loss. She says it compelled her to stay with him in a union that never held any love. The chance arrival of Neff not only opens her eyes to the possibility of a clean break without any strings and actually some cash to boot, but also to a man she can spend time and possibly settle down with. It is a strange coincidence that the Dietrichson's auto insurance was allowed to lapse, creating a house call, and a happy accident that the man called to visit was one as immoral as Walter. Right from the start he flirts and makes advances towards the woman he knows is married to his client. It's not until the end that you start to consider whether none of it was by chance at all, but instead carefully planned out and manipulated from the first second.Neff is played by Fred MacMurraya perfect fit for the role of a shady salesman, unafraid to get his hands dirty. The confidence and swagger allow us to believe he can win over the girl as easily as he does. He is the kind of guy that can fool the world into thinking he is on the level, a man of intelligence and pride. His boss, Barton Keyes and he have a very close relationship, one based on mutual respect and admiration. Neff has them all fooled into believing he is a man of character, one Keyes would personally vouch for, and his initial balk at the offer to help kill Dietrichson shows that maybe he is. Maybe there is some semblance of humanity behind the quick-witted banter and devious smile, a moral compass that won't allow him to cross the line. But greed and lust can tempt even a saint, let alone a guy like Neff, and it doesn't take long for him to begin the blueprints for what will be the perfect crime; one that not even Keyes and his keen lie detector can spot. It is that question of virtue that will ultimately undo him, though, as the strong stomach he thought he had might not be indestructible.The story revolves around MacMurray and as a result he is on screen almost the entire time. He is our narrator and our entrance point into the proceedings. However, it is not a role that we necessarily relate to, nor even begin to feel sorry for to hope he gets away with the crime. Instead, knowing about his confession from the beginning, we sit down to watch his hubris shred his world to pieces. Each person is a cog to the tale at hand; it is the plotting of the film that takes center stage and top billing. The pieces are moved and we follow them through the twists and turns and revelations that change our preconceptions of each. No one is truly as they seem and they all have an ulterior motive just below the surface, propelling their actions and attempts for survival whether the other does or not. Our two criminals are selfish at heart, but until you watch the entire journey, you won't know just how much.While the acting is definitely dated and a product of its time, it doesn't mean that it's not good. Barbara Stanwyck plays MacMurray's partner-in-crime Phyllis with equal panache. She holds her own in every situation, whether with her sharp tongue in some very funny back and forths or in her steely disposition when things get rough, it's a part that needs to be strong and is. Barton Keyes is the role that sticks with you, though. Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the cocky claims agent, self-proclaimed as never being wrong when his gut says something isn't right. He delivers some of the best lines with such deadpan seriousness that you laugh even harder. The ego, cynicism, and attitude all add up to a man you have to respect, because under the tough exterior lies a man with heart. His dynamic with MacMurray is an interesting one, especially when seen through to the end. While they aren't completely fleshed out, each character is a detailed piece to the intricate web of deceit on display. Surrogates for the story to be shown to the audience, we watch them not for who they are, but for what they will do."
"Barbara Stanwyck (multi bw movies ""Lady Eve"", many others) and Fred MacMurray (also many bw movies, then the dad on My Three Sons TV series) meet as an insurance salesman attempts to sell an insurance policy to a California housewife. They both play dark, sinister roles, unlike what they are both known for. I love the playful banter as they flirt and tease each other before things get more serious. Plot also has several clever twists, and the viewer squirms several times when the investigators almost catch people in compromising positions in a Hitchcock manner. Edward Robinson is MacMurray's boss helping to track down the clues. Billy Wilder directed. Movie was remade later in 1973 with richard crenna, but stick with the old b/w version."
"James M. Cain's 'Double Indemnity' is one greatest crime stories ever written. It's not even novel length, only 80 pages or so, but close to perfect. I approached the movie version with some trepidation. I was aware that it was regarded as a film noir classic, and Billy Wilder is a great director, but I was put off by the casting of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in the lead roles. I grew up watching endless re-runs of 'My Three Sons' on TV so MacMurray was the last person I could imagine to play tough guy insurance salesman Walter Neff, and Stanwyck is one golden age actress I've never warmed to, and I don't think she was anywhere near as seductive enough to play Phyllis. However I needn't have worried, both actors are excellent, and screen legend Edward G. Robinson steals every scene he is in. A few things were changed from Cain's original novella by Wilder and collaborator Raymond Chandler, especially the ending, which is nowhere near as dark and pessimistic as the book version, but I have no complaints, as a movie it is close to perfect. 'Double Indemnity' is without doubt one of the best crime movies I've ever seen, up there with 'Rififi', 'Out Of The Past', 'The Killing', and a handful of others. Highly recommended."
"Walter Neff, an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) and Phyllis Dietrichson, an unhappy wife (Barbara Stanwyck) set up a (near) perfect insurance scam in this genre classic. The story by director Billy Wilder and crime-novelist Raymond Chandler is clever, with a well thought-out and executed plan with just enough weaknesses to ignite suspicions in Walter's boss, insurance investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). MacMurray (a boomer icon in ""My Three Sons"" (1960)) plays against type as weak-willed but cunning and duplicitous Neff, infatuated with Stanwyck's peroxide blond temptress. The film was an award winner despite being considered sordid by some critics and was famously boycotted by singer Kate Smith. Unmissable by noir fans and a good evening's entertainment for anyone else."
"Double Indemnity is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-adapts the screenplay with Raymond Chandler from the novella written by James M. Cain. It stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by John F. Seitz.For a film lover such as myself it feels redundant writing a review for Double Indemnity, because quite simply there's nothing to say that hasn't been said already. The esteem it is held in is justified, it's a razor sharp noir across the board and can be put up as one of the classic noir era pictures that got lovers of the form interested in the first place.Based around the infamous Snyder/Gray case of 1927, Wilder and Chandler fill the story with a sinister cynicism that is palpable in the extreme. With a script positively pumped with hard boiled dialogue, a simple case of murder becomes so much more, a labyrinth of devious cunning and foolishness, with a trio of top performances crowning this topper.Technically via aural and visual work the story gains extra spice. Rosza provides a score that frays the nerves, imbuing the sense of doom and edginess required for plotting. Seitz excels, the photography a trademark for noir, heavy shadows, abrupt camera angles and menacing shards of light come to the fore.And to top it all off, it gets away with so much, a real censorship baiter. The story takes a journey to the dark side of morality, and the makers, bless them for they know what they do, gleefully tease the production code to give film noir fans a reason to rejoice.Quintessential stuff. 10/10"
"people who best remember fred macmurray from my three sons will certainly be caught off guard wiith this classic  james m. cain film noir flick. macmurray plays a cool, sleazy, somewhat desperate conniving dupe, while barbara stanwyck plays the femme fatale, and edward g. robinson does a fine job in a somewhat subdued role. a must see!"
"Spoilers herein.Filmviewing is like most things in life: there are a few predefined roles among which it is convenient to pick. Once you define who you are in the world of cinema, it determines a lot of what you think about what you have just experienced. One of these roles is the type who by watching a film becomes part of its original audience, or rather a stylized nostalgic notion of what that audience was. Thus the film is a mere trigger, not necessarily important itself. There seem to be lots of these, people who consider this film as not only enjoyable, but the apogee of film noir, which itself is (in this view) the most movie-like of movies. Noir, romances and musicals attract these folks, as do legendary celebrities.You may be one of these types, but I am not. I expect the film to transport me to its own world, not the world of original viewers. As a noir classic, it fails for me. I do think the dictaphone framing is very effective, and the thumblighting of the matches. Also of historical note is the then odd perspective on the detective form: at the beginning you know who did it. You soon learn why. How isn't very interesting. The way the detective gets the scent is purely conventional, but the focus on the hapless perpetrator was relatively novel in its time. The game is one of following this hapless goof through his ensnarement in forces beyond his control. His strong (and we learn misplaced) cockiness, apparent through the aggressive banter is the stylistic spice that is supposed to carry the notion.But that device is pretty thin stuff. And except for the dictaphone bits, the dialog and acting are poor by conventional standards. Stanwyck isn't seductive or particularly deep. I fail to see how the lighting could be considered masterful, when so many other noir masters are around. `Touch of Evil' is excessive, but that's the point with noir -- at least noir that works today.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."
"If you haven't seen this movie yet, go out and buy it or rent it, you will not be disappointed. If you don't know much about movies and need to learn what movie Buffs consider as some of the best Movie classics of all time, then look no further then these, Double Indemnity,Citizen Kane,Sunset Boulevard,Out of the Past,Criss Cross,The Asphalt Jungle,Vertigo,Witness for the Prosecution,North by Northwest,Gaslight,The Good,the Bad and the Ugly,Cape Fear and All About Eve. Double Indemnity is the King of all 1940's crime melodramas, told in a flashback style. A urban crime dramas in which a greedy, weak man, Fred MacMurry, is seduced and trapped by a cold, evil woman. Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck, seduces the insurance agent Walter Neff Fred MacMurray into murdering her husband to collect his accident policy. Of course things turn out differently and things are not all as they seem. Chilling ending to an unforgettable movie."
"This is a good film noir movie that is compelling to watch and leaves you thinking. I watched this film first in my film studies class at college and i thought when it came on ""oh no"" black and white its going to be boring but the fact is that it wasn't, the incredible storyline alone is so interesting the actors especially Fred Mac Murray are excellent picking Mac Murray out in particular a slick cool insurance salesman who is a bit of a womanizer!!.I did however think that they would have got away with that kind of murder, i really think it would have been hard to find out the exact details of that case and then find the murderer or murderers. The film on a whole reminds me of The Godfather or an old classic murder drama, the dark rooms the fast New York accent talk and the fascinating dress sense (not to mention the way Neff can light a match like that so slick)!! Overall a very enjoyable film for anyone of any age, it will not offend anyone and is one classic that must be seen9/10"
"This film is not a timeless epic, it has aged badly. One whom describes it as a must for film-noir fans is probably doing so for all the wrong reasons. Sure, it has a snappy dialogue, the dame is desirable, the hero both lovable due to his sentimentalism, and exciting due to his high intelligence, the narration is very well done. The acting is not, contrary to popular opinion, that good. The main characters were not so hot, the best piece of acting was actually the portrayal of Keys, his character was almost Holmes-esque. The plot is very generic. Of course, this film may well have been one of the first to carry out such a plot, it may have been a real trend-setter, but I'm sorry that doesn't make it a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Regardless of how it received and how influential it was, it is not a great in its own genre. I adore film-noir and found this a let down."
"In 1943, director of the film, ""Double Indemnity"", Billy Wilder, was painstakingly determined to complete a motion picture about this compelling novel written by James M. Cain. Cain is known for other great novels such as ""Mildred Pierce"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"". In the process of creating this major motion picture, several actors, including George Raft and Alan Ladd, turned down the job as the sinister leading male role in this movie. Finally, the part was offered to squeaky clean, Fred MacMurray, this appointment is literally, out of character for MacMurray! Barbara Stanwyck received the honor for the lead female role in ""Double Indemnity"", and Edward G Robinson was given the third billing as a star in this picture. This post of third billing was something that had not happened to Edward G Robinson since his prior acting days before ""Little Caeser"", which was made in 1931. Robinson capitulated to a third billing spot because he had a great admiration for the concept that the film ""Double Indemnity"" so intricately purported! The whole genre to ""Double Indemnity"" was set up flawlessly, as it orchestrated a deliberately contradictory dynamic. Behind the sunny pleasantry of Los Angeles, there lurked a deep rooted and conniving chicanery amidst a couple of masterminds who began implementing a horribly dark aspect of human behavior. The film, ""Double Indemnity"" manifested the rough exterior that the United Staes was besieged with because of their involvement in World War II. The American movie goer had become a little less naive since the advent of WWII, and, this reflected itself accordingly with regards to the type of movie they wanted to see. The film noir captivated the American public, and, now, the movie industry encompassed a myriad of wry depictions that were germane to the pejorative side of an individual. This dubiously sensationalistic technique by the motion picture industry was perceived as intriguing by the newly enlightened movie audience of the early 1940's!! The film ""Double Indemnity"" epitomizes the entire film noir pique, right alongside with the uncanny masterpiece ""Maltese Falcon"". ""Double Indemnity"" did not win for best picture in 1944, that year, the Academy Award was given to ""Going My Way"". As we all know, there are times when life simply does not make any sense, especially since a prominent Philadelphia critic rated ""Going My Way"" the worst Academy Award winning film in the whole history of the American cinema! ""Double Indemnity"" is considered to be Billy Wilder's best directing effort! The next year, Billy Wilder's directorial ability was totally vindicated, as he received his rightfully deserved acclaim with the film, ""The Lost Weekend"", which won for best picture in 1945. Billy Wilder received the Academy Award for best director that year as well. The film, ""Double Indemnity"" is truly remarkable!! The itemized and avaricious intensity to this movie was something that had not been depicted in films before the movie ""Double Indemnity"" was made. This film's wiles of malice and deceit were not expedited with a derivative and visceral disposition, rather, these antics were carried off with a dedicated fervor and paramount gratification. Fred MacMurray's character was perpetually afflicted with a relentless angst that infiltrated an acrimonious reveille to him about the primary repercussions of personal greed! His character, Walter Neff, endured a narrative agony which perpetuated a compulsive pontification about how people really are, as opposed to the way they are suppose to be! Barbara Stanwyck established her formidable status as a revolutionary femme-fatal in the Hollywood world of movies, with her performance in ""Double Indemnity"". Charismatically charming while wearing her diverse onslaught of angora sweaters, her beauty and allure became a necessary ingredient to the making of this film! The wig that Barbara Stanwyck wore for this movie, signified the overall mendacity to her heinously lethal and obsessive persona!! Stanwyck's intellectual ambiguity to this role was attributed to her overtly callous set of pecuniary priorities! Edward G. Robinson's character was the perennial voice of reason. Robinson was the legal eagle who would ultimately prevail in his tenacious quest to resolve all of these dubiously manufactured and felonious escapades! The final scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was an all-time noir classic. This last scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was one of the best scenes of any movie whatsoever, definitely head to head with the extraordinary last scene of the movie ""The Killing"". A respected production company ranks this ending the sixth best ending of any and all movies ever produced! The dramatic ending to ""Double Indemnity"" was rated right above ""Casablanca"" and right below ""City Lights"". The heightened glamor to the final scene for MacMurray and Stanwyck exuded a zenith within the realm of the classic film noir mystique. The emphatic, yet subtle, overtone to the song ""Tangerine"" playing in the background, became a melodic element to this final scene which was conducive to a sexually sedate form of apocalyptic doom and despair! Throughout the entire duration of this movie, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were always seducing each other with salacious innuendos! This ending wound up emulating a philosophical perspective used by writers of ancient Greek tragedies! Filming a movie in black and white is primarily advantageous to the quality of a film, as it obviates any disorientation to the impact of the characters' emotions!! AFI (AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE) ranks ""Double Indemnity"" the 29th best film out of the top 100 American movies ever made! This website ranks ""Double Indemnity"" 53rd out of the top 250 films ever produced. Last, but certainly not least, America's Writer's Guild East, ranks ""Double Indemnity"" the 26th best written script ever in the history of American films!! The director, Billy Wilder, does a tremendous job with consummating the aggregate megalomania and rancor to this movie. The acting was sensational. ""Double Indemnity"" was up for seven Academy Awards in 1944! Without question! ""Double Indemnity"" is one of the greatest films ever created... FIVE STARS... PERFECT TEN!!!!"
"Billy Wilder's cynical self came to public attention in this classic noir film about a luckless insurance salesman and one coldhearted dame. Double Indemnity skirted the very edges of Code morality and it took years before someone brought James M. Cain's novel to the screen.According to a book on Billy Wilder the casting of Barbara Stanwyck was a must for Phyllis Dietrichson, otherwise the film might never have been made. Barbara Stanwyck was that rarest of players, one who could be good and convincing in all kinds of parts. Look at the films she got her four Oscar nominations besides Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, Ball of Fire, and Sorry Wrong Number. Not one of those is similar to any one of the others and Stanwyck was acclaimed in all of them.Fortunately for Wilder and for Paramount's budget, their leading man was right on the lot. Fred MacMurray who has been playing comedic foils for folks like Carole Lombard, Claudette Colbert, etc. up to that time, made the most of playing the feckless Walter Neff who gets sucked into a homicidal scheme through passion.Double Indemnity is a landmark film in that it's two leads are really rotten people. Barbara Stanwyck has a husband in Tom Powers she can't stand and would like to bump him off for an insurance settlement and MacMurray's the insurance salesman she beguiles into her plot. Funny thing is that when the mechanics of the murder plot are discussed and formulated, the ideas are all MacMurray's. Billy Wilder made two other films similar to Double Indemnity where a weak protagonist gets caught up in a filthy scheme. In Sunset Boulevard William Holden plays the gigolo way to well and can't break from unto pain of death. And Kirk Douglas's scheme about exploiting the tragedy of a man trapped in a cave brings him down all the way in Ace in the Hole. I'd be hard pressed to say which of the three men was worse.The man who brings them down is Edward G. Robinson, the claims investigator in the insurance office where MacMurray works. Robinson is gradually putting the whole thing together and Wilder is at his best with the scenes of Robinson explaining the progress of his investigation to MacMurray with Fred trying to stay one step ahead.Robinson doesn't usually get enough praise for Double Indemnity. He's got a little man, Hercule Poirot has those little grey cells. Either way both are up to the challenge of solving what looks like a perfect crime. Lot's of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth in James M. Cain's Barton Keyes.Wilder for the one and only time in his career worked with another great mystery writer in Raymond Chandler on the script. It was not a pleasant experience for either. Chandler complained about the working conditions of Hollywood and Wilder complained about Chandler's dissipation. Both were probably right.Among the supporting cast look for a nice performance by Porter Hall who turns out not to be as valuable witness as Robinson originally thought. The man from Medford may not lie, but he's not above a little chiseling.Double Indemnity is one eternal classic it will be studied and dissected by film students for centuries."
"If you are a fan of the classics, and have not seen this movie, WHY NOT? This truly is one of the great ones. I enjoyed the ""old school"" language in the movie. I think one of my biggest enjoyments was seeing Fred MacMurray as a bad guy. I have seen this guy in many shows and movies as the good guy for many years. The best one in the flick (in my opinion) has got to be Edward G. Robinson, classic, classic indeed."
"It's all story. There's not an ounce of superfluous material anywhere in this tightly plotted film classic about a wealthy middle-aged woman named Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) and an insurance salesman named Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray). The two of them conspire to kill Dietrichson's heavily insured husband, to cheat the insurance company out of a fortune. ""Double Indemnity"" is my all-time favorite noir film.The film's entertainment derives, in part, from the fact that we, as viewers, get to peek into their murderous scheme, and then watch both of them squirm, when their scheme starts to unravel. An undercurrent of paranoia permeates the plot, as the two incessantly look over their shoulders, as it were, to see if anyone has picked up on their plans or actions. And there are plenty of plot twists and turns. The dialogue is brisk, decisive, and memorable. Walter Neff gives one of my favorite lines: ""How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?""The film's excellent structure is organized around Neff's confessional, spoken into a Dictaphone and directed at his insurance company boss, Barton Keyes, played by the inimitable Edward G. Robinson. Much of the story is then told in a series of flashbacks from Neff's POV, as he narrates his liaison with Dietrichson.The film's terrific B&W cinematography, with its use of lighting texture and shadows, adds to the dark mood, and to an overall feeling of danger and deception. The visuals neatly correspond to the inner lives of the two main characters. The film's direction and casting are perfect. All of the acting is top notch. And the score is edgy, erotic, and at times appropriately menacing.There are a few minor plot holes. But who cares? The concept, story, characters, structure, and dialogue are so cinematically strong that they overwhelm any slight defects. And with topnotch film direction, casting, acting, cinematography, editing, and score, the result is a powerhouse film that will entertain viewers for at least the next ten thousand years."
"For me, Wilder is somewhat of a hit-or-miss affair. I cannot get enough of SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950), truly a one-of-a-kind film, that seems to get richer with each passing year. LOST WEEKEND (1945) also holds up very well to this day-and-age, but few of his other films did. But this campy piece of murder, double-crossing and intrige by Wilder, I never cared for. The set-up? $50,000. Insurance policy. Double crossing. Adultery. Murder. Und so weiter, und so weiter... the usual noir ingredients. Watching this sixty years later, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck strutting their way through the now utterly familiar noir plot line, whispering seductive lines too each other, it's non-too-exciting anymore. Probably a victim of its own success, but anyone getting excited over the plot hasn't lived the last sixty years, so what is it that's still appealing? The dialog? Stanwyck? Edward G. Robinson? I never understood what the appeal of Barbara Stanwyck was. In THE LADY EVE (1941) I positively loathed her brooding persona, she had zero sex appeal. She just annoys the hell out of me, I can't help it. There's also something about MacMurray's continuous voice-over makes that makes me fall asleep each time I see this. It probably has something to do with the timbre in his voice. I never even managed to watch this in one stretch. Camera Obscura --- 4/10"
"The premier ""film noir"" entrée, DOUBLE INDEMNITY stands as the model for the genre. Told entirely in flashback, it is the grim, yet seductive story of a life insurance agent who falls for a treacherously sultry married woman plotting to do her husband in for the payoff. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is nothing less than a requirement for anyone who asks, ""What is film noir?"" For all the ingredients are present: the cold-hearted criminal plot, the adulterous romance, the step-by-step implementing of the deed, the anxiety-ridden moments as a steadfast mind zeroes in on the guilty parties, and the inevitability of the final justice---all filmed in grim black and white.Did Fred MacMurray ever have a greater moment in his acting career playing Walter Neff, the Los Angeles insurance agent knocked out by a bored housewife who ropes him into her diabolical web? Did Barbara Stanwyck ever really overcome the powerful persona of Mrs. Dietrichson, the calculating murderess standing at the top of the stairs in a bath towel? And could there have been a better screen writer for DOUBLE INDEMNITY than the assiduous Raymond Chandler (THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, THE LONG GOODBYE), who remains the unequaled master of the Los Angeles detective genre? Not to be outdone, Edward G. Robinson turns in a yeoman's performance as Keyes, MacMurray's boss. Keyes is a walking encyclopedia of fraudulent insurance claims and is nearly infallible in his ability to sniff out the rotten stench of not-so-accidental death. In one memorable scene, Keyes reduces his own superior to pulp as he lectures him that ""no one ever committed suicide by throwing themselves off a train moving at 5 miles per hour."" He cites the statistics of death by poisoning, drowning, lightning strikes, and electrocution straight off the top of his head. At what point Keyes becomes suspicious of Neff is never quite clear; but he is certainly suspicious of Stanwyck from the start--and Neff had taken Stanwyck's life insurance policy just before her husband supposedly went off the caboose.One certain proof that a detective drama is succeeding is the identification the audience has with the villains. A cold-blooded murder has been committed, yet we somehow squirm nervously for the perpetrators hoping their plot succeeds. The epitome of this identification occurs in the scene after Neff impersonates Dietrichson on the train. MacMurray races back to the car where Stanwyck awaits and the car engine stalls. He tries to turn it over again and again. We actually want the car to start! The only soft spot that exists in this sensationally crafted Ramond Chandler script is MacMurray's character transformation. He simply evolves from cavalier life insurance salesman to murderer far too soon after falling for Stanwyck. Moreover, Neff's seemingly air-tight plot to erase Dietrichson materializes a bit too quickly and precisely in his mind. What is central is that in the end it isn't Neff's boss Keyes who throws the light on the murder--it's the adulterous relationship between MacMurray and Stanwyck itself. No one other than the plotters themselves was needed to undo the evil, for the villainous collaboration contained the seeds for its own destruction. In the end, the lovers turn on one another and the twisted relationship destroys both of them. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is simply one of Hollywood's movie detective classics. And anyone who fails to include DOUBLE INDEMNITY in an all-time list of greats knows very little about films.Dennis Caracciolo"
"Interesting plot of this thriller. An attractive woman (Stanwyck) married to a man much older than her, who was previously married or was widow, with a daughter from his first marriage, live in a very tense relations. She did not want to continue living with his husband and detested his daughter. At this point, an agent from an insurance company (MacMurray) thrived as an 'angel' for Stanwyck, he proposed different assurances, one of them foresaw insurance in case of an accidental death, but he also felt in love with Stanwyck. This passion led to a planned murder that was committed nearly perfectly. But another intelligent person (Edward G. Robinson), the boss of MacMurray in the insurance company, step by step started to discover the plot for murder. This is a film with very modest means if you compare with those presently in use, but it is of a very high quality. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray showed their class, but the best acting came from that 'monster' of the screen named Edward G. Robinson, who acted perfectly. Looking the way he did one may think that he was not an actor but simply the real boss of the insurance company."
"The classic ""Double Indemnity"" is one of the greatest of all ""film noir"" movies, and it has everything you could ask for: great acting, interesting characters, an imaginative plot, and lots of tension.  Put all this under the direction of the incomparable Billy Wilder, and it's one of the best films of all time.The three lead actors all give terrific performances.  Fred MacMurray is at the center of everything, as an insurance salesman tempted in more than one way by an alluring customer (Barbara Stanwyck).  MacMurray's character is torn between what Stanwyck offers, and his close relationship with his company's claims manager, played by Edward G. Robinson.  MacMurray is excellent in portraying his struggle between his desire to grab the illicit pleasures offered by Stanwyck, and his deep admiration for Robinson as a person and as an example.  Stanwyck in turn is perfect in her role as a woman who uses everything she has to get what she wants.  Robinson's performance may be the best of all in bringing his character to life - a straight-arrow, perceptive and diligent worker who also comes across as a thoroughly enjoyable character.The three leads are so good that the film gets away with some occasionally dated (overly ""hard-boiled"") dialogue in some of the voice-overs and confrontation scenes.  The actors were in such good form, though, that they were able to make any line sound pretty good.The rest of the cast all have much smaller parts, but they all fulfill their functions well, especially Porter Hall in one of his many fine character roles, and Richard Gaines, who is perfect as a clueless insurance company executive.Wilder uses his skilled touch to complete the atmosphere of intrigue and suspense.  The overall result is a great film noir whose characters and tensions are as alive today as they were in the 40's.  It is worth watching over and over."
"Although I enjoyed this movie a lot, I found some interesting flaws in it as well. For instance, Fred MacMurray seemed to try too hard to be a bad guy. I adore Barbara Stanwyck, but who did her hair? It looked like a poorly styled wig. This film certainly was fodder for a Carol Burnett parody, if for nothing else, her hair. The only believable character I found was that of Lola, the victim's daughter. Edward G. Robinson was great, thus I felt that the part was written for him. Now the part of the casual observer on the train from Oregon seemed to be terribly stereotyped, and the racist overtones as with Mr. Galopus and the ""colored woman who comes in twice a week"" didn't excite me either, but I guess that was what it was like in those days.Now for the clipped part. The dialogue seemed very quick and unnatural. It sounded like everyone was reading from the script while they were acting. This may have something to do with Wilder's penchant for ""tight"" scripts, especially in his early films. I must say that he improved later on in such films as ""Sunset Boulevard."" I did enjoy the scenes of Los Angeles in the 1940's though. It's a period piece to be admired."
"*Possible Spoilers!* Released in 1944 - Double Indemnity's story of vicious betrayal may be somewhat flawed and inconsistent - And, its 3 principal actors may have been miscast (especially Barbara Stanwyck as the deceitfully wicked femme fatale in a really cheap-looking wig) - But, overall, it's quite easy to see why this vintage, Hollywood Crime/Drama is considered to be a true ""classic"" of 1940s Film Noir.Containing plenty of loaded dialog, shadowy settings and frequent flashes of well-timed tension, Double Indemnity's story of murder and deception comes together quite nicely like that of a master jigsaw puzzle where all of the scattered pieces of its plot-line eventually become one.Even though I view Double Indemnity as essentially a ""Chick Flick"", its story is told (chiefly in long flashbacks) by a man who was directly involved in this double-crossing crime-of-passion that went seriously haywire.Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an over-confident, yet naively gullible insurance salesman, who, thinking that he's got it all figured out, gets played for an all-time sucker when the seductive, well-to-do Mrs. Dietrichson snares him into a diabolical plot to kill her husband in order to collect $100,000 through the double indemnity clause in his life insurance policy.Needless to say, once Neff gets himself completely tangled up in a web of establishing alibis (while setting the wheels of the ""perfect"" crime into motion), things literally begin to come apart at the seams once he inadvertently learns about the treacherous activities (both past and present) of the calculating and conniving Mrs. Dietrichson.Filmed in glossy b&w, Double Indemnity's story was co-written by the famed crime-novelist, Raymond Chandler. It was directed by Billy Wilder, known for such other notable films as - Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch, and Some Like It Hot."
"No need to recap the plot or echo consensus points.From the minute he sees her slinking down the stairs in that spangled ankle bracelet, he's hooked. Walter Neff's already boarded that long, lonely trolley down the one-way track. Yes indeed, sultry Phyllis appears to be just the ticket he's been looking for. Great noir classic. All in all, Neff should have paid attention to that other member of the oddball triangle. Old man Keyes may be a born cynic, but despite himself, he's a father figure looking for a son to take his place, and warning Neff about the ""Margie's"" of the world. What he doesn't know is that this ""Margie"" definitely doesn't drink out of a bottle. What's more, Neff's already chosen to ride with the flashy crowd, get out of that dumpy apartment, and get into Phyllis's vicious little insurance swindle. As Keyes tellingly remarks, ""You're not smarter than the rest, Walter, just a little taller."" I like to think that Walter finally realizes his folly in that brilliant final scene, even if it is too late. Still, the film's cynical veneer is misleading. Because beneath all the deceits, betrayals, and ironies, lies a lighted match and one of the odder father-son relationships in Hollywood annals."
"Billy Wilder's earlier vintage work, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is an unapologetically thrilling film- noir, without any fluffy fillers, this morally shocking murder tale has justified itself as a textbook exemplar of how cinema is able to be a heavyweight platform to narrate a story, apart from all those auxiliary foils (both visually and sonically), the marrow here is a neat but impeccable script (by Wilder and Raymond Chandler).The impending tragedy has been explicitly unraveled since the very beginning, the storyline starts as a flash-back, our protagonist, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), suffering from a bullet wound in his shoulder, has stated that he neither got the money nor the woman after executed a ruthless murder, then the film jumps to the overture to delve into the details of Walter's fated encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (a gracefully confident Barbara Stanwyck to portray a standard femme-fatale character), as an insurance rep, Walter is smitten with her and assists her to murder her wealthy husband so as to get the so-called ""double indemnity"" insurance compensation. The murder scheme certainly is not the most difficult part, the real challenge is after the evil conduct, in one hand, Walter's super-acute superior Keyes (a bona- fide scene-stealer Edward G. Robinson) who gradually detects the real motive after the presuming accident death; on the other hand, the more devilish past of Phyllis suggests that there is an even bigger conspiracy is under the way.One could never argue that the script is prodigiously witty and most notably is Keyes' eloquence in harnessing his professional intuition (""the little man inside"") to find out the loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases. It's quite unimaginable that Robinson had been snubbed for a supporting acting nomination while the film has acquired 7, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and LEADING ACTRESS (without win though); while MacMurray, had been eluded by the Academy throughout his wholesome career, potentially had delivered his best work in depicting an ambiguous figure with all he had; Stanwyck's role is a tad feeble due to her not-too-copious presence but she is just marvelous to watch with each gesture and expression entangled with her own breed of complexity, but the final convolution of her heartlessness-turns-soft tactic is a self-conscious compromise, woman falls prey of a man's world is just an illusionary chimera, which has been haunting us until this moment and will thrive on and on."
"This is the film that many, including myself, considered should have won the Best Picture award in 1944 over Going My Way, and one of the greatest film noir. After watching it again last week I'd have to agree with many reviewers that the film is still good but is now badly dated, notwithstanding the revolutionary villain/hero narrator technique, as many other noir films of that decade are, while others (Maltese Falcon,Out of the Past, Big Sleep, Mildred Pierce, Lady from Shanghai, The Killers, just to name a few) have not faded as bad. Wilder's 1945 ""The Lost Weekend"" in particular is as harrowing and relevant today as it was in 1945, and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture. Stanwyck, who I found very sexy in other movies (Ball of Fire, e.g) doesn't do a thing for me in this film, not the least because of the ridiculous blonde wig or whatever she had on her head. The scenes in the supermarket and in the back of the train where MacMurray never faces the stranger who offers to get a pack of cigarettes, are very clumsily done. The side stories of the daughter and her boyfriend also don't help. The ending, however, is still very effective today,as are many scenes, most of them involving Edward G. Robinson, who's excellent. Also, the music by Miklos Rosza, who would score many of Wilder's films, is memorable."
"""Double Indemnity"" is a great movie with many great attributes but foremost among these must be its scintillating screenplay which combines wit, intelligence, razor sharp remarks and double entendres in such an effective way that, as well as being immensely entertaining, it also contributes strongly to driving the pace of the story. The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cain's story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay in 1945.The characters featured in this evil tale are very memorable and in the case of the two main protagonists are also very immoral. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a fast talking insurance salesman who goes to visit a client and in his absence meets his wife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Their first encounter during which Dietrichson appears dressed only in a bath towel, leads to some flirting and their relationship develops further when Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to take part in a scheme to sell her husband an accident policy (unknown to Mr Dietrichson) and then to murder him so that the couple can collect the insurance money and enjoy a future together.Neff advises that the policy will pay out double if the fatal accident occurs on a train and so, when Mr Dietrichson is due to go on a business trip, arrangements are made for him to travel by train. Neff carries out the murder and dressed like Mr Dietrichson (complete with crutches) takes his place on the train journey before the couple place the body on the tracks to give the impression that Mr Dietrichson died as the result of an accidental fall from the observation car of the train.After having carried out their plan successfully, the events that follow conspire to introduce a series of complications which lead to the couple losing their trust in each other and also to the movie's dramatic conclusion.Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as the very self assured Neff who's corrupted by lust and a greed for wealth. His portrayal of someone who thinks he knows all the angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start to go wrong is very convincing and Barbara Stanwyck is also excellent as the cold, manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless and seemingly devoid of any human feelings. Edward G Robinson appears in the role of Barton Keyes, a claims investigator who works for the same firm as Neff. Barton is very experienced and incredibly good at his job and possesses a strong instinct which enables him to sense immediately if a claim is likely to be fraudulent. He and Neff enjoy a longstanding friendship which involves a good deal of warmth and mutual respect. Robinson's performance is outstanding as he delivers some super-fast speeches and conveys the nature of his character's idiosyncrasies with great panache.In typical film noir style, the story is told in flashback with Neff's narration providing a particularly matter-of-fact account of what happened. When he says ""I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman"", there's an inherent poignancy in his words but the delivery is completely lacking in any sentimentality or self pity. The same can be said for his remark that ""we did it so that we could be together, but it's tearing us apart"".""Double Indemnity"" is a dark thriller which became the prototype for many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with the same style and impact as the original. Billy Wilder's direction is superb and especially successful in contributing to the high levels of suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout the action. This is a film of rare quality and one that, because of its subject matter, will undoubtedly continue to be a source of great entertainment and fascination for movie lovers for many years to come."
"When we think of film noir, we think of a corrupt and glamorous world of gangsters, cigarettes and femme fatals. We think of shadows of venetian blinds and wide angle close ups. Double Indemnity is one of the best and most known examples of this genre. Billy Wilder is an absolute genius, his stories always unfolding at the right pace, and his way of bringing them to the screen barely ever impeccable.This is the forties cinema. A story of love and betrayal, of manipulation and big money. The story of femme fatal Barbra Stanwick luring poor insurance salesman Walter Niff to kill her husband so they can be together. Stanwick has what it takes to make her character look sexually dangerous and desirable. Niff has the ways and traits to make his character look like a stylish fool. But as far as acting is concerned, both are surpassed by the wonderful Edward G. Robinson, who is extraordinary delivering lines faster than MacMurray can say ""shut up, baby"".This sort of cinema will never age. It will always find a point of relation to today's society. And when it's directed in such a beautiful way, it's little wonder that the noir is so loved and remembered. The mise sn scene is beautiful. MacMurray's and Stanwyck's character are never really portrayed close. Even when they kiss, they are always shot at an awkward angle. When they are in the same frame, Wilder always makes sure that there's something in the way, whether it's a mother and a child in a supermarket, or a fish tank in the study room of the man whose murder is being secretly plotted. This murder plot reaches its height of tension when MacMurray lures Stanwyck's husband to sign a life insurance, as he thinks he is signing an ordinary car one. He is in fact signing his life away.As in too many noirs, though, it pitfalls into the use of voice over. That is forgiven because from the start we know that he is telling Edward G. Robinson the story, speaking into the voice recorder, confessing his crime of passion. It is a film of which we know the ending already. In fact, one of the most interesting things about the film is the way we observe the main character, and the way that we back him up sometimes, only to change our minds other times. Almost every scene is necessary to make up our minds, when really the only good guy is Robinson in the whole movie.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When the murder plot is put in act, from the arrival to the station, to when the car won't start..."
"I can't think of a director that got so many great movies in the different genres as Billy Wilder. In comedy he made the excellent ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Irma la Douce""; he also made the romantic ""Sabrina""; ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Apartment"" and ""The Lost Week-End"" were his contributions to drama; ""Stalag 17"" is a war film; ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a great mystery thriller; all memorable products in the history of Hollywood.With ""Double Indemnity"" he obtained what is probably the ultimate Film Noir. There's not much to add about this extraordinary movie to what I¨ve red here in other comments. Just that I never was a fan of Fred MacMurray and yet I have to admit he does a very good job in this one (perhaps his best ever along with his treacherous and false navy officer in ""The Caine Mutiny"").Billy Wilder was indeed a very talented man as a movie maker and also had an undeniable skill for recognizing a good story when it came his way. One of the great directors ever, no doubt."
"The super deluxe 2-disc DVD edition of the 1944 film noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (DI) rocks! Director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder's flair with suspense and black humor works so perfectly with James M. Cain's novel about adulterous lovers plotting to murder the woman's husband and scam the man's insurance company, that it even improves on the book (which I read years ago). The dark tone and scandalous subject matter freaked out Hollywood so much that it took 9 years to get DI from the printed page to the big screen. Fred MacMurray was the only leading man in Hollywood with the guts to take the role of insurance salesman-turned-murderer Walter Neff, though even MacMurray needed convincing at first. None of the other in-demand male stars of the period wanted Barbara Stanwyck's conniving, money-loving, hubby-offing temptress Phyllis Dietrichson to make a chump out of him on screen. Their loss! (I'd first seen MacMurray when I was a kid. Back then, he was best known to my generation as a Disney movie star and the lovable dad of TV's MY THREE SONS, so it was quite a revelation to me when I saw him playing underhanded types in DI, THE APARTMENT, and THE CAINE MUTINY. MacMurray had more range than he got credit for!) MacMurray and Stanwyck are dynamite in this, one of the most gleefully, unapologetically black-hearted films noir ever made. Their dialogue, especially in the first half of the movie, contains many of my fave movie lines of all time (if I start quoting them all, I'll pretty much be transcribing most of the script). The chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray blazes like the Chicago Fire as the wily, spellbinding Phyllis draws Walter into her web. As Richard Schickel points out in one of the DVD's 2 excellent audio commentaries, Stanwyck's Phyllis is always reacting in the moment, so you never can tell whether she means a word she says, making her all the more fascinating. What cynical Sam Spade says to the equally slippery Brigid O'Shaughnessy in THE MALTESE FALCON could also apply to the quicksilver Phyllis: she's good, awful good! Edward G. Robinson is DI's crabby yet kind-hearted Voice of Reason in his portrayal of Barton Keyes, the Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company's ace Claims Manager. As Keyes, Robinson is irresistible, with his zeal for detail, the ""little man"" in his gut giving him indigestion every time an insurance claim seems fishy, and his gruff affection for Walter. Heck, at times, there's more tenderness between Walter and Keyes than there is between Walter and Phyllis! :-) IMO, the biggest crime in DI was the failure to nominate either of the male leads for an Oscar, especially scene-stealing Robinson, though the Academy was smart enough not to overlook the mesmerizing Stanwyck. (For that matter, Robinson was never nominated for an Oscar for any of his superb performances. He was eventually given one of those special career Oscars, or as we like to call them, the ""Yikes, He's So Old He Could Croak Any Minute and He Still Hasn't Gotten An Oscar? *D-OH!*"" award. :-) DI boasts plenty of wonderful character bits, too -- really, there isn't a bum performance in the bunch! Our household's DI faves include Fortunio Bonanova as Garlopis, whose phony claim Keyes chews to bits ""like a slice of rare roast beef;"" and Porter Hall as Jackson from Medford, Oregon, the jovial train traveler who innocently throws a wrench into the murder plot when he turns up on the train's Observation Car while Walter pretends to be Phyllis' injured, crutch-bound hubby. (Speaking of the crutches, is the opening credit sequence with the silhouetted, fedora'd figure on crutches one of the coolest credit sequences of all time, or what?). Any fans of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD who might be reading this shouldn't blink when Walter lets Lola (Jean Heather) into his office at one point, or you'll miss Douglas Spencer (with hair!) as Walter's associate, Lou Schwartz, coming out at the same time.If you love the movie (and why wouldn't you? :-), you'll go gaga over the nifty commentary tracks and extras. Among other things, we learn about the censorship issues in bringing Cain's juicy, lurid tales to the big screen. For example, there were several European film versions of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE (including Luchino Visconti's OSSESSIONE, which works very well in its down-to-earth way and recently turned up on Turner Classic Movies) before Hollywood brought it to the big screen with John Garfield and Lana Turner in 1946. We're also told about how the different writing/working styles of Wilder and Raymond Chandler (who was hired to help adapt the story when Cain was under contract elsewhere and Wilder's then-collaborator Charles Brackett nixed the dark material) turned the experience into a collaboration made in hell. For the record, I wouldn't be surprised if Chandler was mostly to blame, since there are similar stories about him being just as tough to work with during Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 screen adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Hitch eventually brought in Ben Hecht's assistant Czenzi Ormonde to finish/polish the script when Chandler took a hike. Disc 2 contains the 1973 TV movie remake of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, which is worth watching if only to appreciate how much better the original is! This DVD set belongs in your collection!"
"This is my favorite movie. I think Fred MacMurray gives his best performance ever. Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson also stand out. The script, co-written by the film's director, Billy Wilder, and mystery author Raymond Chandler is crisp and tough. MacMurray's lines are memorable.It is a story of greed, fear and lust. Greed so intense that it drives the mild-mannered MacMurray to murder. And fear, grasping at his senses, that it permeates his ability to think reasonably. And, of course, lust, the kind of lust for the equally bad Stanwyck that drove him to commit evil in the first place.If you like old films, especially film noir, see this one. It is absolutely perfect."
"A regular reviewer would get into the heavy details of the plot of Billy Wilder's `Double Indemnity', but I wont, because I feel that a film like this should be viewed by someone who knows practically nothing of the plot, so every scene can be a surprise.  What I will say about the plot, just so you have an idea if you don't already know, is that insurance salesman Neff (Fred MacMurray) and his client Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck) have a criminal plot to carry out, and claims man Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is onto them.The movie is a Film-Noir, a terrific B&W genre that died out, I guess, in the early sixties.  Sure, Noirs are still being made today, but those ones are more of a homage to the classic Film-Noirs of the thirties, forties and fifties.  `Double Indemnity' was released in 1944, when Film-Noir was at its prime, with releases like `The Maltese Falcon' right behind it and `The Third Man' just ahead.  To me, `Double Indemnity' is the greatest.It's hard to differentiate Noirs from the regular crime or mystery movies of the past, but I think Roger Ebert said it best in his review for `Out of the Past': `The noir hero is doomed before the story begins -- by fate, rotten luck, or his own flawed character. Crime movies sometimes show good men who go bad. The noir hero is never good, just kidding himself, living in ignorance of his dark side until events demonstrate it to him.'  That character in `Double Indemnity' is Neff, a man who thinks he's carrying out Phyllis' plan because of his love for the woman, but indeed is not.  He likes the plan, he likes doing it, just for the sake of carrying out the evil deed.Phyllis shares his love for the dark, and the evil scheme is the basis of their relationship.  They are never seen talking about anything but the plan, they don't want to, instead of being in love with each other they're in evil with each other.And then there's Keyes, a man who's life has been consumed by his profession so much so that he once dumped his fiancée because he found out about some sketchy business from her past, he says.  But he is a great man, strong willed and smarter than any other man working at his firm, including his boss.  When his boss asks the wrong question he flares into a huge speech about why the question is ludicrous, and why the boss is unfit for his profession.  Sure, he's rambling, but he has the right to, he's the cleverest claims man you'll ever find.So the better part of the movie is about Neff avoiding and out-maneuvering Keyes, a situation which generates such heated suspense, on account of both the actors and Billy Wilder's expert direction and script (co-written by Raymond Chandler).  MacMurray is perfect as the everyman with a dark side, using his     pan expression and voice as an advantage.  Some say Bogart would've been more suited with the role, but Neff is the kind of character that would look and sound tired all the time, just like MacMurray.  Stanwyck shows delicious darkness in an Oscar-nominated role, there's a scene where her face gradually turns from tearful regret to     y evil that sent chills down my spine.And, of course, there is Edward G. Robinson, in a stellar performance, stealing every scene he is in from under Mac Murray (or whomever's) feet. The role is played with such skill and focus that personally I think it's a travesty he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for it.`Double Indemnity' is the best Film-Noir, a template for perfection, 9/10."
"This film hits the screen like a well trained Olympic runner with comfortable shoes who can feel the gold around his neck before his heels are even in the blocks.  It's what they call `film noir,' because from the opening frames you know that the guy doing the talking is looking at a no-win situation, that he's going to lose and lose big.  Oh, sure, he knows it now; everything you're about to see has already happened, his goose has already been cooked, and now he's going to tell you about it, let you in on what went down, how it went south and why.  He'll even give you the heads up on the irony of the whole thing right out of the chute, how like our Olympic runner he could feel the gold in his hand before the ink on the insurance paper was even dry-- yeah, that's right it was an insurance scam, see, and a good one too-- all the bases were covered and checked for chinks, but in the end-- and here's where the irony comes in-- in the end, he didn't get the money and he didn't even get the girl who put the whole thing in motion.`Double Indemnity,' a classic `noir' thriller in anybody's book, was directed by Billy Wilder, a guy who knows all the ins and outs, ups and downs and double shuffles of the business better than a short jockey on a tall horse.  He's the `go to' guy in a game like this, because he knows all the angles, he knows the lingo and more than that, he has the insights to make it play out like it was the real deal; this guy knows what makes people tick, what motivates them and it's an ace up his sleeve that he plays like a trump card when the chips are down or even if a stack or two looks like they're about to go over.  He knows the whole layout, from top to bottom and side to side because he wrote the script along with another guy you might have heard about, Raymond Chandler, another member of the club who just happens to know his way around the block and back again.  This is a guy who doesn't need a road map to tell him which way to go; he's the guy who `invented' the map.  And when a couple of the boys like Wilder and Chandler get together to make it up and put it down, it's as good as in the can, especially when they're getting the skinny in the first place from James M. Cain, who it just so happens wrote the novel this movie's based on.  Besides which, they got the names Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck down on the dotted lines, the ones that count, the ones that say they're the ones who are the stars of the picture, see?  Let's face it, that's like having Ruth, Mantle and Mays in the outfield at the same time with Sandy Koufax on the mound and Don Drysdale warming up behind him in the bull pen.  The opposition might as well climb back on the bus and take the long ride on the short pier, because Wilder's team already has the big `W' next to their name in the box score.Like I said before, and I'm going to say it again because if there's one thing I've learned during my time on the planet it's that sometimes people just don't listen, or maybe there's some things they just don't want to hear.  But like I was saying, this story's about an insurance scam, a dirty deal that all starts when Mr. Walter Neff (MacMurray), a salesman with a head a couple of sizes too big for his hat, makes a house call and runs into a dame, and not just any dame; her name is Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck), a woman with the kind of beauty that stops traffic, turns heads and makes monkeys out of guys like Neff, guys that think they got it knocked when all the time they're standing in quicksand and don't even know it till they're in up to their ears and gasping for that last breath.  But that's the name of the game; Neff isn't the first guy to find his tiller on the wrong side of the mule because of a pretty face, moist lips and the sweet smell of perfume that sells it all like the siren's song, and he won't be the last to have the deal closed by promises of something that never will be and never has been, though it's victims are heaped along the side of the carefree highway like mounds of bark dust just waiting to be spread or lost in the wind.Maybe that's not a pretty picture, but everything can't be a glossy print on Kodak paper, and you can take that to the bank because history's full of stories like this.  Let's face it, Monet didn't have good eyesight, Van Gogh was down an ear and neither Mona nor her sister Lisa knew how to smile.  And when a pair like Walter and Phyllis get together to cook a stew, there's always a Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) waiting in the wings for them to screw up, take a wrong step or flash a tell that attracts a guy with a nose for fraud like a metal rod drawing lightening.It takes some real `pros' to play the game at this level, and that's Wilder's team all right; but he needed some support to win this big, and he got it from the likes of Porter Hall (Mr. Jackson), Jean Heather (Lola), Tom Powers (Mr. Dietrichson) and Byron Barr (Nino).  This film will give you the kind of ride a Six Flags park could only dream of, and that's what makes `Double Indemnity' one you're going to remember like a first kiss on a warm night in summer.  10/10."
"This wonderful film, with its brooding 1940's atmosphere and superb black-and-white photography (by John Seitz) is one of Hollywood's best. Fred MacMurray's performance, as the insurance man besotted with Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G Robinson's as his boss help make this film memorable. The turns of the plot and the highly-charged suspense ensure that the viewer will not be disappointed. Another of Billy Wilder's hits. Well done!"
"In 1938, the experienced salesman of the Pacific All Risk Insurance Co. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) meets the seductive wife of one of his client, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwick), and they have an affair. Phyllis proposes to kill her husband Dietrichson (Tom Powers) to receive the prize of an accident insurance policy and Walter plots a scheme to receive twice the amount based on a double indemnity clause. When Mr. Dietrichson is found dead on the trails of a train, the police accepts the evidence of accidental death. However, the insurance analyst and Walter's best friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) does not buy the version and suspects that Phyllis has murdered her husband with the help of another man.In my opinion, Billy Wilder was the greatest director of Hollywood ever, directing many masterpieces including ""Double Indemnity"" among them. This is the second time that I see this magnificent film-noir, now on DVD recently released in Brazil (the first time was in the cable television, since this masterpiece has never been released on VHS in my country). The story and screenplay are stunning, disclosing a sordid story of lust, love, greed and betrayal. Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwick and Edward G. Robinson have magnificent performances. The cinematography is simply spectacular, with an awesome use of lights and shadows and the music score completes one of the best movies Hollywood has ever produced. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Pacto de Sangue"" (""Pact of Blood"")"
I consider this to be one of the best movies ever made. The lines in the movie are classic and create an atmosphere that top most other movies. Fred MacMurray and the other actors are brilliant and the chemistry between Fred and Barbara is sparkling. All in all this is a great movie that everyone should see and be amazed by.
"Wilder's astute direction, a cracking tale of murder and deception taken from James M Cain's pulpy novel, an appropriately dark atmosphere, and the lethal combination of Stanwyck/MacMurray and Robinson in support combine for a stunning film noir.MacMurray gives possibly the best performance (definitely the most well-known) of his career as the insurance representative Walter Neff, a weak-chinned chump who lets himself get talked into a murder-for-insurance scheme by the duplicitous double-crossing dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who's not very fond of her older hubby at all.Stanwyck's femme fatale performance is pure dynamite. She's fake and trashy yet alluring with her tart blonde hair (Stanwyck wore a wig), sweetly seductive voice and mesmerizing (to Neff, anyway) anklet. This girl's motives are purely selfish, covered by a pretence of romance, and she is apt to quickly change her line of attack to get what she wants. One moment, Stanwyck is ""crying softly"" on MacMurray's shoulder like a lost little lamb- the next, she is spitting venom like an angry cobra.'Double Indemnity' possesses an amazing script filled with plenty of juicy, hard-bitten dialogue and double entendres. Stanwyck and MacMurray's interactions always have a smoky sexy undercurrent punctuated by cracking one-liners.MacMurray's protagonist provides the voice-over so common to the noir genre. It is one of the best you'll hear, with MacMurray narrating the circumstances of his own downfall with a resigned, yet smooth manner. Great use of lighting and shadows- this film has amazing visual style; it looks foreboding.Robinson is a great in a supporting role as claims manager Keyes, who, after the couple commit their crime (knocking off Barbara's old hubby), quickly gets wise that his death was no accident. It was murder- and Keyes is determined to snuff out the criminal. He suspects Stanwyck from the start, but is oblivious to Neff's involvement. Here, with Robinson and MacMurray's characters, we have possibly the first open declaration of love between two males in the cinema. When Keyes finds out about Neff's involvement, there is no vicious air between the two men. Instead, a kind of hurt, disappointed sadness.One thing I found really nice amidst the dark deeds was Neff's relationship with Dietrichson's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather). As his world is crashing down around him, Walter finds some sort of ironic comfort with the distraught young girl, whose mother and father have both died under suspicious circumstances (Hello, Phyllis) along with her boyfriend being suspected in her father's murder. Ironic indeed, as Walter was one of the perpetrators of her pain. But one feels that their relationship has an underlying purity to it, so we accept it. She is the girl Neff should have taken up with in the first place. After all, Neff is our resident ""poor sucker"". It's that black-hearted witch Phyllis who we have to blame.Or is it? Neff could have backed out of the plan at any time, he was just weak and caught in the clutches of a powerful woman in control. Stanwyck merely activated MacMurray's long-held desire to crook the system. Phyllis does redeem herself to a degree near the film's conclusion, but it's too late for both lovers.The original of a type of crime flick that has been copied relentlessly over the years, 'Double Indemnity' is definitely one of the best, tightest noirs I've had pleasure to view ."
"The long silent street of film noir, a street where it is always night, and where the songs are always sad. That street is usually a dingy urban alley or a dank sidestreet, but in Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, it was a deceptively quiet suburban avenue. ""Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself necessarily mean,"" wrote novelist Raymond Chandler, and as a screenwriter, he joined Wilder in sending one Walter Neff, insurance investigator, down the crookedest of these dead end lanes of the spirit.The streets of Los Angeles are busier and deadlier than they were in Chandler's heyday. Yet Chandler's disquieting, existential take on the City of Angels transcends fashions in both transportation and crime. Those mean streets remain mean, and mementos of Double Indemnity can still be seen all over the city. The Hollywood Bowl where Walter and Lola Dietrichson meet; Walter's apartment at the Château Marmont; the Glendale train station where the ""perfect crime"" begins... And the ""death house"" of Double Indemnity, where Phyllis and Walter meet, plot murder, and where their strange love finally reaches its apocalypse, still stands, secluded and quiet, high in the Hollywood Hills, at 6301 Quebec Street, in Los Angeles. Exteriors were shot there, and sets were modeled after the inside of the house. The house seems to rear up in the summer twilight, remembering the night fifty years ago when a cruel woman brought her husband out to a big LaSalle sedan idling in the garage, with a killer in the back seat. The house's silent, stuccoed cloisters look gloomily down on Quebec Street, while Walter Neff's disembodied footfalls echo off the asphalt."
"Double Indemnity is one of the most famous film noir classics of all time, but I absolutely hate the beginning! Fred MacMurray, bleeding and panting, stumbles into his office and turns on a recorder. He starts his confession, and then the film goes back in time to relive his story as he tells it. I've never liked movies that go back in time because I've never been able to forget the beginning that has pretty much ruined the ending. It was in the back of my mind that Fred MacMurray will do something terrible and get very badly wounded-so the suspense of the flashback was killed for me.While there's nothing wrong with Fred MacMurray's or Edward G. Robinson's performances, Barbara Stanwyck was terribly miscast. I think she's a fantastic actress in many different roles, but an irresistible femme fatale is not one of them. Lana Turner, yes, or Linda Darnell, but Barbara Stanwyck just doesn't pull off sexy in this movie as she did in other films like Clash by Night. Plus, her haircut in this film is bad enough to turn any man away, not attract them! I don't know why those ridiculous bangs were ever popular. However, if you've never seen this classic and you like femme fatales, corny voice-over narration, and stupid men who are easily swayed to the dark side by a pair of legs, you should probably watch Double Indemnity to see where it all began."
"Some cinematic matches seem made in heaven, no matter how discordant they may prove on Earth. Such was unquestionably the case with legendary writer/director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler, when paired up to craft a film adaptation of a dark, seedy novel by James M. Caine, dealing with such rich cinematic potential as deception, double-crossing and murder. While the feuding between Wilder and Chandler was legendary, each despising each other's methods and taking any possible opportunity to ridicule each other, their cinematic concoction, Double Indemnity, was even more legendary. One of the most pitch perfect noir thrillers of all time, each component of the film fits together seamlessly to create a flawless slice of dark movie magic which has lost none of its atmospheric punch and poignancy when viewed in a contemporary setting, over sixty years later. Double Indemnity proves unlike any other films of its time, as the film's tension is extracted not from the question of whether or not the lurid scheme of the central characters will succeed, but instead through the sickly knowledge that they are fated not to, inviting the viewer to watch the whole sordid affair unfold, to see each piece fit disastrously into place. From the opening titles, the film positively drips with fatalism between MacMurray's grim voice-over to the sublime noir lighting, all creating a pitch perfect mood of unease and despair. The masterful technical work is matched by the perfectly honed screenplay by Wilder and Chandler, delivering an engrossing treatise on greed, lust and their abilities to ensnare and corrupt while cleverly mixing cynical introspection with snappy banter and the kind of exquisitely stylized lines filmmakers simply could not pull off now (see the dynamic, thinly veiled ""speeding ticket"" sexual innuendo exchange between Stanwyck and MacMurray). The idea of walking an audience through the planning and execution of a murder was a virtually unprecedented one, but the ingenious daring of Wilder and Chandler does not stop there. Not only does the film empathize with the murderers, Dietrichson for personal gain and Neff as much to shake up the prescribed order of things as his sordid infatuation with her, but also demonstrates how exhilarating and, crucially, entertaining the act of killing could be. Bathing the viewer in a seedy world of secret encounters, lurid sexual acts and casual violence played up as darkly fascinating as opposed to downright immoral, Wilder and Chandler choose to side with characters who ordinarily would have filled the roles of cinematic villains, with the lawful figure Keyes instead played almost as grotesque antagonist, blithely subscribing to a system revolving around asphyxiating order fated to collapse. Though evil is eventually punished, not only is it seemingly predisposed to overcome good, the film seems to silently state, but it is more interesting anyway - a pitch black, endlessly captivating moral stance which has lost not a shred of potency. The casting of lead character Walter Neff carries a similar parallel story of infamy to the film itself; a series of successful stars passing on the role, concerned about the implications of humanising an unrepentant killer. The final casting choice, perennial nice guy Fred MacMurray playing decidedly against type proved simply brilliant, as MacMurray inhabits the role like a cool leather glove, his fast talking salesman veneer carefully concealing a deadness in his eyes, a forever looming darkness barely veiled. MacMurray accomplishes the truly laudable feat of taking a downright unsavoury character yet still retaining the audiences' sympathies despite each unethical act, perfectly essaying the moral crux of the film. Of course, the simply stunning performance by Barbara Stanwyck as one of the most memorable femme fatale figures of the era proves a lurid highlight, as Stanwyck arguably steals the show with her searing, sultry yet devious intensity, far too charismatic and cunning to ever be reduced to a simple object of desire. The two powerhouse leads are well supported by character actor Edward G. Robinson giving a deliciously repellent performance as an order obsessive insurance agent increasingly suspicious of the insurance scam presented to him.Despite the hefty competition, there can be little doubt that Double Indemnity marks its place as one of the most emotionally gruelling and captivating film noirs of its time, and arguably in the history of the industry. Each flawless element of the film melds together to create a truly mesmerizing work just as grimly entertaining as it is technically laudable. For any in search of a taut, hard hitting piece of staunch film-making, few films would prove more fitting than Double Indemnity. -10/10"
"This film was nominated for seven Oscars and probably would have won them all if it had not been going up against Going My Way.Billy Wilder wrote and directed this outstanding film with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson in a role that has to be seen to be believed.Robinson to me is a gangster (Little Caesar, Key Largo, Larceny, Inc), but he is apparently more than that because he was simple incredible as a claims adjuster in this film. The lines Wilder gave him were brilliant and he delivered them without flaw.McMurray was the original Absent Minded Professor and, of course, the father on My Three Sons. he plays the insurance salesman who gets over his head with Stanwyck (The Big Valley). Here she is a hot blond and McMurray falls like a rock.This is one of Wilder's best and one not to miss."
"I have a new favorite movie. If it's not Double Indemnity then at least it's the whole film noir genre. Double Indemnity was THE greatest story I have ever have had the pleasure of seeing. It had it all. It was black and white, it had a great theme song and it had such deep characters. Characters you really feel with. This was my first REAL film noir. I had seen Chinatown before this one but that is classified as neo noir because it's in color.Did I mention that the acting in this movie is the best acting I have ever seen in a movie? And I mean real acting. Not like real acting like you'll find in Mockumentaries where the acting is so natural only because it's improvised. No, the acting in this movie is in the scale of stage actors. The best there is. The lines are all delivered in such a natural way because they are natural. Meaning that there isn't a single line in this movie that I would even think about changing.The directing and cinematography were the best I have ever seen. The opening credits feature a man in crutches walking towards the screen in Silhouette while dramatic music plays over the soundtrack and credits appearing and disappearing on the screen. From there on the movie had me. How could I stop watching after a credit sequence like that? As the movie plays out we keep hearing the same theme. And I wouldn't have it any other way.This movie is recommended. Recommended to everyone by me. If you like any sort of cinema. And if you don't laugh at Adam Sandlers jokes then go and get this movie. Get it and never sell it. Because it is the greatest piece of cinema I have ever seen."
"""The Maltese Falcon"" is generally considered to be the very first film noir, but Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" is the first GREAT noir. With actors that perfectly understood Wilder's penchant for black as tar humour, this film is as seedy, dark and many times funny as they come. Barbara Stanwyck is a knockout as the classic femme fatale, complete with cheap blonde wig and ankle bracelets. Fred MacMurray makes a terrific dope, his silly machimso preventing him from realizing that Stanwyck is one step ahead of him through the entire film. And Edward G. Robinson shines as usual in a small but important role.For me, this film breaks new ground in the hard-boiled/detective/murder mystery genre. I believe it was a bit of a flop when it came out, but that's easy to understand. Films that in retrospect prove themselves to be cutting edge are frequently dismissed at the time of their release. ""Double Indemnity"" doesn't have the look of other studio films of its period, not even other gritty detective films of its period. The lighting is stark and grimy; you can almost see every speck of dust in the shafts of light slanting in through the windows. Wilder gets the feel of a corrupt L.A. just right. But even more than its look, the film is years ahead of its time in its moral tone. Not only do the characters in this film not find redemption, they appear to be unredeemable. Each shows him/herself to be colder and more cynical than the other, and there's a ""Bonnie and Clyde""-like inevitability to their eventual fates.Simply sensational. And watch for the list of ""supposin'""s MacMurray and Stanwyck throw back and forth at each other in one scene. It's hilarious and perfect, and those who've seen the film will know exactly what I'm talking about.Grade: A+"
"Simply the apotheosis of film noir. Twisted plot and irresistibly quotable dialogue, courtesy of Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler. Atmospheric cinematography. Stupendous suspense, even after multiple viewings. La Stanwyck gives a masters class in Diva that Callas could have taken a page from.Fred MacMurray crushes his nice guy image like a sweaty fedora left on the passenger seat on a hot night.Edward G. Robinson is. . .even more so than usual.If you haven't seen Double Indemnity, I envy the film-going experience that lies before you."
"""Double Indemnity"" is a movie I cannot believe I haven't seen earlier: it needs to be counted among the best films ever created, in my humble opinion. The film's single flaw may lie in the way the romance was built up, which may appear to be rather abrupt at certain points of the movie, and I wouldn't even count that as a flaw, because as the story flows along, you will realize that every single moment of the dialogues, the movements, the actions makes total sense. And the film itself? It's absolutely brilliant. Perfection at its greatest level, an execution so sharp and thrilling and compelling that it will knock you off your feet, to speak openly. Barbara Stanwyck gives a flawless performance as the scheming Phyllis Dietrichson, accompanied by Fred MacMurray who may be the weaker actor of the pair, but has enough charisma to pull off working alongside someone like Stanwyck. Edward G. Robinson and Jean Heather do a great job in the supporting cast as well. There is nothing to complain about in this film; if every film-noir movie was like this, I would rush out to watch every single film ever created in this genre. For now and the future, ""Double Indemnity"" remains one of the best film-noirs I have ever seen, probably alongside the likes of ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""The Third Man"" (both of which are movies I can only urge you to check out if you haven't seen them already)."
"There have been, to date, a whopping 350 user reviews of this classic and much imitated ""film noir"" production, so I am tempted to critique at least some of these many attempts at analysis rather than the film itself, but I won't. The achievement of a film to inspire so much of an impassioned response from viewers speaks for itself.If the script is ""silly and laughable"", as one recent reviewer seriously contends, then the laugh is on the reviewer because some of the dialogue was written deliberately to be comical in places, especially when lines begin with the word ""suppose..."" or when they repeat the term ""straight down the line"". To the contrary, I found the script, written by the director himself and Raymond Chandler, to be very snappy, especially when it was so adeptly brought to life by three of the best actors of their time, Stanwyck, Robinson, and MacMurray, in no special order. I especially enjoyed Mr. Robinson's pontificating soliloquies that boasted of his character's extensive knowledge of the risks of the insurance business. Who else but EGR could have succeeded as well in this amusing exercise, and so far beyond the gangster profile that he has established so indelibly in our minds? Beyond his familiar ""well tailored, sophisticated thug"" image, the fact is that Mr. Robinson, who viewed himself more as a stage actor than a film star, excelled in every movie role that he ever tackled, gangster or otherwise. I could list them all here, but I won't.As much as I enjoyed the three wonderful lead actors, I also appreciated all of the meticulous details of the director, Billy Wilder, including minor but memorable characters such as the talkative elevator man (""They wouldn't sell me a policy...""), Netty, the Dietrichsons' disheveled maid (""They keep the liquor closet locked up,"" and who could blame Netty for needing an occasional nip while employed by this miserable pair? ), Mr. Jackson, the witness (""I'm a Medford Man--Medford, Oregon, that is!""), and Nino Zachetti, the angry young man who bitterly resents how he has been cheated by society but walks away without appreciating just how lucky a fellow he actually is. Even the scenes in the food market allowed us an authentic glimpse of everyday life in wartime 1944 Los Angeles, revealing, among other tidbits, that farina packages haven't changed very much in 74 years.The film unfolds as a series of flashbacks with periodic breaks in ""present time"", including the beginning and the end. As Barton Keyes (Robinson) suggests at one point, the film itself is very neatly ""wrapped up in tissue paper...pink ribbons on it."" Unlike many other movies of its ""noir"" genre, it is relatively easy to follow without distracting us with unnecessarily convoluted plots that we don't have to struggle to understand in the first place.Neff's questionable character is revealed from the start as he has no qualms about destroying a marriage and a family until Lola, Dietrichson's daughter, pops up to challenge his conscience. His fatherly relationship with Lola and then his compassionate assistance to Zachetti, her boyfriend, demonstrates that Neff isn't completely morally depraved as much as he is weak in the face of temptation. Regardless of how disagreeable Dietrichson, his victim, is, Neff can't redeem himself from his crime by being nice to Lola and Zachetti. It is not an even exchange. This exercise in portraying a morally flawed but repentant weakling is refined by the actor a decade later in MacMurray's role of Lt. Tom Keefer in ""The Caine Mutiny"". Then, six years later, MacMurray takes immorality to a new level in ""The Apartment""' as the shamelessly dishonest Jeff Sheldrake, who is totally void of introspection. For those who only know MacMurray as the understanding father in the television series ""My Three Sons"", you ain't seen nothin' yet!Although I was fully absorbed in the action, Neff's ability under extraordinary pressure to get Jackson out of the observation car just in the nick of time seemed improbable to me. Didn't he and Phyllis consider the possibility that a possible witness would be there who was unwilling or even incapable of leaving on time? And wouldn't the coroner have established early that Dietrichson was the victim of strangulation rather than an accidental death? I'll leave it to you to decide. And, furthermore, did Phyllis actually undergo a ""change of heart"" just before she was able to fire a second shot? Should it make a difference to us by then? I think not. Nothing could ever redeem this babe--or that wig."
"Along with maybe John Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon', Billy Wilder's 'Double Indemnity' is considered by a majority of critics and audience to be the film that pioneered the rise of the film movement that later came to be termed as Film Noir. 'Double Indemnity' has all the tropes and clichés that became an integral part of the subsequent films of the aforementioned genre. It has the shady and morally crooked characters, the voice-over narration, the seductive and vicious femme fatale, a gloomy look and cinematography which involves a constant attention to the use of shadows and darkness. No one can ever deny how influential a film 'Double Indemnity' is. One has to only see the number of remakes and rip- offs that have been made of it to grasp its legacy.For me, the greatest part of the film are the characters. There are no flawless characters in the film. Everyone is shady. Yes, Phyllis is the femme fatale who initiates the journey towards the dark side. But watching the film, I have always thought that Walter was not completely upright from a moral standpoint when he entered the Dietrichson mansion. Of course his sexual attraction towards Phyllis was the factor that was responsible for his initial interest in her, but I don't think that was the major reason why he decided to devise the plan and commit the murder. I think there was always a hidden urge in him to use his know-how of the insurance business and manipulate the rules and the system to his benefit just like the analogy of the roulette conductor who ends up wanting to rob the house which was mentioned in the narration. He always had this darkness in him, but the chance encounter with Phyllis actually brings that darkness out. Billy Wilder had a dark and cynical side to him, however even in his dark films, he always used to throw in some humanism which is apparent in this film too. We find that although Phyllis is a 'gold digger' and a master manipulator, but Wilder's representation of Phyllis' cranky, husband who doesn't care about his wife's future does provide some justification for her motives. Walter also gets humanised through his great friendship with Keyes. As a matter of fact Wilder himself stated that the relationship between Walter and Keyes was the only love story in the entire film. The way both Walter and Phyllis meet their respective ends in the film also humanises them.The film is directed with meticulous precision. The film uses exaggerated shadows and darkness reminiscent of German expressionist cinema but in a meaningful way in the context of the plot to visually portray the darkness that lurks inside the central characters. The cinematographer uses Venetian blinds expertly to give the illusion of a prison that Wilder wanted. In a way, 'Double Indemnity' uses the plot structure similar to another Wilder film 'Sunset Boulevard' where a man enters a big mansion and meets a woman who ends up making his life a prison. In 'Sunset Boulevard' the mansion itself becomes the prison, while in 'Double Indemnity', the prison is more figurative. Barbara Stanwyck is fantastic as Phyllis. She expresses a lot through her eyes and effortlessly shifts from innocent to seductive throughout the film. It is very difficult to play a character who remains a mystery for the viewer as well as the other characters in the film and she does it very well. Fred MacMurray expertly plays a man who thinks he has everything figured out while the viewer knows that this is just his overconfidence. It is fascinating to see his facial expressions change from one of confidence to one of extreme paranoia over the course of the plot. Edward G. Robinson puts in a dynamic performance as Keyes. His character is cynical and unsentimental, but his scenes with MacMurray are probably the most humane in the whole film and these scenes exude a sense of mutual respect which lacks in the scenes with Phyllis and Walter.The screenplay written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. What makes the film a little less effective in my eyes now after all these years is the lack of a gradual rise in the sexual tension between the two characters. I think this was well executed in Kasdan's 'Body Heat' which was a remake. I thought the relationship felt slightly rushed, but of course the strict censorship of the 1940s also plays a role in this. Another aspect is that the plot of the film has been reused on so many occasions that it no longer has the same impact that it once had. This is not a blot on the film, but that's the honest thought that I had watching it in 2016.'Double Indemnity' certainly deserves its recognition and acclaim as the film that led to the rise of Film Noir. It is well acted and brilliantly directed. But unfortunately due to the umpteen number of remakes and similar films that have appeared subsequently, the impact of the basic plot of the film might feel a bit diluted at this day and age."
"Words will not define the things that I achieved by viewing this film. The fascinating part that comes into my mind before going further is the extraordinary narrative that binds you physically as well as mentally. The film follows the journey of a sales person of an insurance company who gets into a number of events which made the whole film. It is a mix of attraction, cheating and surprises.PROS:Without a fascinating story, the film would not have been this better, so most of the credit I would give to it. Then I liked the narration which was because of the actor's firm voice. The acting is superb by all the actors. The story starts with a very fast pace from the starting itself and maintained this till the end which was beautiful. The different instances in the film are shown so properly that you would not feel that it is from the forties.CONS:Found the film absolutely perfect.MESSAGE: ""You can't escape longer.""VERDICT: ""A must watch for anyone."""
"Double Indemnity's storyline has probably been played over thousands of times since insurance claimants have existed. Rotten relationship, money at the end of the tunnel and scrupules vanish like snow in the spring...this movie covers its bases admirably, however.Barbara Stanwyck captivates at the black widow drawing Neff into her web. Could he interest her in some Accident Insurance? What if they split the claim? Hubby is so heartless and cold...could he help at all? It's easy for us in front of the big HDTV screen to mock Walter but the truth of the matter is, emotion and passion rule the day at times.Fred MacMurray is spot on as the hapless insurance salesman caught between his otherworldly clairvoyant boss Barton Keyes, the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson and his own principles. Phyllis' husband is murdered in a plan so intricate that it should, nay will, fool the claims investigators. That is, until the big boss considers it fishy and Barton gnaws at the case's inconsistencies like a rat on a piece of rotten flesh. Eventually Neff confronts Phyllis, who has had enough and tries to dispose of him (as she has her husband's ex-wife, told through her daughter) and her statement that she is utterly empty inside before succumbing to gunshot wounds in a close quarters fight with Neff is chilling, to say the least.Simply can't say enough about this one folks. If you want to catch a taut murder-mystery, put Double Indemnity at the top of your list!"
"Greetings again from the darkness. ""I wonder if you wonder."" Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups. This reinforces my belief that we should never miss an opportunity to view good films in a theatre setting ... just as the director intended.Since this film was released 67 years ago, it's difficult to discuss without noting a key plot point or character reaction. If you haven't seen it and plan to, you might stop reading here. If you would like a little insight, then let's keep going. Billy Wilder (left) directed the film and his place as a Hollywood legend is quite secure. He was nominated for 21 Oscars (Director, Writer, Producer) and had 3 wins. Some of his classics are: The Lost Weekend, Sunset Blvd, Witness for the Prosecution, Some Like it Hot, The Apartment, The Front Page. Many think of Wilder as a comedic filmmaker and he certainly had success in that genre, but if you watch closely, even his comedies have a dark element to them.Double Indemnity is based on the novella by James M Cain, who also wrote Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wilder was a fan of Cain's book, but knew the dialogue wouldn't work well on screen. So together with Raymond Chandler they wrote a screenplay filled with crackling lines and a constant feeling of dread and pending doom. As great as the script is, it is heightened by a wonderful cast that includes Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G Robinson, Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines and Byron Barr.For me, MacMurray's performance is what brings the words to life and jumps the film to the ""must see"" category. He is playing against two Hollywood heavyweights in Stanwyck and Robinson, but we are somehow sympathetic to this not-so-bright guy who gets played like a fiddle by the villainous, wily woman he lusts after. Even as he is recording his confession, a part of us understands how he got drawn into MURDER! Not just any murder, but one for money and love ... only there is no money, and there is no love.Ms. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as the femme fatale who weaves her web of deceit and destruction. She quickly spots the vulnerability of MacMurray's character and uses her assets just enough to hold the leash tight. It is a testament to her screen presence that she can pull off the sultry siren while sporting a less-than-desirable blonde wig. At the time, the wig was so controversial that the producers compared it to George Washington and wanted it trashed. However, filming was too far along and now it's impossible to imagine her looking any other way. Besides, MacMurray only seems to notice her anklet!Edward G Robinson made a name for himself as a tough-guy actor ... cop and mobster all rolled into one. Here he plays the insurance investigator with a sixth-sense for fraudulent claims. He is a hard-nosed, dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously and has no sympathy for those who cheat his cherished system. He has a soft spot for co-worker MacMurray, even though he is one of the back-slapping salesmen he so loathes. Their relationship in the film is one of respect and about as close as two professional men could be, given the era. When Robinson goes off on his rant about suicide research, he is a joy to behold. This guy could flat chew scenery.In addition to the infamous wig, you might also notice that MacMurray is wearing a wedding band throughout the film, even though his character is clearly a single man. Wilder and MacMurray stated many times over the years that was simply a mistake and not ""caught"" until post-production. Expect a chuckle when MacMurray, as the narrator, enviously describes a Spanish style Los Angeles home as costing $30,000 ... probably less than the property taxes would be on that house today. The film originally was to end with MacMurray in the Gas Chamber and Robinson looking on (inset), but this was deemed inappropriate. One last little nugget: early in the film, MacMurray walks out of Robinson's office and past a man sitting on a hallway chair reading a paperback book. That man? Raymond Chandler, in his only on screen appearance.The film is often described as quintessential Film Noir. Another prime example of Film Noir would be The Big Sleep (1946), based on a Raymond Chandler novel, directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While Film Noir might not be an easily definable term, there are certain elements that must be present. Lighting is key. Shadows must be prevalent. Some type of detective story is usually at the center, and we typically get some poor schlub of a guy being yanked around by the femme fatale. The right ""mood"" is essential ... as a viewer we know things are headed down the wrong path, but we just can't save the characters from their own poor choices. But neither can we look away. That helpless feeling is a strong indicator that you just watched a terrific Film Noir."
"Double Indemnity (1944)Double Crossing True LoveThe are a million reasons to love this movie and a million people who have already said what they are: tight filming, great plot, fabulous acting, and the beginning of a new, truly American genre of movies: the film noir.This isn't the first crime film with noir qualities, but it has two key ingredients: a man with a morally sound core led astray, and a woman (the femme-fatale) leading him astray. I suppose you could interpret this in sexist ways, or as an extension of Adam and Eve dynamics into our century. Not that Adam killed Eve in the end, as far as we know.As an example of classic, early noir this is notable for coming before the war had ended, and it lacks the most common thread of the man coming from some unknown past (life as a G.I. or just life somewhere unspecified), but in a way Fred MacMurray's main character, who leads the whole film, is comparably adrift. Maybe he represents that man left home during wartime, feeling out of place for the simple reason of not being over there, somewhere. And maybe living in a separate morality.MacMurray is cast perfectly, even if he was a second choice by director Billy Wilder. His bumbling intelligence, his compromised morality, his giving in so easily (if easily is the word after the murder) all make sense, and they might not with a Mitchum type of stronger character. Even his inner morality, and his ability to say ""I love you"" at the end, to the character who he clear does love, are convincing. And a movie with this many fast twists has to be convincing as much as it is dramatic. Barbara Stanwyck? Cold and deceptive at her best, making Mrs. Dietrichson truly horrid. But highest kudos goes to the insurance investigator, the third main character, Edward G. Robinson. The screen bristles and bursts whenever he comes on, and he seems overdoing it and yet not a bit overacting. It's just a scintillating performance. John F. Seitz is brilliant behind the camera (proven here, absolutely, but also in Sunset Blvd and many other films, see the listings for the late 1940s for the classics). Music, editing, and most of all, smart, snappy direction make the film tight and truly great. The only small thing that might hold it back from that top edge of the most moving films is some weird sense of skimming the surface of all these emotions and conflicts. They are issues of plot more than character. Yes, we hear Neff with the voice-over recasting the events from his plaintive and regretful tone, and that works brilliantly. But Stanwyck, especially, comes across as simply cold. We never quite feel why she's the way she is, we just accept it. The daughter strangely makes more sense than the mother, though her role, and her impact on the film, are both small. Finally, relating all of this together, I don't ever buy into their passionate love--of course hers is fake all along, but Neff is supposed to throw everything away for the Mrs. Dietrichson, and we swallow that, too, without tasting why.But quibbles, quibbles. One measure, for me, of a great movie is if I can watch it again even when I know the plot. And this one I can, I did, and you should."
"""I couldn't hear my own footsteps... it was the walk of a dead man."" This flick is the ultimate black comedy in my opinion. And not only in tone and story line... but it is dark night pretty much all the time and even when it isn't, there are shadows all over everything. It looks cool. It feels uneasy. Sometimes I want to laugh but I feel somehow immoral when I do. The suspense is incredible, if you can go there with it. Go there. Walter Neff narrates the tale of his own demise. What a dope, a funny, smart, and likable guy, but a dope just the same. Keys is great with all his ranting around and his little man. And Phyllis is the most conniving femme fatale I've seen. She looks and feels like sleaze. I'm afraid of her. I love to be afraid."
