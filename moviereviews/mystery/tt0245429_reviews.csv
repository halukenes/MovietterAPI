"Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"'Spirited Away' is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki. What do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes. Through Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. There's a certain sense of revile about the youth of Japan at the moment. Many people consider them to be ill-mannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers. They are simply bi-products of their material world and consumerism. 'Spirited Away' taps into this. At the start Chihiro is a selfish, spoiled, whiny brat. But as she plunges deeper into the spirit world, she becomes more independent, more assured, more respectful and learns some manners. No Face, a black figure with a white mask, is the catalyst behind Chihiro's transformation. Once he is let into the bathhouse, we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth. Watching No Face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight. The three main characters in Miyazaki's youth allegory are Chihiro, No Face and Bô. All of these characters are disconnected with their world. They are lonely, misunderstood and largely ignored. But when they go on their journey together, they united and become stronger individuals.Miyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes  which makes 'Spirited Away' a universal story that most of us can connect with. I'm willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren't advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.The animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney's works  but there's something superior to that. 'Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku's dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It's also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger. The sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don't speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers', is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality. 'Spirited Away' is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium. It works on a multitude of levels; a social commentary on Japan, a homage to ancient Japanese/Russian mythology, a moral film for both children and adults. But most importantly, it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game. 'Spirited Away' works much like a relaxing journey. Pop in the DVD; leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip again."
"There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering unto the public works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.Much like Miyazaki's previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fairytale fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.The world of Spirited Away is simply bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki's character designs, much like in Mononoke, is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, even fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline, to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams.Prepare to be Spirited Away........................"
"Spirited Away is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen. The least I can say about it is that there was not a single moment during it that my attention wasn't completely focused. The plot was fantastic and full-bodied. Each character was given so much personality, even the little soot spiders weren't treated as two-dimensional.In a way the whole film felt like a dream, in that it is seamless. It flows, effortlessly, from scene to scene, from emotion to emotion - straight from terror and tragedy to comedy - without the subtle bump that wakes you up, that lets you know that the makers of the movie and the creator of the script had wanted you to be crying but now you really should be laughing. It was so LIFELIKE. Sometimes in real life the most grim moments contain honest elements of comedy that do not seem out-of-place. But trying to put that sort of convoluted emotion into a film creates a very thin line that too many have fallen off of.There was no part of the film that felt fake, or rushed, or shaky; the intensity of the story line and the determination of the lead character was obvious throughout. More than causing interest, this movie made me FEEL. I was sucked into the drama. I can rarely say that a movie made me laugh and cry without feeling like an idiot, but the caliber of this picture is so high that I don't even feel embarrassed. I laughed. I cried. And you will too."
"Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak. BUT... I recently re-watched it on DVD with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable. The film came alive like the other Miyazaki's I've seen. It seemed infinitely more layered, detailed, intelligent and witty than I remembered. Could it be that retaining the intended performances (even if the words are unintelligible) can make that much difference? Maybe the dub was just poorly done? Or was it just because I was now versed in the language of Ghibli? As a little experiment I decided to re-watch some of the film with both the English subtitles and English language dub in order to compare, I ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination. It's simply amazing what a difference there is. Entire scenes change. It's not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner - in the dub, the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed, and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum. Relationships between characters are changed, their motivations and personalities are changed, the difference is shocking. I appreciate western, and particularly American audiences can be put off by subtitles. And cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway. It's pointless to be all righteous when, fundamentally, you just want people to see the film. Unless they do, this treasure trove will remain undiscovered, and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the 'subtitle demon' (as Miyazaki might call him). But the problem is the quality of these dubs, and the liberties taken with the source material. Of course, without speaking Japanese, who can say it's not the subtitles that are way off? They're probably written by westerners too. But the dub just stinks of Disneyfication. Saturday morning generic nonsense. The challenging, uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered down.A fair question might be, 'if it's so bad why was it so successful?' The success is evidence of the films staggering quality. Even so, it hardly challenged whatever Jerry Bruckheimer movie was showing at the time. In Japan it's the biggest grossing film in history. 'Go figure,' as Chihiro wouldn't say."
"Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.e.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don't mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.Apart from that, did you ever notice that some ""camera language"" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the ""camera"" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji's introduction about Haku's background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.There're many other things like this, shouldn't be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that's not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.I am a visual effects person and film maker but I can't tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character's movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don't have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio's work. ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.""Ice Age"" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with ""Spirited Away"" I'm afraid. And I'd laugh at the opinion that the story of ""Ice Age"" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn't recognise it, actually I believe ""Spirited Away"" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while ""Ice Age"" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I'm afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one."
"This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen and I will certainly watch his others. The story plays on many elements successful with kids films, that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too. The story centres around Chihiro, a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in. These fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car. At the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open, with glorious displays of mouth watering food. There are no people about but Chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later. As Chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark. It is too late however, because as night falls, ghosts are awakened, and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs. She then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place, her only allie being the boy she met earlier. She is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park, a bath house run by Yubaba, an evil power mad witch. This is a bath house for the spirits and Chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself, then unable to save her parents.The story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange. This is just so much more creative than Hollywood. The characters are likeable and we become engrossed with Chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse, and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world. What I also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography, the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that American animations rarely do. Another film I think of that looked really good was Bellville Rendezvous. Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making. *****"
"I really enjoyed this film-everything about it glows and shines in a gentle luminosity. This film, if you have seen some of Miyazaki's other work, is quite light. The characters are beautifully and lovingly created and the colouring and setting of this film is absolutely superb. This is a beautiful little film and I can't wait for the next feature from Hayao Miyazaki-he is better than Walt Disney.Miyazaki blends the characters and the environment very well together, and I can see that this would be enjoyed for people at many different levels. Miyazaki enjoys creating female heroines and I was pleased that Chihiro lived up to the expression and beauty of her predecessors-like Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind. This is beautiful and I would advise anyone to take a look at it's scope and serenity, along with it's fast paced plot and of course, the dreamlike settings that make it truly wonderful."
"Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don't know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to ""suit American audiences"". Personally I think that's a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the 'same film' the rest of the world sees.OK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I'm glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).The film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange ""theme park"" on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very ""wrong"" (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.This is an 'adult-oriented' movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It's a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a ""kiddee film"") but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit ""weirded out"" by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the ""kidney-buster"" sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like ""cartoon movies"", you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves."
"Mystical. Enchanting. A key to another world. There are so many ways to describe this movie. The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of ""spirit world"". When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they're cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at ""The Bath House"". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called ""Sen"". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I've watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it. It has been another inspiring movie from Haiyo Miazaki that is above all his best yet. A 10 out of 10 for this wonderful movie."
One of the best movies I've ever watched and is still stuck with me til this day.
"The art work alone is worthy of the engulfment one experiences when watching the big screen, making me wish I had seen it on the big screen.  That is, unless the major release in the US was the English language version. 
We ended up renting the DVD and watching it in English.  The sound, the voice of Chihiro in particular, grated our ears like nails on a chalk board. After watching it, we played around with the DVD and found the original Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles. Far more subtle and simply put, an AMAZING difference.So, I would suggest watching it in both languages.  English so that you can concentrate on the scenery (with the sound turned down low.  Really, the screeching and shouting in English is annoying). Then watch it in Japanese for the color and mood the dialog provides."
"This movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. I hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. Being a huge Oscar fan, I was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. At that point, knew nothing about it.After reading a little more and seeing some commercials, I still wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see this film. It looked so surreal in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" sort of way. I had never been a big fan of that film and didn't really want to relive such an idea. Mindbending films have never been my absolute favorites.I went to see ""Spirited Away"" with a friend who was into anime. He hadn't heard much about it either, but was interested in seeing it in the theater. Since it had won the Academy Award, I decided it was a good idea to give it a shot.I am so glad I did. Only a very few times in my life have a I seen a movie as brilliant as this. It stands alone with such masterpieces like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""The Godfather"" and any other classic piece of cinema in history.I won't go into too much detail, but I was spellbound from the opening credits until the closing ones. The story starts out so rough and scary, but becomes a work of happiness and beauty. To think that this movie almost didn't get made is a travesty. It will stand the test of time and go out as one of the greatest films ever made."
"I rented this film from Blockbuster after hearing about it from a friend. I was slightly reluctant, never seeing an anime film before, but I watched it six times before giving it back two days later, then bought it the next day. My daughter watched it with me every time and loved it as much as I did. It was an astonishing film, though scary at times, but wonderful the whole way through. It had some laugh out loud funny moments and the next minute you were on the edge of your seat and it all seemed so real. It really got me into anime. Since then I have also watched Howl's moving castle, which is fabulous. My daughter went one step further and learnt to draw manga. I must say she is quite good! She also is learning to play the opening theme on the piano. It's 4 pages long. Rather her than me! I would recommend this film to anybody. But be warned. It's very... different."
"In Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated feature, `Spirited Away,' a young girl by the name of Chihiro and her parents stumble across an abandoned `amusement park' that turns out to be a mysterious bathhouse for the spirit world (a la `Carnival of Souls').  After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that `Spirited Away' might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.   The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do. For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?    The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that `Spirited Away' has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well. 
`Spirited Away' offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care."
"Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature, large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house, stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and human-frog hybrids.The animation is stunning. Miyazaki truly sees animation as an artform. Many stand out scenes contain no dialogue at all, and are merely animated images creating surreal effects: Chihiro in the lift with the Radish spirit, Chihiro running through the flowers, and the final train ride, where our young protagonist takes a mysterious train journey across a sea, with her spirit friend, No Face. Nothing much happens, it's just simple, colourful, oddly unsettling, and lingers long after the film ends.The characters are also perfect, and add to strange storyline. There's Kamaji, the multi limbed boiler room operator, Yubaba, the evil witch, and her massive baby child. No Face is a peculiar spirit who turns feral when Chihiro is not around, and finally, Haku, a boy spirit, who shares an emotional scene with Chihiro towards the end of the film.Colourful, imaginative, interesting, and emotional. Spirited Away is a film you'll want to see time and time again. Buy it."
"The art of Spirited Away, and other Miyazaki films are masterpieces.A visual masterpiece, and a spectacularly beautiful animated film."
"That ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece would seem to any sane person to be beyond dispute. This is the first of Miyazaki's films I've seen and had it recommended to me by a friend who's into anime. I'm really not keen on Manga at all, so I delayed seeing ""Spirited Away"" for a few months. I finally got around to seeing the subtitled version - never, never waste your time with dubbed versions of foreign movies - over the weekend and I loved every frame of it. The imagination and creativity blew me away and I'd put the film alongside other ""children's"" masterpieces like ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"", Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy and Ray Bradbury's poetic ""Something Wicked this Way Comes""..However, in reading through the other comments for ""Spirited Away"" here I was struck by the huge chasm between the views of those who love the film and (the appropriately small minority of) those who don't.Even more striking is the strident hostility of those who don't like the film towards those who do. Critics here have called fans of the movie, ""liars to yourselves"", ""gushing"", ""flat-out wrong"" and the movie itself, ""inane"", ""unwatchable bilge"", ""muddled"", ""nonsensical"", ""gibberish"".Now I'd be scratching my head in puzzlement even if these commentators had blandly stated that this film wasn't for them, but this outpouring of venom had me completely perplexed.Another viewer states, ""The girl basically had to suffer for something even her parents didn't do wrong, they just wanted to explore things."" And here lies a glimpse of some possible explanations of why some folks don't get this movie. The whole point is the parents *did* do something wrong. They greedily ate food that wasn't theirs. Apart from being just plain rude, it's stealing. As another commentator here pointed out, you have to look at ""Spirited Away"" against the context of the culture that produced it. The Japanese are very concerned about the erosion of their traditional values, the lack of respect kids have for their elders, the breakdown of family cohesion and other ""negative"" ""Western"" influences on their traditional, polite, family-oriented culture. Perhaps we in the West have trouble with the concepts in ""Spirited Away"" because the influences that the Japanese audiences fear are the Western ""values"" that are being thrust upon them, values that we've grown up with and forgotten how to fear.Another critic commented ""I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people ... (though) my brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall. That was pretty funny, I must say."" This made me think back to when The Simpsons first started on TV - my daughter was three years old and she thought the funniest joke ever was when Maggie fell over. Now my daughter's a (very bright) 14 year old and these days it's the razor sharp satire of dysfunctional family life that makes her laugh out loud. QED. If someone isn't sensitive to the morals that are being examined in this film, then of course the film is going to seem pointless. However, as the film plainly does have more than one good point to make, perhaps it's just that these critics aren't capable of grasping any of them.But really guys (and you know who you are) don't take your frustration at not understanding ""Spirited Away"" out on those of us who do. It's not our fault you don't get it."
"As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!However there is no point of handing out the superlatives to a movie, without explaining what the movie is all about. In a nutshell, the movie is about a ten year old girl who is travels to a strange yet enchanting world, after her parents were morphed into pigs. This change of shape was produced by the evil witch, Yubaba, an nasty sorceress who rules over this paralell universe. To avoid detection, the ten year old girl, Chihiro has to work for Yubaba in her bath house. This is where she meets all kind of strange and wonderful characters, like the half man half spider Kamaiji, the mysterious little boy, Haku and many other characters. Though Chihiro had met all these people, her only wish is to go home and turn her parents back to their normal human selves. Watching this movie, has made me wonder why is this feature shown in very small arthouse cinemas and it is on pirate DVDs, when it should be easily shown on the multiplex cinemas. This is a truly amazing movie, whereby the whole story, transports oneself to their earlier childhood. I know that happened to me. Also the movie's animation was totally amazing, in ways that Pixar and Dreamworks would just die for. A good example of this is the flower scene. In conclusion, everyone should watch this movie, whether young or old, japanese or any other nationality, because at the end of the day, this will show you emotions that any other animations will not give you the chance to show."
"I have given movies 10 out 10 stars before, but this just crosses a completely new line into something even above 100% greatness; perfection. This may be the only film I have ever seen that is completely perfect, I would change absolutely nothing about it. The only other film that I would put over the top is, coincedentally, My Neighbor Totoro. The fact that the are made by the same company has nothing to do with it.Whenever I watch this movie, not only do I find things that I didn't notice the time before, but I feel a sense of having already seen certain things in it before, somewhere else. But I haven't - it is just the originality, and the new ideas that other movies will build on from this one. Everything is perfect. The illustrations are detailed, flowing, and mesmerizing. The musical score is dead-on, and sneaks along in the background for most of the running. And the story takes on a form that I am attempting to do in my first work - complete layers. Two people could watch this, and come away with different ideas and plot lines. This is exactly what a movie should do, keep everyone that sees it thinking about it afterwards. There is no definite ending or beginning, it is left purely to the imagination.The entire film seems like just a slice of someone's imagination, and when I watch it, I consider it mine."
"This is not a bad movie at all, but its really not that great either. I don't really understand what all the endless praise is over. The animation is amazing for sure but the story feels really convoluted. I don't really understand what the ghost character with the gold was. I didn't understand what he was or what we wanted exactly. Maybe i'm missing something. Also their is a character that apparently is a human but also a dragon and then later turns out to be a river spirit? The f*#k?!?! There is no real deep meaning in the movie as far as I can tell. The main character is fairly static throughout the whole movie and doesn't really grow or learn anything (she is also quite annoying at times) Also I'm not totally sure what the target audience is supposed to be here. At times it feels like a family movie sometimes it feels like a creepy horror movie with scary looking characters. I don't really know who this movie is for. As I said not a bad movie, but the story feels all over the place and feels pretty pointless when all is said and done."
"The word masterpiece is being thrown around a little bit too much on this one.While I found myself stunned by the visuals in Spirited Away (particularly a magnificently realized train ride across the sea), its lackluster story - little more than a rip-off of (or homage to) Alice In Wonderland - keeps this film from being a classic masterpiece.Some of the ideas were extraordinarily imaginative (the spirit bathhouse, Haku's transformation into a dragon, Yubaba's transformation into a bird, the boiler-room operator), others were just downright ridiculous (No-Face's regurgitation, the bouncing disembodied heads, the baby, an evil twin sister - what is this Days Of Our Lives?).This is not to say that I was expecting literal-minded filmmaking.  I was thoroughly impressed by the director's previous film, Princess Mononoke, but I felt its story was integral to its success (i.e. a hero's journey; the forces of human industrialization vs. nature and the need to co-exist peacefully).  The ""story"" in Spirited Away is much more simplistic (girl overcomes her fears) and, as a result, leaves little in the way of narrative thrust or suspense (especially for a 2 hour movie).  Princess Mononoke's story was epic and its running time and pace justified.  Spirited Away is merely serviceable in every way except its visual palette."
"It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.Hayao Miyazaki, who has directed many of the most acclaimed animated movies in animation history (under the banner of Studio Ghibli), has stated that Spirited Away is 'for the people who used to be ten years old and the people who are going to be ten years old'. Perhaps, he really knows how children see things in their own eyes, as he might use to face during his childhood times (that's why most of his movies feature flying ships/creatures, tons of imaginative elements derived from Asian/Western cultures, some preferences from classic fairy tales, etc.) Most importantly, Mr. Miyazaki uses this tagline as an essential plot device to show the innocence, the bizarre, the horror and the wondrous revelation that the main protagonist (Chihiro) sees, feels and experiences throughout her spiritual journey, a path that we all had crossed as children before the madness of the world overwhelms our innocence. Fortunately, movies like Spirited Away succeeds in regaining our former consciousness, pulling us into his imaginative world where our childhood memories have never died; they are merely hidden inside our hearts and Mr. Miyazaki is enable to reshape them with everything this movie has to offer.Instead of the cliché-ridden plots that mar state-of-the-art-animated films of today, Mr. Miyazaki refers to his personal experience in Japan as another plot device while maintaining the classic storytelling technique to create an entirely refreshing concept based on real-life situations. If you think Spirited Away features some of the most incomprehensibly bizarre characters you've never seen, fear not! Like all good movies, despite their oddity, they all are no different from us in terms of how they adapt to life and their functions to keep the company going. That also leads to the fact that Spirited Away is really not a good vs. evil show (like Star Wars); despite its scary images, powerful spells and evil-looking monsters, they are all surprisingly ordinary with mere characteristics of maids, bosses and customers. So don't expect a Darth Vader-like antagonist to cover the whole world with darkness while unleashing a large army of robotic troopers to destroy everything in their sights.The overall animation is simply breathtaking. Even as they are all hand-drawn, the characters' expressions and body postures are all wonderfully done in a very natural way, the same applies to these beautiful background settings painted painstakingly by some of Ghibli's most talented artists in Japan. Speaking of animation, when watching it up close and personal, it does bear some resemblance to Disney's Snow White as well as his classic movies (unlike the new, recycled Disney movies of the early 2000s) in terms of its cel-shaded look and the way most characters move and interact (strangely, though, Mr. Miyazaki is not a big fan of Disney. Ironically, Disney is the only company that understands his movies' significance to moviegoers around the world, so it serves as a distributor to Ghibli's animated movies in North America.). Unlike most current anime that requires CGI to excite the audience, Mr. Miyazaki fortunately decides not to rely much on fancy digital applications (there are some subtle CGI effects, which are cleverly implemented on certain parts of the movie).Disney, in its other matter, has done a good job in translating the movie's original Japanese context to its English counterpart without radically changing the flow and theme of its entire story, thanks to Pixar animator and executive producer John Lasseter (however, Disney's marketing power fails to attract more moviegoers). Despite the audience's varied reactions on English and Japanese tracks, in my opinion, I find both of them outstanding and seem to have a natural pattern to influence the mood of the movie. Once again, Joe Hisashi, the composer of many of Miyazaki's movies, has provided some of the finest and most memorable cues ever to bring grace to the screens (one of my personal favorite is a cue in which Haku finally remembers his original name, shedding its scales in the sky). Without these important audio elements, Spirited Away could have been another uninspiring, lifeless show.It is no doubt that Spirited Away has indeed changed the way we look at animated movies, similar to the way the original Star Wars trilogy, the first two Godfather movies and films by Steven Spielberg did. It is also true that whatever I write in this review, a single picture tells a thousand words; you still need to watch it with your own eyes, feel it as you are still a child and you will understand a thousand reasons why this movie should receive an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. However, like many artistic filmmakers, Mr. Miyazaki is not interested in such glamorous spotlights and moneymaking propaganda, as he continues to inspire newer generations with his latest waves of masterpieces, starting with Howl's Moving Castle.Thank you, Mr. Miyazaki for proving once again that childhood memories will forever endure within our hearts and souls until the end of time."
"Upon hearing that this became Japan's highest grossing film ever, I went out of my way to look for a theater that had this movie here in the states. I traveled some, paid top dollar for the ticket, and, after seeing it, was totally blown away by the experience I had. I had no doubt in my mind that I have seen the best movie of the year, and quite possibly the best animated movie I have EVER seen.The story starts with a young girl named Chihiro, and her family, moving to a new place. When they wander into what seems like an abandoned theme park and her parents start to eat prepared food (but with no one around to attend them), they turn into pigs. Chihiro runs and encounters a bathhouse for the gods and spirits. With the help of a young boy named Haku, Chihiro learns that in order to reverse the effects of her parents dilemma, she must work in the bathhouse. Life isn't easy, not even for the gods. She'll come across bizarre creatures & places. She will learn hard work, the sense of loss, greed, & the importance of friendship and love.It's dreamy-like quality, it gorgeous scenes, and it's incredible list of characters (frogs that talk, a dragon, a baby that is 12 feet tall, a multi-armed boiler-room man) will keep you glued to the story. Children will love this film, yet it is sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy and relish in it's beauty. It does have it's scary bits and images, however, so very young children may be frightened. But this is still the type of movie that you go out and buy, even if you don't have children. So imaginative is the world that Chihiro falls in, thoughts of 'Alice in Wonderland' & 'The Wizard of Oz' may come to mind. But 'Spirited Away' ends up with it's own originality. It's a timeless piece, and will eventually be a classic that will no doubt be shown to generations.In the DVD, Disney made sure that the voice acting for the English version is top-notch, but, even if you don't liked dubbing, you have the option to switch to Japanese with subtitles.How could 'Spirited Away' become the first anime film to be nominated for, AND WIN an Academy Award? How did it gross $200 million before it even came to the states? The answer lies in mastermind creator Hayao Miyazaki. So well known in Japan, he is now getting the recognition he deserves internationally. With past hits like Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and his studio, Ghibli, have created outstanding features that very few animation studios can even match. Their movies are hand-drawn, without all the CGI that many studios are using. Amid the fact that Disney has distributed these treasures, I would say that there isn't much in the Disney vaults that can even come close to matching what Miyazaki and his studio have produced.Do not hesitate to watch this magical, enchanting, and rare gem that we have the privilege to see. And if you have seen it, go out of your way to view the rest of Miyazaki's films, like 'Nausicaa', 'Castle in the Sky', & 'Kiki's Delivery Service'.Undeniably a perfect 10 out of 10"
"The beautiful looking work of Spirited Away will catch you breathless from the get go, but sadly the story will neither entice nor enthrall you enough to stay focused on what's happening. The films story feels rather surreal and incoherent, giving no indication to what and why characters do certain actions. It also fails at being anything near original, muddling up previously used stories and creating one big jumbled mess.Whilst the story of Spirited Away may be hard for some to understand, one cannot leave the film without praising the artwork. It almost makes up for a lack of a coherent storyline, but for the most part the story does leave you wanting to know more; but to know more about what's happening, not about what's going to happen."
"Seldom have I seen a movie full of such boundless fantasy, incredible beauty and opulent pictures. Miyazaki presents the story of Chihiro who has to rescue her parents from the spell of a witch in fantasy world with such extravagant richness that stuns the spectator.Granted the story about this fantasy world with all kinds of exceptionally weird creatures and situations takes needs getting used to at first. But very soon the spectator is totally engrossed by the magical story and overwhelming pictures.In view of the diversity of bizarre creatures, the filmmaker's creativity seems almost unlimited. The beautiful pictures have a very soothing and at the same time enthusiastic effect onto the spectator.But the brilliance of the movie doesn't only result from the beauty of the pictures, the story itself is very subtle and profound. In short, it is a story about growing-up. Chihiro and her parents are on their way to their new home in the suburbs when they accidentally step into a magical world, where Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs. From now on, Chihiro has to manage everything by herself. She has to attempt to turn her parents back into humans and is confronted with situations and characters that don't coincidentally seem like metaphors of our world. Now, Chihiro learns how to solve problems herself and how to deal with the characters of the people she meets. At the end, Chihiro has turned into a almost mature person. Although occidental spectator won't be able to understand all symbolisms that are conveyed by the characters, but there's is actually no need of it. The fantastic world and its creatures perfectly work as a scenery for a wonderful coming-of-age story. The wonderful, as customary for composer Joe Hisaishi, music adds even more magical beauty to the scenery."
"My previous experience with Studio Ghibli began and ended with 'My Neighbour Totoro' but upon seeing the fantastic 'Spirited Away', I feel as if a whole new world of anime and Hayao Miyazaki has just opened up to me. Until now, apart from the odd Disney flick and, of course, 'My Neighbour Totoro', I had long consigned animation to childhood but this film is a perfect example of how how rich and diverse even an animated film can be.'Spirited Away' centres on ten-year-old Chihiro, a little Japanese girl who accidentally stumbles upon the Spirit World while exploring a mysterious passageway with her parents. When her parents are turned into pigs for stealing food, it falls to young Chirhiro and Haku, her guide in this strange new world, to save them before they become bacon. Not only are the characters well-depicted and engaging (with a few adorable little creatures added in to gush over!) but the story is very involving. During Chihiro's quest, not only do we see she and Haku grew as characters but we learn much about Japanese mythology and the moral of how not everything is as it seems. The atmospheric and other-worldly quality of the film leaves the audience feeling as if they too have joined the young heroine in this strange new land where the impossible seems possible.Although this film will no doubt appeal to young children who will easily identify with Chihiro, there is a dark air to 'Spirited Away' that will draw in teenagers and adults. Certainly, older viewers will be left awe-struck by the intelligence and strength of the plot and the characters. Highly recommended to anime fans and those who are just looking for a film that is unique and interesting."
"It is rare that you find a film that will stick with you for the rest of your life, especially one as far from reality as Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away'. A true example of cinematic genius, this film appeals to people of all ages, and viewers will walk away with their minds still stuck in the land of spirits. The awe-inspiring animation and beautiful scenery will take your breath away every time you watch it, and it presents a believable array of characters that you will grow close to over the course of the film. If there is one film you must see before you die, I would say this definitely in the running."
"NOTE.. THERE MAY BE SPOILERS.. I AM NOT TRYING TO RUIN ANYTHING FOR ANYONE, BUT A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THIS MOVIE MUST NECESSARILY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS.. IT IS HOPED THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE, BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT, YOU MAY WISH TO JUST TAKE EVERYONE'S WORD FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS BRILLIANT AND NOT READ ANY FURTHER FOR NOW.Miyazaki is a genius and a true creator of Masterworks. ""Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"" is a perfect example of that genius, subtle and very powerful messages couched in enjoyable and visually beautiful form. One thing: Please don't use the incorrect Americanized title.. it removes a key issue from the movie, that of Duality, and Miyazaki wanted it there, or he WOULDN'T have titled it that way in the first place. One more thing: Watching the dub ruins the movie. If you want Disneyesque storytelling without content, watch the dub. If you want Miyazaki's movie, watch it in the original with subtitles, please..Miyazaki holds the same views in all of his work.. ecology is always at the forefront.. as it was in ""Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"".Spirited Away (for short) is important because it is the DUALITY that is at the core of the movie.. Duality.. Sameness.. what it is to be empty and how the hunger of emptiness can come to become an all encompassing NEED to ""swallow"" all that is around one.. That is saying something very significant about us. Miyazaki said that there ""is a little of No-Face in us all"" -- and that aspect of us, that ""No-Face"" with its hunger and need.. must find resolution. In Spirited Away, it was found through Zenobia, Yubaba's twin sister.. who gave No-Face the ""place"" he needed.. who gave that need and hunger that IS no-face, surcease, peace, finally.Greed is obvious, human greed, in simple aspects of the movie.. Chihiro's parents acting like ""pigs"" and in so, BECOMING pigs themselves. That's not overly subtle (although many miss it and thing it just a bit of humor), but it is powerful... ""be so, and you will become so"". Take what is not yours to take, and your punishment will be swift and unyielding.This carries over the environment as well.. and ties in nicely with two other factors.. the ""stink spirit"" which was NO STINK SPIRIT AT ALL.. but a powerful RIVER GOD.. who was so full of POLLUTION that he'd turned from something powerful and beautiful to a lumbering, stinking, barely able to move, thing of filth. That's a powerful image.When he is ""cleansed"" (by the small and innocent Chihiro who has done nothing wrong -- she is the innocent (yes, she's spoiled and a bit surly at the start, but she grows quickly. Painfully at times, but quickly.. almost losing her identity (again the duality theme.. She is both Sen AND she is Chihiro.. that's why the Japanese title referred to them BOTH as being ""Spirited Away"".When the River God is cleansed, you see what he REALLY is.. and he flies away, leaving Sen (for she is Sen at that time) a gift... a rare and powerful gift.Then we look at Haku.. Who, in the scheme of duality has LOST his other side, his true and other self.. you may recall that he was described as having changed and since he become Yubaba's apprentice, he has become ""more and more pale and steely-faced"" -- in other words, losing more and more of ""himself"" -- and yet, Yubaba is willing to simply discard him once he is bleeding and dying and ""of no further use to her""... but Sen/Chihiro WON'T let him die.Through the power of love, she brings him back -- only a love so strong could have saved him from the poisonous spell that was on the seal he stole from Yubaba's twin sister, Zenobia. But she over-rules that spell with her love, determination, and with the medicine, half of which she gave to No-Face to save HIM, and the other half of which she forces into Haku, to save HIM.. leaving her nothing to save her parents, but in the balance of ""whose need is greatest right NOW"" she acts correctly.Saving Haku.. and then helping him recover his name (and saving him in a more profound way by FREEING him.. as he freed her by giving her back her clothes and her card with her name on it.. she had almost lost herself at that point.. she'd forgotten her name.. results in him saving her as well.. They save each other.But WHY does Haku need saving? Because his river WAS FILLED IN. More Ecology.. we destroy, we pollute, we are GREEDY.. and the consequences are dire. Haku no longer has his river... the River God no longer can be clean due to our pollution.. and our greed turns Chihiro's parents into, LITERALLY, pigs..We *are* the pigs. We are greedy, we destroy, we pollute, we even ""stink"" (remember the references to Sen as ""smelling"" bad and no one willing to work with her because of her human ""stink""? That's very much to the point.. we stink because the things we do literally STINK.. we turn to black everything we touch.Miyazaki's message of duality, and ecology and salvation is very potent in Spirited Away... it's a very serious movie cloaked in the beautiful anime that makes watching it a pleasurable experience.. but if we just skim the surface and don't think about what is being said, we are as clueless and stupid as the parents who turn *themselves* into pigs.That too is a subtle message.. ""miss the point, and you're doomed to repeat it"". And turn yourselves into pigs.. or worse yet, remain as pigs."
"Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, or Spirited Away as the name is translated, is probably the best animated movie I've seen for a while.Summary of the story: Young girl Chihiro is is moving with her parents, when they stop for a while at place, which her father describes as old amusement park. But soon it is visible, that this place is no ordinary amusement park. When sun sets Chihro's parents turn into pigs and spirits, ghosts and ancient gods start to roam around in a place ruled by old witch Yubaba. Chihiro must rescue her parents and herself from eternal slavery in Yubaba's bath house.Not your typical Disney cartoon. And that is a compliment. No ready chewed, easy to point up moral codes, but more real grip from things. A line between good and bad is very vague line. Is Yuababa really a evil witch or is she just greedy old woman, who can learn from her mistakes? Do all bad deeds bring more sorrow, or can they sometimes bring something good? Chihiro grows, really grows during the story. She begins from a wimpy little girl and ends up to be brave, selfless girl, who ends up saving more --hmmm-- I think entities would be proper word in this case.But Chihiro is not the only one growing during the story, there is also a nameless spirit named no-face, who ends up finding peace thanks to Chihiro.There is also a young boy, Yubaba's apprentice Haku, who doesn't know who he really is. Yubaba is using Haku as a tool against her twin sister Zeniba.It is rare, that a single movie contains so much material. It is even more rare to see animated movies with such depth.Also for the acting, it's top notch, as is the animation. All backgrounds and characters are done with detail and passion.I really feel, that this is one of those must see movies for all animation fans."
"My sister lent me this movie over my winter break in December 2013. I had heard a lot of great things about it ever since I saw in it a Hollywood video store when was around eight or nine years old. On IMDb, it had an 8.7/10 back then, and the back of the DVD case had quotes like ""A masterpiece, pure and simple"" and ""Spectacularly inventive."" So, as you can imagine my expectations for this film were very high. I will start off by saying that I love anime and animation to their core. I grew up watching shows like Pokemon, Digimon, Avatar the Last Airbender, Dragonball Z, and cartoons on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network. Many times the creators of these delicate experiences are able to submit excellent messages of friendship, honor, perseverance, bravery, physical and mental strength, etc. Mr. Miyazaki is well-known in many anime fans' minds as a ""master storyteller"" or ""brilliant animator."" Unfortunately, in ""Spirited Away"", the hype undershoots the expectations.First problem: character development. When people in movies are not given enough background, emotion, and basic traits, the concern from the audience toward the characters tends to decrease or pique at a certain level. Sadly, the main character, Chihiro, is never really given any sufficient background outside of being the clichéd, bratty, spoiled child that is moving to a new house. Granted, throughout the movie, she does grow out of that, but the story never gives her time to expand on why she was like the way she was. As I was watching, I kept having a feeling of being completely disinterested in most of the actions and decisions that were taken and made by Chihiro.Second problem: plot and pacing. The story is not exactly the most original idea ever. The best way to sum up the story is like this: main character must persevere in order to get back home by using the power and strength they never knew they had. This plot hinders the overall message that is trying to be conveyed. Also, the story calls for plenty of problems and scenarios that seem very impeding to be solved all within a small time frame. In other words, they will all be dealt with in very convenient, rushed, unexplained, and ridiculous ways. For example, in a dream Chihiro has one night, she is in a barn screaming at the pigs (her parents), but she can't pick out which two pigs are her parents due to them all looking the same. Then, at the end of the movie, the antagonist gives her a test to pick out which pigs are her parents, and Chihiro is able to conclude in about ten seconds that NONE of them are her parents and, wouldn't you know it, she's right! This was the scene that made me pause the movie, stand up and say, ""Um, excuse me! Previous scene, anyone? She couldn't tell the differences between any of them in her dream. So, how is she just able to do the exact opposite after about a day or two?"" I guess this was intended to show how she's ""grown"" or ""matured"" since the beginning of the film, but it's really just a cold slap in the face of continuity and logic. In fact, many scenes don't seem to have any real bearing on the story or character development; they are just filler for any dorky fool out there looking for some eye-candy. It's almost like the movie is saying, ""Hey, we could delve more into our characters' stories, emotions, and motives, but we're just going to splash something pretty on the screen. It doesn't have to make sense or connect at all with the rest of the movie, so long as you are filled with a sense of awe."" Unfortunately, this leads into my next and final problem with this film.Third problem: the logic of the spirit world and the human world. In the beginning of the movie, Chihiro and her family get stuck in the spirit world because they apparently venture in at the wrong time or when the sun sets and night falls. Afterward, Chihiro can't escape for some reason. But, this raises several questions like ""Did she ever try to escape during the day?"", ""How can humans wander into the spirit world no problem, but once the sun sets, can't exit at all?"", ""Have any spirits gone out and entered the human world if there is no clear gateway between the two worlds?"", and ""Why do the spirits only come out at night when Chihiro first enters, but they are all up and at it during the day throughout the rest of the movie?"" I kept feeling like the writers of the film sat down and decided to make a by-the-numbers anime film, or just hit the points they needed to hit. For example, hit the beginning, character does this and that, magical junk in between, bad-guy-is-bad moment, weird-thing-or-obstacle-protagonist-has-to-deal-with moment, more magical junk here and there, all-problems-somehow-wrapped-up-toward-the-end moment, and character-reunites-with-family-and-lives-happily-ever-after moment. There is no flow nor segue of story; stuff just happens the way it's either supposed to or how it's written. This was by far my biggest gripe of all with the movie.To conclude, ""Spirited Away"" was alright, it wasn't great or terrible but average. The plot was incoherent, the characters were shallow and uninteresting, and the ""logic"" of the settings was completely ludicrous. It definitely won't be finding its way into my DVD/Blu-ray player anytime soon or even again, that's for sure. This movie could have been so much better if they had taken the time to putting thought in the right areas. It suffers so much from the reasons listed above and, in the end, fails to impress or even entertain at a decent level. It's a shameful predicament that will cast itself in the anime universe forever."
"Hey. It IS a well-done piece of social commentary. This is Animal Farm for Japanese environmentalists. Saying this is a ""kid's movie"" is like saying ANimal Farm is a kid's book. Well, maybe they could finish it, but they can't understand 2% of the intent.The issue: how can anyone who isn't Japanese or have a detailed knowledge of Japanese culture & mythology give this anything above a 5? Without that knowledge, it is impenetrable. I've lived in Japan, but except for the fact that my wife, Japanese with a degree from perhaps their #1 liberal arts college, could help me with reference's, I would've been scratching my head. People, without the background, who rate this highly are just jumping on the bandwagon. Go ahead, discuss Animal Farm without talking politics. Same thing."
"About ten minutes into 'Spirited Away' you realise that this movie is going to be totally unlike anything you've ever seen before - even the director's previous movies. Half an hour into the the thing, you feel like you're witnessing some sort of collision between Walt Disney and David Lynch. Put simply, 'Spirited Away' is damn weird - sometimes charmingly weird, sometimes excitingly weird, but sometimes just plain old what the hell is a 'stink spirit', and why does it have a bicycle stuck in its side type weird.
If you think that is supposed to be criticism, think again. 'Spirited Away' is every bit as incredible as the most incredible things written about it would have you believe. It simply transports you to a meticulously realised universe of spirits and mythology; a world utterly brimming over with fantastical sights and characters. The realisation of this whole mise-en-scene is a monumental cinematic achievement. You come out of the movie really feeling like you've just spent two hours in some incredible parallel universe.The attention to detail is staggering, the surprises endless (and I just mean every damn camera shot has something in it that will make your jaw drop to one extent or another), and somehow through this barrage of unheralded ideas the central character comes through rock solid, as do all of the supporting ones.That isn't to say that characterisation is the movie's long suite. Perhaps it's just a cultural thing, but it seems to me that even the best Japanimation doesn't _quite_ have the Disney capacity to make you fall in love with the characters. Or perhaps you could argue that Disney is just overly sentimental. In any event this is really the only very slight fault I could find with 'Spirited Away' - and it is slight, because there are scenes, particularly in the latter part of the film, which will bring a lump to your throat.One quibble: people keep saying how much better the animation is in this film than in Disney (well, Disney aren't even doing hand-drawn animation anymore, but you know what I mean.) I think they mean that the backgrounds and drawings are better. The animation - literally the movement from frame to frame of the characters - is not up to top notch Disney standards. Watch a car drive along the road in the early part of the film: it is conspicuously jerky, unlike the smooth panoramic, sweeping animation of Disney in the past decade. However, except in those very early scenes, it isn't very noticeable, and even if you did notice it, you would be so gobsmacked by the amazing, almost poetic backdrops in so many of the scenes that you'd soon forget about it.I guess I've picked a few holes in 'Spirited Away', haven't I?  That's why I'm only giving it a meagre 9.5 out of 10.0.  It's a masterpiece. See it."
"Some slight spoilersThis was supposed to be the greatest film by Hayao Miyazaki.  Sorry, but that's not really the case.  Princess Mononoke and Castle of Cagliostro are both better than this one.  The animation is good, although creepy at times, but this is probably intentional.  The music's forgettable though.  But the main problem with ""The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro,"" is all of the plotholes.  These ruin the film.  No Face leaves a huge, convoluted mess. Why is it so interested in Sen/Chihiro?  Because she let it in the bath house when it was raining?  Listen people, you can avoid confusion by just a few lines.  Also, Haku's story is also a mess, but something I don't want to get into right now.  There are also some scenes that were utterly pointless. The scene in which the water god(when it's that mud thing) comes does nothing to advance the plot.BOTTOM LINE:  A forgettable film that fails to have the same magic ""Castle of Cagliostro,"" did."
"How many people can sit through a 120-minute animated film? That's normally just too long for that genre. However, this one could meet that challenge. It only took me two sittings to make it all the way - that's very good, at least for me!The best part of the film was the color, stunning in parts, beautiful and with great detail. It also had some wild characters and a bit of humor here and there, which helped. Overall, a good mix of good and evil and a different kind of story.Being it's Japanese, you are going to get some different theology than you are accustomed to in the West (""the spirits of the wind and water have healed you,"" etc.) but it's not presented in a heavy-handed manner.I was concerned early on as the young girl - the main character in the film - had a shrill voice that was not pleasant but she calmed down after the first part of the film. Overall, entertaining and worth several looks."
"'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' is a cute story from a little girl called Chihiro, who is moving with her parents to a new place in the suburbs. During the travel,her father decides to take a shortcut along a lonely road. After getting out of the car and walking along a path for a while, they look to an abandoned city and stop in an abandoned restaurant full of food. Chihiro's mother and dad don't think twice and start to eat the food there, what Chihiro refuses to do. The night falls and that abandoned city become full of strange beings and spirits, and when Chihiro runs to her parents to go out of that place she discovers that they become pigs. A mysterious boy called Haku helps her and explains the situation to her,saying that she needs to get a job in the spa hotel for spirits and gods from Japan. The work is hard, but Chihiro does well. The problem now is to find a way to break the spell of her parents and go out from that strange ghost city...This anime is very different from the animes I already watched. The story is very touching and truly unique, with another world inside the world we know. I would love to watch an anime series based in chihiro's life in the ghost's world. Hayao Miyazaki has my profound admiration, specially because ''Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi'''is not the only movie he did that I love: I also enjoy a lot ''My Neighbor Totoro ''. Of course that I think that this movie is totally worthy of the Oscar it received. By the way, the idea that Chihiro and Haku could forever stay in Yubaba's possession if they forget their real identities is very interesting to me,since it is a reality: if you loose your identity and forgets who you really are, your interests and your focus, you become lost in the world. The maturity of Chihiro is another easy thing to see, and adds another interesting understanding of the story."
"Normally I am detested by Japanese Animated features. I come from a background of loving many of the old Warner Brothers cartoons, and saw Jap-Animation as a threat, along side of Mtv, Nickelodean, and Cartoon Network, ruining children's cartoons. (I really prefer not to elaborate because I don't want to push any buttons on this board.) But this movie was phenomenal, its very rare that I am impressed by modern cartoons now days but this film dazzled me so much that I had to rewind the film and watch it again the next day. There is so much neo-mythology and Post Alice Traumatic Stress Syndrome in this movie that I was tickled, honestly. There is a lot of imagination and colorful ideas and I wish that there can be many more animated pictures of this quality to come in the future - the movie resembled a lot of the wacky weirdness that were around in the old Betty Boop or Silly Symphonies cartoons, the animators really touched a chord in me and I thank them full heartedly."
"I will admit hesitation in viewing the latest Miyazaki film, simply because of my own close-minded first impression of it.  Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).  Therefore, after seeing that this film was more fantasy than reality, I was not in a hurry to see it. Unfortunately, this meant that I missed out on having seen a masterpiece for several months.  Spirited Away, the story of a little girl who must somehow escape from a world inhabited by fantastical characters is as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it is about the incredible creatures that surround her in her new environment.  While Spirited Away is a fairy tale, it is also a lesson in accountability, strength and responsibility. 	 Miyazaki is known for creating strong young female characters that are also completely adorable, but Spirited Away contains some of the most interesting co-stars I have seen in recent memory.  A lamp that not only provides a guiding light, but also happens to hop along on one foot, a giant baby and a bird with the head of an elderly lady are just three of the many eccentric characters we experience.  Not only are the characters and story line rich, but the artistry is absolutely beautiful as well.  The colors and character design are flawless and awe-inspiring.  Even I, the cynical and technical viewer found myself saying `Aww' and smiling at the little soot monsters and the `mouse'.  The hype was worth it and the Oscar was well-deserved.  Spirited Away is a beautiful film that really and truly should be experienced, and has the potential of being enjoyed by most, because it has so many layers and imaginative aspects that there will be points of appeal for just about anyone.--Shelly"
"I have some advice to anyone that hasn't seen this movie or did not like it but is attempting to watch it again: do not look at this movie the same way you look at western movies. This movie is meant to be a fable, and thus is chock full of metaphor. In fact, since it is set in the spirit world, EVERYthing is a metaphor. I don't want to impose my own views as to what those metaphors may mean, but it is important to accept, in a sense, that this movie doesn't have a plot. At least, not in the conventional sense. It would be better viewed as an exploration. Of what, I'll let you decide. Watch the movie, try to figure out what all the characters mean, why some are portrayed in a more favorable light and others not. It is also important to remember that, unlike western art in general, many of this movie's metaphors and messages have more than one meaning. I get the sense from reading the posts of other people, as well as some reviews, that many people have trouble realizing/accepting this. But, in my opinion, it is essential to move past this to truly enjoy and understand the movie and its message. The implication of this is also that it is impossible to fully understand the movie in just one viewing (or two, or many more). Like a painting, we are meant to look at this movie from different perspectives; close up and from far away and in different lights. All this is why I consider Spirited Away my favorite movie, and I hope that my advice will help some people see it in a different light. I don't claim to have all the necessary information to understand this movie, but rather I think I can help some people people who have trouble with this sort of movie and art enjoy it a bit more. So... have fun!"
"I, like most people, came to know Miyazaki's films by Princess Mononoke. When I heard of this film's release, I was beyond excited. I didn't expect it to beat Mononoke, but I expected it to be really good. I was mistaken. It is better than Mononoke. It isn't really good, it's an animation masterpiece. I was in tears, not because the movie was moving, or happy, but because I had never had such fun in a movie theater.Spirited Away is brilliant and vibrant, filled with the characters that nightmares and dreams are formed from. The animation is eye-popping to say the least...not just in color, sophistication or texture, but in MOVEMENT. The film flows like water, not like the stiff stone-like characters seen in most anime films, such as Ghost in the Shell or Jin-Roh. The film itself is so magnificently well-played...nobody in the film is really evil, but every step of the way is exciting.As for the dubbing, it was excellent...while ALL other anime films looked so silly in their dubbed forms, I think this film is nearly perfect...there were maybe one or two moments in the film when I was reminded that I was watching it in a different language than its original form.As a lover of fine cinema, animation plays a small, but vital, role in my passion. Spirited Away is amongst the best films in the medium...Miyazaki has proven himself to be a film-maker of diverse talent, and has launched himself into the first decade of a new millenium with a movie that is nothing less than timeless."
"This movie is a masterpiece. It is perfected into the smallest detail. This is definitely the best animated movie I have ever seen.When I looked at the cover of this movie I thought it looked kinda boring. But that was exactly the opposite of what it was. It is full of creatures you've never heard of, and even though it's not said it is a comedy, it is completely full-stuffed of totally hilarious moments.To name some of the great stuff in this movie: The characters are very worked-through and totally original, I have never seen such an example of imagination. There is no flat characters either, that means there are no such boring things as an all-the-way-through evil or good character.The story is also very original. If you just read the story here on IMDb it might not seem very special or interesting (I didn't have very high expectations on the movie after reading the backside of the DVD), but trust me, when things start happening, you'll find yourself completely stuck.This movie is a great example (and proof) that you don't need 3d or cool explosion effects to make a really great movie! If you haven't seen it, do it! NOW!"
"As a child, i have distinct memories of watching ""My Neighbor Totoro"", at the local movie theatre. I must say, that this movie is reminiscint of that feeling. It might just be the dazzling collaboration of computer animation, and the classic anime animation, but this movie is eye candy. That isn't the only great thing about it though. It has a very compelling story line, that goes up there with some other great films, that will forever hold a place in our hearts. Another dazzling feature in this movie, is the music. It perfectly mixes, classical, European music, and Japanese music, it its glory. I must say, that when i first saw this movie, i had no idea that it existed. That isn't in any way a problem though, considering that most originally Japanese movies aren't very well known in America. Overall, this movie is simply brilliant, and actually made me feel like a better person. It also includes many different, deep ideas, that actually caught my attention, and my heart strings, much more than anything that could come out of ""The Matrix"" or something. So, indeed, this movie is one of the greatest, which i have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I would completely recommend seeing it, and i am giving it a perfect 10/10."
"What makes this movie so powerful and great are mainly its characters. The characters are well constructed and are mainly the reason why this movie is so unforgettable. Some of the characters are quite odd looking, even by anime standards but they are so wonderfully constructed that they all become believable.The story is just totally brilliant. It's odd but oh so beautiful. The imaginary world gives the movie a totally unique and beautiful look and feeling. It all helps to make ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" an unique and unforgettable viewing experience. The beauty in the movie is in its unpredictability. Because its so unique and original, you never know what to expect next and everything comes as a pleasant surprise. My only complaint about the story is its love-story, if there even was meant to be one, wasn't really believable and felt underdeveloped and like a missed opportunity.It all is beautiful animated and with lots of eye for detail and I'm talking about both the characters and the imaginary world. It helps to make you believe in the totally imaginary world and the story.The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is just fantastic and fits the movie very well.This is once more another Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece. Once more he has succeeded in creating a unique, original and totally believable world, story and characters. It's both beautiful and unforgettable.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Undeniably an amazing art-style and a rich, immersive background score. Particularly so for a movie released in 2001.
However, I for one did not ""get"" the story. I feel like this movie is art which I have not understood. The plot left me feeling confused and unsatisfied."
"The spoiled and whiny girl Chihiro and her parents are moving to a small Japanese town in the countryside and Chihiro is missing her old house. Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives through a lonely land road with dead end in a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They cross the tunnel and find an abandoned cultural theme park on the other side with a ghost town.When her parents sees a restaurant with smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat to pay later; however Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to visit the place. She meets the boy Haku that tells her that her parents and she are in danger and they must leave the place. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. Further, the place is a bathhouse of spirits, monsters, gods and ghosts owned by the witch Yubaba. Now Chihiro counts on Haku to save her parents and return to their world.""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" is an entertaining and original Japanese fable with the supernatural and ambiguous journey of a girl named Chihiro to a world of witches, gods and ghosts the same way that Alice meets the Wonderland in Lewis Carroll's tale. Even the villains are lovable and the conclusion is open to the interpretation of the viewer. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Viagem de Chihiro"" (""The Travel of Chihiro"")"
"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. Seriously. The animation is amazing; and the plot is fabulous. I can't say this is a comedy, but a lot of the creatures were hilarious: the Susuwarti (fuzz balls), the bouncing green heads. Hayao Miyazaki has a way of doing that with most of his fantastic films. I just LOVE this movie!! Whoever hasn't seen it really should; nobody I know hasn't liked it. I just couldn't believe the animation...unbelievable, that's why! Some of it looks real! The first time I saw this, some parts made me jump, like the part where Chihiro's foot breaks through the wooden stair. Surprising! This movie was intensely good. Perfect!"
"Was on the old Atari forums one day and searching through the movie section of the forum and I saw a thread on a Spirited Away movie. I have always been a big fan on Anime; I like Cowboy Bebop, Bubblegum Crisis, Neon Genesis and Kenshin. So when I continued reading it got great feedback from my friends on there. So once it came out on DVD I rented it and I must say, one of the best animation movies I've ever seen. The passion in the movie is extravagant, the animation is beautiful and the voice acting is astonishing.The story is about a little girl named Chihiro and her family, they are moving to a brand new house. On there way to there house there dim-witted father takes a short cut which leads them to what seems to be a abandoned old style Japanese amusement park where traveling through they find some food. Even though Chihiro's objection the Parents stuff there faces, which strangely enough turns them into pigs. Things get worst, she loses her way she came back and there are ghost like spirits around her. Her only way to get her parents back is help out by a boy naked Haku. She must meet the main boss of the Bath House, Yubaba, to retrieve them back. She must work for her food and to fight to get her parents back. Along with getting her name back! The evil Yubaba changes it to Sin. On the way she meets a text book of characters featuring my favorite, No Face.The animation in this film is stunning, vibrant colors, stunning backdrops and character design are great! The voice work is done perfectly, bringing across the emotion that is written in this script. Famous anime director Hayao Miyazaki who won an Oscar for this masterpiece has done well and should be proud of his years of work. Which include movies like Princess Mononoke etc.I suggest if you want to see a powerful, moving and up lifting movie that make you forget its an animation film, watch this film ASAP!"
"I recently bought this on DVD for my 11 year old sister as a birthday present. The only real background info on it I had at the time was that it was an anime in the vein of Alice In Wonderland. However, in all aspects, (including the one that is most often in contention among anime fans, the English dub,) reached and then exceeded my expectations.Chihiro is a little girl who is unwilling to join in with her gung-ho parents who are setting off to live in a new town. However, when her father's bad driving has them at a dead end in a forest glade, they discover a tunnel that leads into what seems to be an abandoned theme park town. However, when the sun goes down it becomes clear that this is a ghost town of a different sort, a place where spirits return each evening to relax and refresh themselves. Chihiro finds herself working at the towering Bath-house of the Spirits and trying to find a way of getting back to her home, encountering many incredible creatures along the way, including the brave water spirit/dragon Haku, gruff but kindly boiler-man Komaji, cranky witch/owner of the bath-house Yubaba and the mysterious wraith No-Face.On the strength of the US English dub, it is an enjoyable and exhilarating film, with a well-written story, fantastic dialogue and, given the nature of the film, totally believable characters. Daveigh Chase is marvelous as Chihiro, and brings across her complex emotional states brilliantly. The supporting cast, including many Disney regulars, are on top form, and whilst it has no real stars on board, the skill of those involved proves it isn't necessary. I often found myself wondering if Wendee Lee was one of the cast members, but on discovering it was Susan Egan I felt like a complete dolt. David Ogden Stiers, the Peter Sellers of Disney, is a treat as Komaji, and Jason Marsden and Suzanne Pleshette are fairly engaging as Haku and Yubaba/Zeniba respectively. Bob Bergen and John Ratzenberger both make good cameos as well.The visuals and sound are crisp and clean and unpretentious, the story is accessible whilst still being quirky and inventive. Whilst at the time of it's release I was repelled by the fact that it seemed a tad too Disney-ish, I now think I can safely say I was wrong. This isn't Alice In Wonderland; it's in a whole different class.And by the way, my sister loved it too."
"Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a surreal, entertaining, and refreshing film for adults (not for kids who may find it weird). It portrays a very colorful cast with a simple plot line. It transports viewers to a dreamy land of super-natural, makes it a little frightening, yet because of the main character's innate innocence (she being a child), adult viewers are reminded how to be kids again...in another light. In the end, Miyazaki's constant message (it appears to be an ongoing call) prevails: protect our environment. :)Like all of Miyazaki's films, it is an expected hit, not only for its intricate plot line, but also for the name of the director himself. Attach Miyazaki's name, and Japan comes lining up. Too bad for America though, since they have yet to line up for a film that actually conveys a worthwhile message. Animations films in America are still equated for the kids' market, and it's a pity that it is still being marketed for them without considering animation as a distinct genre for all market groups."
"Chihiro and her parents are driving to their new house. She's upset to leave her old friends and school. When her father gets them lost in the woods, they stumble across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off and is sucked into a bath-house in a new world, a world of spirits. Chihiro is guided by Haku, henchman of the witch who controls the bath-house. The two of them work hard together to help Chihiro escape and rescue her parents. The youngster proves herself to be as independent as any spirit and fights through many distractions and inconveniences to return to her own world. Even though she's scared and upset, she makes some close friends among the eccentric characters she meets.I've loved Miyazaki's work as long as I have known it but nothing compares to the experience of Spirited Away. I had not heard of the movie and had seen no trailers, so the unexpected animation was almost perfect. The characters were quite unique and no sane viewer would refuse the offer to follow the child in her enchanting adventure.For years, I've always thought that one of the most important factors of a good movie is the way the title is presented at the beginning and there is no better example to prove my point than in this film. The music is completely overwhelming, especially the attractive sequence displayed at the beginning and repeated throughout.There is very little criticism available, only that it's possible that the unique imagination of Hayou Miyazaki is not appreciated to the extent it should be by the viewers.I've read other reviews and think it's unfair to compare the work with Disney's as the last thing I would call this feature is a 'children's' movie. The two styles are aiming at different audiences and both succeed."
"miyazaki has had my attention since i saw laputa when i was 5, my neighbour totorro when i was 10 and porco rosso when i was 12. i tried to find as many of his films as i could and thought he could never beat his masterpiece: princess mononoke, but low and behold hes done it again. this is quite simply the most magical experience you will ever have. the animation is so awe inspiring and so breath taking that it literally brings tears to my eyes every time i watch it, its that amazing. the story is simple yet incredibly complex. a young girl of 10 or less is moving to a new home and is not looking forward to it at all, one might say shes spoilt quite well as she wines and complains when she doesn't get her own way. the family takes a wrong turn and the young girl is left all on her own in a bizarre world inhabited by spirits and witches. her parents are turned into pigs and she has to find her parents and some how escape this place which is ruled by a powerful witch known as yubaba.what follows is a magical tale of friendship, love and the steady growth of a young spoilt girl into a brave selfless little lady with courage and strength she never knew she had. as she begins working in the bath house things change for her as she becomes more independent and more able to use her wits and cunning to eventually free her self from yubabas control.it wisks you steadily away with chihiro into a wonderful world of colour characters and real enduring ideals. miss it and you honestly will hate yourself when your older. 100/10 well worth the best animated feature Oscar and it should've been nominated for best movie i feel. masterpiece."
"I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case it is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are drab and cold or sullen and the script is nothing to get me interested at all. The kookiness is all that I can see to attract people. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion."
"As a huge fan of both animation and Japanese cinema, I have long felt more than a little embarrassed by my ignorance of celebrated director Hayao Miyazaki. Having tried to rectify this situation somewhat by watching the highly acclaimed animé Spirited Away, I no longer feel so bad about neglecting his work for so long: I found the film hugely undeserving of the glowing praise heaped upon it and I imagine it'll probably be quite a while before I tackle another of Miyazaki's 'classics'.Although Spirited Away is undeniably impressive visually, with stylish animation and imaginative design throughout, everything else about the film leaves A LOT to be desired, especially the trite story, in which a little girl, Chihiro, gets lost in a strange world and encounters a series of whimsical fantasy characters while trying to find her way home. It's The Wizard of Oz, but without the star quality of Garland, the amazing flying monkeys, catchy tunes, cute dog, and over-sexed dwarfs in garish outfits; it's Alice in Wonderland without the pungent whiff of opium; it's Labyrinth without the allure of a teenage Jennifer Connelly, the star power of Bowie, and the magic of Henson; it's Coraline, but.errr nowhere near as good (speaking of Neil Gaiman, it reminded a lot of Mirrormask, which also bored me to tears with its random, meandering narrative)."
"This move..was like the best freaking movie I've ever sat through, the sound and the picture is just stunning. It gave me so many memories, and its so exciting. Watch this movie when your sad, bored, or just hyper, and it will throw you into a world of wonder and awe. The times of silence in this movie are fun and soothing, and the times of excitement are fast and involving. You can watch this movie time and time again, and still never get bored. Its almost like your soul thirsts to watch the movie, its neither bad or lacking. You get a feel for the characters as they move through the vast world that it set out before their very eyes. You might just explode of enjoyment...i would no its happened to me several times"
"Here I find myself again reviewing another great Miyazaki movie. Spirted Away in my opinion is probably the second best Miyazaki movie to date with Grave of the Fireflies in first and Naussica in third. Spirted Away is a great movie for kids and adults alike. I found that it was not very scary, but some moments your kids might find more frightening then others. In this film it doesn't seem to have much of the nature mixed in with the plot, though when Chihiro meets the River Spirit he has tons of trash inside of his body, which is what Miyazaki saw in a river my his city while he was walking. It is rated PG for scary image. I give it a 9.25 out of 10."
"Remniscient of his fellow Japanese animator Satoshi Kon, Hayao Miyazaki offers us a good bath of Japanese folklore, suited in a well edited, fast paced, americanized form of animation. Miyazaki is more than a director, he's a writer. He's that kind of director that never leaves any kind of detail behind in quest to make a movie look over the top. This one was magnificent. Despite being billed as a child movie, well it ain't one, it's one of the most colorful audacious and creative anime ever made.The setting of the plot, from the start, makes room for creativity. Trapped in a spirit world, Chihiro has to grow as a person to fight the dangers on her way back to normality and back to her parents. In an avalanche of obstacles that rivals any literary epic, Chihiro grows a willpower that will go beyond of what she every imagined. Spirited Away is the epitome of true cinema. It exploits the possibilities and the variables that cinema has to offer. Every choice Miyazaki makes for his movie is the good one. Truly astonishing.So make the good choice too, buy this movie."
"highly philosophical and deeply profound. I've seen this film for more than 5 times now and each viewing is still a new experience. It makes one reflect on family relations, growing up, embodiment, and one's name (so philosophical that it borders on not being able to be understood by the audience). If you're not in it for the insight, fill yourself with the beautiful graphics and display of colors. Spirited Away is a visual delight transporting you to a totally different world of spirits, spells, and magic. It is so realistic that one may get that spooky feeling after watching the movie (I did feel this because of No-name). The art complements the story; the animation gives life to the plot.Spirited Away is a wonder--the best of the best Miyazake animation films. With so many subplots, the film is able to sew together every bit of information and symbol it has solid tight. Every question answered, every character full of meaning. Sometimes, animation is better than real life. Spirited Away sure is a winner."
"I have seen many anime movies made by Hayao Miyazaki, such as PRINCESS MONONOKE, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF WIND, LAPUTA: CASTLE IN THE SKY, etc. He's movies are all very meaningful and there's no word to describe how I feel watching these movies! He's just that good. While FEW PEOPLE may think it's not a good movie, it's only because they don't understand it. They have no clue about Japanese culture and they aren't very open-minded about it either. After seening all these anime movies, my desire to know everything about Japanese only increases.All Miyazaki's films are wonderful and special, and each of them have deep meanings which only those who try to see it will understand the point of the movies.Spirited Away has colorful, and extremely detailed arts in it, and the characters and their actions made them seem so real! It is a movie about how an immature, ten-year-old girl who, by accident, got into the spirit world with her parents, whom are turned into pigs because of greed. In order to save them, she must become a worker in the bathhouse for Gods. Throughout the movie, you meet interesting and fun characters, such as the tiny dust balls, they're just so cute! Chihiro, the little girl, must learn to be strong in order to survive and rescue her parents with the help of a dragon boy, Haku. The movie is really wonderful and I have seen it many times.I'm really sad to hear from some people that he's not going to produce any of his own anime films any longer. (They are so good!) I really appreciated all his works, and I feel so lucky to get to see many of his movies! May Studio Ghibli live on forever!"
"This film works well with childrenbut works wonders with adults. Much like ""Alice In Wonderland"", it revolves around a world which appears to be extraordinary  but at the same time reflects many aspects of our own society, and the human nature. Miyazaki's quality of animation is brilliant as usual, much like his vision to create something so creatively profound, entertaining and intensely symbolic. A perfect example of the latter is an appropriately named character called No-Face. To me he appeared to be a reference to the many socially insecure people out there, who stay in the shadows but secretly crave for friendship. When Chihiro behaves in a warm manner with him, he is so overwhelmed that he becomes desperate to seek her attention and to make her happy in any way possible. Another symbolic aspect I found towards the end of the movie, was when Haku strictly told Chihiro not to ""look back"", until she had come out of the cave. This instantly reminded me of a Greek myth I had read as a child, - whereby a man who had gone to depths of Hell to bring back his dead wife, was instructed to do the same, but failed to comply due to his doubtful nature. Perhaps Miyazaki wanted to imply that by ""looking back"", Chihiro would have unknowingly expressed a hint of regret and this might have enabled Yu-Baba to seize her back into the magical land. Of course, there is also the rather abrupt ending  which I had found a bit weird at first but when I thought about it I realised that it was most probably done on purpose, to maintain an element of mystery in the viewer's mind, as to whether Chihiro and Haku were ever able to meet again or not. All said and done, I did have one complaint with the movieconsidering the story involved an extraordinary, magical land there was an enormous amount of scope and although I found the movie to be very intriguing  I feel that it could have been even more adventurous and exciting. That's just me. On the whole though, I can't deny the fact that this is one of the most unique, enthralling animation experiences I've ever had. My Final Rating: 8.5/10."
"Sorry but I don't see the reason of the enthusiasm for this movie. The history line has no head or feet, the escatological scenes get tiresome, the ending is facile and predictable and even hurried. In general it reminds one of the countless drivel that Manga aficionados are so fond of, one more of the apparently unending carbon-copy characters that we have got used to.The movie has a hint of pretentiousness that never really catches on, at the end is more of the same weird idiomatics that every single manga caricature has used to the point of exhaustion: the perfect girl with no fault on her character, the absent parents, the hero that saves her (and that in a convoluted turn of events has saved her before) and the loads of wackos that look mostly repulsive.It is an OK movie for children with strong stomachs (I wonder if their attention could be fixed for this long) but as a cinematographic experience it lacks all the ingredients of a respectable movie."
"This is probably the best animated film ever, it is powerful an unique and very fun. You definitely should see it, in the movie a little girl is transported to a magical world where her family has been turned into pigs by an evil witch who runs a spirit bath. The little girl must work for the witch and plot ways to get her parents back with the help of some friends she makes. The world she enters is the most incredible world ever conceived and i mean that, If you have not seen other movies the director of this film has made you should they are very very good, some include, Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery service and most recently Howl's Moving castle which is now in theaters any way this is a very good film that you should rent when you get around to it which you probably won't"
"What this movie does so well, and why i love it so much, is because it takes me to a completely different world, so beautifully drawn and so magically in every single aspect and filled with wonderful characters that makes this film, like no other film, leave me with an inner joy that is indescribable.The only thing i truly hate about this film, is that I'm always so disappointed when it's over, and I'm left in this boring inferior world called ""reality"" again.Anyways, if you for some weird reason haven't watched it yet, i got one advice for you:Watch it. Now."
"This is the first ever anime I have ever cried at. Ever. Honestly, this movie teaches us lots of life lessons and about growing up. The animation is also great. Plus, this is my first Miyazaki film I have seen so I'm quite impressed.This movie is so much better than the current Disney films and though the animation isn't as good, but the detailed world is far more fascinating. I really feel that I've learned tons from 'Spirited Away' and for me, it means a lot.So far, this is the only other anime I've liked since Inuyasha and Naruto and it's the first ever movie version of one. I am very impressed by how well Miyazaki did for it.My favourite scenes are the time after Haku and Chihiro see Chihiro's parents in the flower field and the scene at the end. This movie is also in easy Mandarin so for those who aren't fluent with it can easily catch on.Overall, this is the perfect movie if you just feel down on life or when you think that you want to just see a good movie. It's one of the best I've ever seen and I definitely recommend it to you.Scored: 10/10"
"'Spirited Away' is a Japanese film, and is available in the UK in dubbed & subtitled versions. I saw the subtitled film and (with the exception of occasional gaps & pauses in the subtitling) I judge it to be the best animation since Akira, or possibly even Pinnoccio. The storyline is (in outline) no more incredible than most anime, but the film excels because it is bursting with unusual ideas. The imaginative imagery is wedded with fine, detailed animation and evocative music. Some parts of the film (chases/drives through foliage/flowers/within the bath-house) are exceptionally detailed and visually striking. There are (thankfully few) portions of the film soundtrack that suffer an outbreak of a Richard Clayderman-esque piano composition (IMO), but generally the sound supports the animation well and the animation was continually stimulating and moving. I give this (original film with subtitles)  9 OUT OF 10."
"All I can say about this film is. . . I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people.  Answer me this.  They take so much time to do detailed back grounds, which are beautiful, but are hidden by the grotesque characters that seem to all look the same to me, no matter what kind of anime.  I found myself being lost in the plot several times, with very poor character development, and apparently hyperactive dubbing.  What I mean by that is, how come everything they say, not matter what it is, comes out all in one rushed, messy breath.  Though, I did find this movie rather a comedy. My brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall.  That was pretty funny, I must say.  The only reason why we went to the movie in the first place was because my brother recieved credit extra credit for his college class for watching it. What a waste of over 2 hours of my life!  I could have been sharpening pencils, or making paper airplanes! Also, I found that there were characters that seemed to play no part at all.  Example:No face.  Ok, so he is the bad guy for about, 5 minutes, but then has no real purpose for being in the movie.  What is with that guy anyway.  Eeesh!  I have nightmares about that one. . . In conclusion, I just want to say, that through out this on going movie, I was ended up multipul times getting lost and confused.  My eyes also started to hurt after watching the choppy animation move across the screen.  I give this movie, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best, I gets a big, fat 1, or maybe a zero.  No, one.  I liked the backgrounds and things that they actually spent time on. . . It is too bad Disney had to take part in this film. . ."
"I'm sorry, but this movie is slow, boring and even stupid. a thousand of idiots creatures don´t make a good film. I think that it's the most overrated film of 2002. ¿8'7?  ¿the best animation film ever made?......JAJAJAJAJAJAJA."
"I find it hard to believe that anyone rates this film at all. Not one minute of this makes any sense. The animation is not as artistic as the fans of anime would have it. The story is ridiculous and the execution poor in the extreme. Anime is not my favourite form anyway but a good story is a good story especially if it is well executed. This garbage is neither a good story or well executed. It is as though some anime guy has just completed a bad LSD trip and committed it to film. There is no explanation of any happenings in the movie and all sorts of things happen surreal and otherwise and are just left to hang in the air. Pseuds would say that is the ""art"" in it. I say it's just daft and confusing for the viewer. There is little or no emotion in this endeavour either. Girl has parents turned to pigs-why? Maybe it makes more sense in the subtitled version than the dreadfully dubbed version but I doubt it very much. Another thing I hate about anime is the insistence in denying the ""Japanese-ness"" of the characters. They are drawn as westernised as any Pixar or Disney character. The only clue to its ethnic origin is the costume and backgrounds. All the kudos heaped on this tosh is a severe case of The Emperor's New Clothes. Avoid this rubbish , it is time you will never get back."
"Rightfully named the greatest Japanese animation director, Miyazaki delivers again. This movie is definitely his masterpiece. Every single aspect (at least the good ones!) that you could possibly imagine is present and accounted for.After seeing Princess Mononoke, I sincerely believe Miyazaki to be gifted. Be careful in making wrong judgments just because it's an animation (hence a ""kid's movie"" according with the stereotypes); trust me, this movie will puzzle you beyond reason and it's much more effective in doing so than 99% of the so called ""real"" movies. Real life has never been so well depicted.. the story is pure fantasy, but the feelings, speeches, reactions are genuinely human.Perhaps most of you don't know (or just don't care), but every great hero/leader had his doubts, disbelieves and moments of weakness. What made them great, was not the absence of such feelings, but the will power to move forward when every single bone in their body told them to run for cover...And that, my friends, is exactly what this movie is all about.See it. I promise you it's time well spent."
"The tale of the Chihiro, the small girl who finds her self in a strange and daunting spirit world working to save her parents and return them all to the world from which they have come. Not knowingly seen or heard of Miyazaki's work before ( although it takes a few times for a name to penetrate my consciousness), I was without preconceptions about the film apart from my friend's ""It's really good!"" as she handed the DVD to me as a birthday present. I have to agree with her. This film rocked. Appealing, I should say to many age groups, (I saw it with my mum and some 30 something year old friends), it in turn scared, startled, moved me, made me smile and laugh and warmed the deepest cockless of my heart. This has everything from adventure and mythology(Japanese of course) to friendship and love. I was with the little girl and her friends every step of the way. It is a bizzare film but very watchable and completely enchanting. The animation is much softer than the usual Japanese Manga style of cartoon, and the tale certainly not as bloody. (Barely bloody at all) I saw the American dubbed version and the Japanese, subtitled version one after the other, and I prefered the latter. A good film, when well subtitled, leaves you with the feeling of actually having heard the characters say the words in English, and this was the case with this film. The translation in the 2 versions were not the same and to me some of the subtleties in the Japanese version were lost in the American version were there was the added pressure of having to syncronise the words to(cartoon)lip movement. There were also some cultural adaptions from the Japanese version to better suit an American audience, which I prefered without.  Having said that, the American(English) version stands successfully in it's own right. My friends(& mum)who only watched the American version thoroughly enjoyed it. The DVD extras such as interviews with Miyazaki and the American director/producer? and the lead up to the Japanese release made fun watching too. Some of it just to get a little peek into the life/hard work/mad stresses behind making the film. I gave it a 10."
"A wonderful, wonderful movie! You don't often see movies that fill you with warmth and happiness. This is one of them though. I had not too high (but not low) expectations of an animated Japanese movie, but I was soon charmed by the brave little girl Chihiro and fascinated and swept away by her adventures. The characters are complex and there are mysteries that don't get explained in the movie, which is nice for a change. In most children's movies we get to see these days, every thing is laid out bite-sized, and nothing is left unexplained. Spirited away is much more daring in that respect. And with right: children do not need to see everything explained, they can enjoy a story just as much if it is mysterious.I give this movie a 10 because it managed to transport me to a fairy tale world and bring me back happy and content. I still think of it at times, even though it was a while back I saw it."
"Spirited Away is an amazing movie.  I've been getting so used to animation getting increasingly graphically detailed with computer-aided animation (Beauty and the Beast) or computer animation (Pixar stuff) that I forgot how good simple animation can be.  Like much Japanese artwork, a lot can be said with simple strokes of a brush.  Details here are applied to the areas they are required and not where they are unneeded.  This helps focus the eye and alleviates the nonstop detail that tends to numb you after an hour of a Pixar flick (although I love them all too).I loved the creativity of it.  Since I'm a Westerner, it probably seems even more creative and new to me since I'm not used to dragons and spirits. Accordingly, the color palette seemed unique as well which made the movie seem fresh.I'll agree with what others said about the movie being more of an uncontrolled wild ride rather than a plot, but that was OK for me."
"I don't tell you this particularly to sell the movie, but maybe to come to grips with how utterly HAUNTING this movie is to me, and I'm still trying to figure out why.  I bought the DVD before I'd ever seen it (and didn't even watch it for a few days), but once I hit ""Play"" I've been hooked ever since. I have trouble going three days without watching it, and I'm enlisting my friends to watch the movie, but secretly so that I can have an excuse to watch it again.  I'll watch it dubbed or subtitled, it doesn't matter. I'm sick, and I don't want to get well.Story?  Great.  Animation?  Stellar.  But that shouldn't be enough to enslave me to Miyazaki's vision.  What then keeps me coming back?  Well, I have one theory...There's something about Chihiro that is utterly real, moreso than an in-the-flesh actress, even.  The way she runs, or cries, or sulks, or clings to her mother, I don't know how Miyazaki captured it all, but as Chihiro grows, I feel like I'm growing with her.  To me, that's why it's cheap to compare SA to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland; Dorothy and Alice are flat characters, while Chihiro is in my eyes a genuine 10-year-old child. My heart roots for Chihiro.Yeah, maybe I'm lame, but I'll tell you this.  When I think about Hollywood's cookie-cutter punchline movies these days, I barely even feel temptation to attend.  Why sit through the latest mediocrity (or sequel to mediocrity), when I can just throw SA back in the DVD player and get my guaranteed movie magic?My name's earlsleek, and I'm an SA junkie."
"I have built so much love up for Spirited Away over time that I can't even begin to explain it. Miyazaki has made this film with such integrity and grace that you can't look away from it's unbelievable charm and amusement. This was the first Miyazaki I had seen, and by far it is equally as great as the others and is also, like the rest are, one of the most admirable and lovable animations I have ever seen.To start off, the movie itself from start to finish is entertaining, clever and fun in every way. I really grew to love and care for almost every character because even though he doesn't take that much time to describe some of them in every little detail, the way he uses his time to show their personalities is excellent and you almost practically know them from the first time they're shown. He also gives his characters great depth as the movie goes on, and even though Chihiro was a bit annoying at the get go, you actually start to feel sorry for her and love her as you do most everyone because their traits and characteristics are so splendidly displayed.Also, the humor and plot he manages to work with are brilliant and fascinating, even if it's meant to be a little childish and inane every now and then, it totally works! He throws weird and eccentric surprises one after another that always keep you on your feet and guessing what's going to happen next, and he manages to get giggles and smiles from the kid-quality jokes and antics because they're so well done and delivered at the right times!I truly have to praise Miyazaki for the artforms that are his sensational, remarkable, undeniably acclaimed animations and I have to say that as a director, he's growing to become one of my favorites for perfect examples such as Spirited Away. I could go on, but I really don't know how else to explain how phenomenal this masterpiece really is, so I suggest you see it if you haven't, and watch it again if you didn't like it, because I'm hopefully positive it will manage to titillate your senses in some way, or form, as it certainly did me. This comment hardly even begins to do it justice that it's that spectacular. Trust me."
"What else can I say? It was such an enjoyment to watch. Everything was new, fresh, and surprising. The animation alone set an instant and unique atmosphere. The music matched perfectly, with a drawing sense of mystery. The story was fantastic - a sort of darker, unknown wonderland. The characters were given an abundance of individuality which colored the story with further brilliance. Over all, a classic animation for all ages, which deserves every ounce of praise that is given to it. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to set their imaginations free into the limitless world of fantasy, where there is always a sense of blissful escape from the rough reality around us."
"Spirited Away is one of those movies that leaves you with a lingering sense of wonder and happiness as the credits roll. It is one of a handful of movies that after the first viewing, I'm ready and willing to watch it again immediately. I am not an anime fan; I watched this simply due to the rave reviews, and I'm so happy that I did. The only problem now is getting others to watch it (""I HATE anime!"" they usually reply.)This is not the anime I thought it would be... ie., no exclamation marks flying from characters' heads, or giant eyes or overly-dramatic reactions. It's much different from the Cartoon Network anime you might catch as you flip channels. It's a real art form. There were moments of beauty that I can't describe, like the camera soaring over the water-covered railroad tracks with the setting sun reflecting off the water.I don't recommend movies on a whim; showing a person a movie is like giving them a gift, so I'm always careful about what movies I show to certain people; I can't think of a single person to whom I wouldn't want to show Spirited Away.If you let yourself get caught up in the magic, it is a magical experience."
