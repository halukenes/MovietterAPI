"Apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. Based on the novel ""Hearts of darkness"" by Joseph Conrad this film is not so much about the Vietnam war, it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. Apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle, the duality of man, consisting of morality, the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.The film has a simple premise, US Army Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into Cambodia through a river, to assassinate a renegade, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. It's an accessible premise, allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers, and yet this film is anything but shallow. It's a journey into madness and hysteria, an observation into the darkness of humanity. I could write a book analysing this film, there's just so much to talk about. My interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find Kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie, dehumanization. The journey through the river is also reminiscent of Dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. There are three major stops before Kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought, as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.The first stop is with lieutenant Kilgore. That stop shows that Kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. Their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. In one scene of the movie, the ""heroic"" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies, Captain Kilgore uses Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures Valkyries, he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. At this stage, although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy, they still understand the innocent.The second stop is the USO show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. At this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself, becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. The soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. Now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.
The last stop before Kurtz is the Do-long Bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far, he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.The final stop on the journey is Kurtz, at this point only Willard and Kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness, the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. Kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. Bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is, filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. Willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. He kills Kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. In the end Willard has a choice, succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken Kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon, he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving Lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe, he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. Both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't, they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.The film presents this study of the human psyche through Carmine Coppola's eerie score, hypnotic images, and some haunting scenes, essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. It's here where Coppola succeeds the most. His ability to create a living ""hell"" is so amazing, and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. It provides a commentary on war and religion, making the subtext even vaster. The film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat, and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner, conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. Coppola's direction transcends itself, the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows, most notable during Col. Kurtz's first appearance. The troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all, and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. Apocalypse Now is beautifully haunting, utterly hellish, terrifyingly intelligent, and magnificently wrought, it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war, but also its meaningfulness and beauty. Not only is this one of the best films ever made, it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. It is Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. Rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon, immortal for its contribution to cinema, and a truly unforgettable experience, Apocalypse Now is cinema at its most complete, crystalline and pure."
"My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie"
"Top 20 war moviein Redux they added long scenes that changed tempo of movie.
The one at the plantation didn't work well in context.
What a great film!"
"Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels.Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors ""The End"" as Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to ""terminate... with extreme prejudice"" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is ""out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior.Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz's.Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard.I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend.That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis."
"I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said "" was "" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam "" he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novelMy all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb"
"Edit:
With a lot of work I did set up an extra page for the final cut in July.
Took me an entire day, because of tedious rules.
It was meant to separate the different version in their ratings.
But I M D B decided without even having the courtesy to notify me to simply re-merge my page into this one - and therewith wasted all my efforts.I also did put a lot of work here into correcting false Trivia etc...
But instead of any apprecciation, I get censored by I.M.D.B often
also without notification or explanation why,so I now feel that we reviewers are treated as ""useful !d!ots"", doing all the work, whilst some algorithm simply throws out anything without regard of wasting people's life-time.Now it is the end of August and I think I had it with this site and won't pour any of my heart-blood into it anymore.
- -Here is my original review for the Final Cut version:Looking at the reviews for the original version I noticed that many 1 star reviews did not dislike the original movie, but the Redux version.
Unfortunately they therewith dragged down the original movie's ratings which gives a distorted impression.
So in order to give everyone of you the opportunity to rate and review the original and the final version separately I did create this page.And now I explain to you why I give this movie the top rating:To me the reason why this movie is a classic is that it draws one into a total different world, by first engaging our emotional involvement, until the viewer comes out somewhere different and somehow changed.The way it does that, is to straight away throw us into the total senselessness of a life, which was conditioned to find its purpose in fulfilling missions
only to then having none.This is the conflict between fulfilling what is in your heart and machine-like ""performing ones duty"",
and what I like about it, is that Coppola did not merely talk the talk, but really walk the walk himself:He did pour all his heart blood into it - from financial risk, via encountering tremendous adversities, up to a huge production time he likely never did anticipate before:
Just read the Trivia of Apocalypse Now (1979), it reads like a drama in itself!
This shines through and gives this movie an authentic flair.A mainstream movie would display initial difficulties, but only to move onto a new found reason to live for (either driven by one's career or romantic love); and then end happily with the revival of purpose and excitement.
But for Apocalypse Now the deconstruction of the ego is just a starting point into an apocalypse of a false identity which mistakes the self with role one plays in society.It does that by hurling us from one absurdity into the next;
and the reason why art is in this case is better than a documentary, is because it does it without any judgment, but by chasing us frantically through bubbles within the chain of command where ethical rules don't apply:
a void of power, abused by the uncontrolled madness of immaturitythe world of war.As often is the case in art, it is unclear whether the creators were fully aware of the implications of their work; but whether intended or not,
the psychological effect of this movie is to hype up the viewers' tension and adrenalin; only to have their invested willpower shattered repeatedly by nonsensical decisions with tragic consequences.That's why even after 40 years, this movie does still hold a great value,
because it is a reflection of the stupidity of societies's values to simply function,
instead of finding ones own true personality within.
Such a movie could be made in the rebellious anti-war 70s, but in this decade of oblivious consumerism and vanity would hardly have been financed or noticed
(not even to mention todays many butthurt viewers, whenever their politics is criticised or the political correctness of the hour is not catered for).The part, however, which mesmerises me most is the conclusion drawn by one character to step out of this rat-race-madness in order to build a quite literal own realm with all the fascination and charisma gained, as soon as one doesn't allow to be squashed into the box of nonsensical norms anymore.So in a way you get multiple movies here in one:
A phoenix-like revival,
one about the irrationality and atrocities of war,
one about the cultural clash between the occupying and occupied forces
(the french discussions alone could serve as a short-movie),
and a journey into the mystical world of an irrepressible free spirit.I left the cinema and felt like coming home from a long journey.And as for this specific version:
Even though I am not best qualified to judge in comparison, because I only can remember parts of the original and have not seen the Redux version,
my feeling is that this is an excellent compromise between bringing us all important scenes, which were cut out in the first one,
whilst not to try the viewers patience too hard with an overlong version.Regardless of my subjective opinion, one thing is certain:
Due to the most modern restoration to highest possible standards,
the sound and picture quality of this version are objectively the best of all versions and fully live up to 2019-sounds and 2020-visions."
"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. ""Why would you like a film that's so confusing?"" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted ""standards"" of death and destruction (Am I the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????), so they send the ""Conformity Police"" out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have 'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!"
"During the final throes of the Vitnam war, our central character, Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has allegedly gone 'completely insane', but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country.The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this.Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened lair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner, his unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us, the next generation, the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam, is mind-expanding stuff.The bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard,--interlaced with some of his own horror stories, is incredible, nay, genius, film. The closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols. Coppolla has made, intentionally or not, the ultimate anti-war statement, one that should resonate through the ages."
"This movie changed the art of film making, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. The film uses music not as a score laid in later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten."
"'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to 'terminate the position' of Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army, setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers. Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men, and along the way, they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations. 'Apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The running time of 'Apocalypse' is over three hours, but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived, I was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed. The beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me, however. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The 'Godfather' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone, and shadows created the feeling of a Baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible usage of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, almost become a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes, and come across a tiger. The sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost a muted grey, the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly striking. Another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small village while playing Wagner. This could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene, but instead Coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene, with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to 'scare the hell out of them'. The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film, and the amount of trouble he caused. Regardless of this, he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time. Sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time I have seen him really unleash in a film  and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al) but I knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now' so I cannot compare it to this newer cut, but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced. 8/10--Shelly"
"In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy. Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad. Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny. However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.That Redux was going to be anything less than brilliant was never in doubt: it was never going to be so different from the original that it would destroy or significantly damage the reputation or impact that the film has. What was in question to my mind was whether or not Coppola should have just left well enough alone.  I have seen the documentary about the making of the original film, wherein Coppola derides many of his scenes and decides to cut them out of his movie even as he finishes shooting them - the plantation scene being one of the key ones that he felt just didn't work.  It was for this reason that I was interested to see what the additions and rejigging of scenes had done to the film.The strengths of Redux is that Apocalypse Now was never about the straight story, it was more about the journey Willard undertakes rather than a build up to a traditional conclusion - while the ending is big, it is no more or less important that anything that has gone before it.  So for that reason it is a good thing that, simply put, there is now more of the journey to be enjoyed!  `49 minutes of new material' my dvd cover screams at me; combine this with the movement of scenes and certainly it does have the feel of a different (albeit familiar) film rather than just a bit of spit and polish with some new CGI effects (yes ET, I'm looking at you).  However this increased material also brings with it the problems that not all the material compliments the film in terms of total quality.None of the added scenes or sequential movements are bad or even average, they are all interesting, but some just don't seem to really fit.  The plantation scene has some great dialogue (that strikes a real chord so recently post-Iraq) and it makes it's points but it just didn't seem to fit. I can see what Coppola was trying to do and, if you watch Hearts Of Darkness, you can see that it frustrates him that it doesn't work, but he got it right first time, it doesn't fit despite it's standalone merits. Likewise the playboy bunny scene intrigued me as I tried to get more from the bunny's semi-speech about being made to do things and the theme of objectification, but again it didn't totally work and seemed out of place.Despite these two major scenes not totally fitting, they are still interesting and, if you came for the journey, then that is what matters and they present themselves as a flawed part of that journey - but a part of that journey nonetheless.  Some of the smaller additions actually contribute a lot more to the film.  Little moments in the boat show Willard to be more relaxed as a man than the original did - and this greatly benefits my understanding and appreciation of his character.  How he interacts with the rest of the crew is also improved.  Other minor additions to existing scenes serve to enhance them, but improvement in some areas is difficult when it comes to this film.I won't go into details on cast, performances and the themes of the film as I have already done that in my other review.  Suffice to say that, if you loved Apocalypse Now then Redux will likely both enhance your enjoyment and slightly irritate you at the same time.  The film easily stands up to the longer running time - as another user said, I could easily give the five hour version a stab (well, maybe once!) as the journey is the all.  The additions may not be without flaw, but then that's why they were higher on the editing hierarchy than the rest of the stuff!  However they add interest and minutes to the journey - both of which are good things.Overall, it is very difficult to take `one of the best films ever madeT ' and make it better - and Coppola hasn't done that here, but he hasn't damaged it either.  It isn't a brand new film and it doesn't mess around with the original so much that it could be called a different film - so I won't compare the two as to which is `better'.  Suffice to say that, while I don't totally agree that you `can't have too much of a good thing', certainly an extra 49 minutes is gratefully received where it doesn't damage or cheapen but only seeks to enhance and support."
"After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness,' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words, ""The horror the horror"" In the film, Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia, and eliminate, with ""extreme prejudice,"" a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities On his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces, high on dope or drunk with power Although, as a result of cuts forced on Coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound ""Apocalypse Now"" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored As a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is"
"Now, it would appear by judging the user and critic reviews that my opinion is in the minority. Nonetheless, I cannot for the life of me understand the extremely high ratings for this film. The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Good Morning Vietnam all much more enjoyable. The cinematography of Apocalypse Now is very good at times, the opening scene being arguably my favourite part of the film as the music is perfect. However throughout the whole film I just felt an extreme lack of consistency with the storyline, too much confusion and jolting between themes. Whilst some of the action scenes were brilliant, I just felt a real lack of connection to the purpose. Now I won't spoil the ending but let's just say I really could not make heads or tail of the decisions made, all logic was out of the window. I am never usually critical of a film and this must be the highest rated picture that I really do not get on well with, for some reason I just expected a lot more and was very disappointed."
"So just how insane is 'Apocalypse Now'?  Well, let's say that it is the kind of film that makes you want to bang your head against the wall.  The beginning has no credits or titles; nothing.  The whole film seems like it's taking place on a different world, and as the story moves on, sanity itself is shed.  There was a French plantation scene that got cut out, and an alternate ending that would have had a massive battle scene outside Kurtz's compound.'Apocalypse Now' is not a realistic film in the sense that the presentation of the Vietnam War is far from correct: helicopters going in BEFORE the napalm strikes, a USO show in the jungle at night, and the final bridge all lit-up like a Christmas tree.  (for more realistic 'Nam War movies, try 'The Deer Hunter' or 'Platoon')But what 'Apocalypse Now' lacks in historical accuracy, it makes up in artistic and dramatic scripting.  Some of the best photography and lighting ever can be found here.The film also raises some severe philosophical issues, and gives us entirely new ones.  When the movie begins, the war is raging around us.  It is chaotic and nerve-racking, yet still rational.  When we finally get to Kurtz's base, the action has died down, but rational thinking has long since been vanquished to the point of total lunacy.  This shows us the truth about men of war in times of war and peace.  The voyage down the river has a sense of time travel (a sense that would have been much more apparent had the French Plantation scene remained.)  And when you get to the end, keep in mind the old phrase: The King is dead...  Long live the king.Is Kurtz insane?  Or are we not yet ready to understand him?  These questions and more are up to you as 'Apocalypse Now has no easy answers."
"Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words, hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance of the film. The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity. This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism.Enjoy."
"There must be something inherent in man, something from long ago, that sits deep within us; a scary thing, frightening to those who would choose - or who are forced to - gaze at it.In making this movie, Coppola must have seen this thing that is not always visible. And if he did not see it in its entirety then in what must surely be a cliché by now, he saw enough of it to allow the heart of its darkness to pulse throughout this film.And just as Coppola was changed by his experience in the jungle, so too his most mysterious character. Something happened to Colonel Kurtz. Something he saw fractured his mind, the diamond bullet shattering his perceptions into a single struggle that he himself, deep within his heart, knew he was unable to comes to terms with. And this is the crux of this movie, that this journey into darkness can promise a truth so clear that it blinds you, a truth so powerful that is keeps a hold of you and does not let you go and traps you into staying exactly, exactly where you are.For the critics of this film, I wonder if they would ever admit to the existence of the dark place within. Admitting it, will they discover empathy? Art - and the film maker's craft is certainly that - surely requires the observer to join forces with the artist so as to see and to experience the world from the perspective of whatever the artist has discovered. Coppola, following the path of his own film making, ensures that his central character Captain Willard, journeying deep into the jungle, deep into his heart, has his own chance to discover the horrific artistry of the Colonel."
"Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.What, exactly, does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt. When Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, `The horror.the horror.' is the realization of Willard's corruptness. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. This isn't a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases a character gains something, whether it be emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. But Willard both gains and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And that is a shocking ending.`Apocalypse Now' is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking. This film is wholly different from `The Godfather.' It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and, by the end, original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within us.At first it does appear to be another war film. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.Willard carries out his mission `with extreme prejudice,' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers, including the boat captain, Chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forest), and a very young `Larry' Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in `The Matrix').""Apocalypse Now"" is in a many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. As our main character, Willard, carries on his journey, he meets an array of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper), whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in ""The Million Dollar Hotel,"" one of the worst films I have ever seen. Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does. He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages. In this case, he is translating Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard.Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. ""Apocalypse Now"" has many. Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history. There is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says, `I love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory,' we all crack a smile.I won't lie to you: `Apocalypse Now' is a strange film. It isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze. The end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches. But what it all comes down to, what really matters, is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. The horror is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, `You have a right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me.' Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. To many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head. But that isn't what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz has realized just how great he had it, and how bad some others had it. By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones, living our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit. By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something. Just how easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It is two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men. And after Willard murders Kurtz, and hears Kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of war. To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it has done to him. The horror.5/5 stars -"
"Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far ""up the river"".Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's."
"From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Like the movie he was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now."
"""Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable plugged straight into Kurtz"" that piece of dialogue from Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, sets the psychedelic tone for what is widely considered Francis Ford Coppola's most ambitious project. Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's novela Heart of Darkness, 'Apocalypse Now' tells the tale of decorated soldier Walter E Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, and the frightening journey of his assassin Captain Willard. Kurtz, who has abandoned his military obligation, has recruited an army of tribal locals deep in the heart of a war ravaged Cambodian jungle. He has in every sense of the word, gone insane. Just like Willard, we know very little of his enemy Colonel Kurtz, and as he descends further towards the Colonels compound, the more he learns about him, and most importantly, himself. As the two men collide, Kurtz's rants and confessions portray a ghost of somebody lost in time and space, reeling with pain and profound hurt, as we hear tales of a renegades life that put Willard's assumed past into some sort of moral perspective. Does Willard have the guts and instinct to carry out the responsibility placed upon him? One of the reason's why 'Apocalypse now' has a lasting legacy over other Vietnam war films is not only due to its cast, but it's director Francis Ford Coppola and his desire and will to defy modern convention and deliver one of motion pictures most analyzed and lorded movies from a near flawless and revolutionary period of cinema. To say Coppola had reached the peak of his creative and artistic powers would be a mere under statement, and to acknowledge the depth and underlying detail he has outlined can not only illustrate the brilliance of his film making psyche, but position the audience in the same chaotic realm as its cast and crew. We see the fanatic struggle of Captain Willard and we see the madness of Colonel Kurtz. The other essential character is the jungle itself, just like an actor, it transforms and evolves many times through out the movie. We first see it as a harmless estuary slowly bend into a tunnel toward hell. We also see a far more primitive tug of war between Willard and the jungle, a war that can only be won and lost in his own mind. 'Apocalypse now' is not a horror movie, but it is so much more frightening. The mark of a great film is it's power to defy categorization, and Coppola's 1979 masterpiece does just that."
"Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth.Saving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but its message is dull and while its very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, starting from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither, the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he isn't, nobody holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.Both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues, but while Copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war, the Iraq war, the second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other one ..."
"The picture talks about the captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who tells the story , he is assigned for a special mission : Kill Kurtz (Marlon Brando) , American general highly decorated who the army officers (Harrison Ford , G.D. Spradlin) believe has gone murderer and nut . Willard joins to misfit crew (Albert Hall , Sam Bottons , Frederic Forest, Larry Fishburne) make a risked and dangerous journey up river towards Cambodia . They'll find a mad marine captain (Robert Duval) fond of surf , playboy bunnies and French military and a civil group (Christian Marquand and Aurore Clement) living lonely on a plantation since Dien Bien Phu defeat (1954) . The travel is dangerously developed until the fateful meeting with Kurtz .Its a stunning and absorbing story that is based on Joseph Conrad novel : ¨the heart of the darkness¨ . The travel is narrated as a surrealist odyssey leading to the dreadful and horrible final but when the protagonists find General Kurtz the scenarios are darkest and gloomiest . Martin Sheen had a heart attack during the filming and some shots of Willard's back are of doubles , including Sheen's brother Joe Estevez who was flown out specially . The storyline by John Milius tackles issues of ethics and morality and the horror war . In 2001 was realized a ¨redux¨ , a new reediting adding footage , the episode of the playmates and the French people encounters , where there are a lot of nudism and is a bit boring but is pretty dialog and little action . This new edition is today considered to be the official version . Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks , ended up taking 16 months . The movie in spite of the passed time is still powerful and astounding . Colorful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is spellbound and breathtaking , he won an Oscar , a very well deserved Academy Award . Carmine Coppola musical score and time songs are atmospheric and exceptional . The picture was perfectly directed by Francis Ford Coppola , pacing with great sensitivity and artistic ambition . Rating: Above average . Awesome."
"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. It's one of the best narrations, if not THE best, I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten, such as......Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes.That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No, there are a few very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is a little too goofy at times. Then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words.So, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!"
"I saw this film once per decade in my first thirty years on Earth, and I've decided I don't need or want to see it again. It's a good film, and interesting from start to finish, but for me its I first saw this movie as a kid, and I was impressed (if rather confused). I had no idea it was supposed to be the best film ever, so it never occurred to me that anyone might think that.Next time I saw the film I was in my teens, and I'd read Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness - thus, I was less impressed. By this point I was a little more into movies, so I'd seen more critically acclaimed classics too - another contributing factor to the film's diminishment in my eyes.The last time I saw it was in my mid-to-late twenties, and I was honestly disappointed. When I next had the chance to watch the movie, a year or so ago, I passed.Fans of Coppola and lovers of this movie will be ready by now to condemn me as a moron or philistine, but I truly believe this to be an overrated Hollywood mess.It fails as an adaptation because of all the extraneous business: it's no longer about a man's journey to find Kurtz, it's about a seething mass of American national obsessions over Vietnam, war, race and imperialism.Also, unlike Conrad's spare, to-the-point writings, the film deals almost exclusively in hyperbole. There are quiet moments, but they ring false in amidst the craziness.As other reviews have pointed out, it's not really a war movie. However, its hard to see it as such since every scene is more or less obsessing over Vietnam.Other reviews have also pointed out that it's not meant to be realistic, but I question that perception. It looks to me as if it *is* intended to be realistic in many ways - and the fact that it isn't is another of the film's failings in my eyes.The racism of the film is also uncomfortable to me. Where Conrad's novel embodied the racism of its era (in which a white European did indeed have trouble viewing black Africans as human), this comparatively recent film embodies modern American racism by treating its nonwhite extras like so many cattle (no reference intended).None of them have personalities or recognisable aims and objectives - they're seen only as faceless savages, as dangerous enemies, a mindless force which can be harnesses either by clever Communists or manipulative madmen.The key performances are more interesting than actually good. Sheen isn't outstanding, certainly not at his best, and Fishburne is way underused. The big disappointment, however, is Marlon Brando. After such a long journey, so many death and traumas, its awful to realise that their objective is this old tubby loon who waddles around mumbling and being worshipped by unconvincing ""savages"".I've never been a fan of Brando, who for me is like an older, fatter Al Pacino. He knows no restraint, and while many film lovers rate him all his performances seem pretty much the same to me... in that these are actors whose personalities get in the way of their acting. They always seem like themselves, whether its appropriate or not.It's probably fair to point out that I'm not a Coppola fan, either. The phrase I used as a header here was originally something I said about The Godfather. Coppola's movies always come across bombastic and self-important, self-consciously ""big"" movies with heavy themes.I do understand the film, and I appreciate that it has many moments of inspired cinematography and several truly amazing scenes. But for me, it never connects emotionally.Too many characters and situations ring false. The structure is too messy, the use of pop music grates on my nerves, the plot-holes are increasingly apparent with every viewing, and to top it off I find the idea that this is adaptation of Conrad rather absurd. In many ways it's less true to the source than West Side Story is to Romeo and Juliet.It's not a bad film, as such, but a deeply flawed film... and, from a personal point of view, sententious and unnecessary."
"First off, I am not reviewing the classic original which I would give 10 stars to, I am reviewing the horrible 2001 redux, and this is why there is 1 star.I don't care what Coppola says. He calls the REDUX/redo/re-edit that he put in theaters in 2001 the ""definitive version"" of Apocolypes Now. He's crazy. He hasn't made a decent film in a long, long time. He took a great and classic film and ruined it, and it's his own. Will he do this to the first two Godfather films? Robert Duvall's gung-ho character has turned into a buffoon, searching for a surfboard that Martin Sheen has stolen. Martin Sheen's character has turned into a warm-hearted guy who loves his crew, plays games with them like stealing surfboards, as opposed to a serious guy who has a very serious mission like in the original. Marlon Brando reads TIME magazine. And there is a scene with a French Plantation that destroys the entire flow to the movie, and plays like a corny dream sequence and is just horrible, with acting so bad it's more of a nightmare. The worst scene in the redux is when Chef and Lance (Fred Forrest and Sam Bottoms) party in a ""parked"" helicopter with some of the Playboy Playmates from the previous R&R scene. One of the playmates has a birdcage on her head, no joke. This is another scene that kills the entire flow of the movie, and makes Martin Sheen a nice guy, since he is the one who sets up his men with the girls in the first place. And also, Coppola takes the scene where Lance is water skiing (with the Stones ""Satisfaction"" playing) and moves it from the beginning of the film to the middle. This was, in the original, one of the best setup scenes of all time, letting you unwind and to get to know the laid-back situation of these men, and Coppola ruins it. Oh the horror, the horror, the horror of this redux. The Redux is a total travesty. Coppola has ruined his own masterpiece. Imagine Van Gogh, if he'd lived, taking ""Starry Night"" and adding to it, or DiVinci or Monet or anyone else. Coppola has lost it, completely. And so, the true ""horror"" isn't the Vietnam war, but the hands of a burnt-out has-been filmmaker mangling one of his best works. And by the way, here I am reviewing the redux only, which is why there is only one star."
"Martin Sheen's performance is one of the greatest things to ever be done! The sound throughout is ambient glossy perfection, I love how the acting is incredible in every scene. Apocalypse Now is a truly magical adventure thrill ride filled with beautiful atmospheric vibe. There's so much exciting elements even for a non war fan this is masterful for anyone."
"To the people who gave 1/10, let me try and explain why this movie is widely described with superlatives such as seminal and masterpiece.Like the Stone's Exile on Main St, this film is layered. I've been listening to Exile for 30 years and its layering allows me to listen to different perspectives which stop the record from getting boring. Apocalypse has a similar quality. I first watched it maybe when I was about 18 (late 80s). At the time I didn't get it. I thought it was okay, albeit a bit overrated and perhaps past it's time. In my late 20s I found myself trawling a video library for something to watch. I'd pretty much seen everything so gave Apocalypse another go. The difference that time around was I thought about the movie for days after I had watched it. I watched the movie for the 4th time two days ago (40th anniversary edition). It just gets better every time you watch it. That is rare in a movie. Two days later, I'm not only thinking about it but writing about it.To those who say this movie is not about the Vietnam War, I disagree. There are two main themes, along with other tributary themes, in this movie. The first is about the horrors of war (everything from death, dehumanisation, killing of innocents, madness etc) which I needn't go into as it's well documented here. The other main theme is the shambles that was the Vietnam War. Incompetence, disunity and malfunction.The Nung River journey serves it's purpose two-fold - a journey through dehumanisation that ends in madness, and an excuse to show off various examples of malfunction. Every encounter shows and example of why the US lost the war. Kilgore was acting out of self-interest. There was rorting going on left, right and centre. The bridge at the border had no command. In the words of other war movies, the Vietnam War was a cluster****. Perhaps the biggest example of this was in the letters from Kurtz. He found a way to fight the war successfully and was punished for it by his incompetent superiors. This in itself is it's own minor theme. Kurtz went mad not so much because of the physical horrors of war but because he shafted for being competent.To the people who give the Redux (and therefore the 40th Anniversary edition I saw a few nights back) a 1/10. You have strong points. For me, the plantation scene stopped the flow. I can't see a reason to include this scene other than for Coppola to voice his own opinions of Vietnam through the French character. This further suggests that the disaster of the Vietnam War is indeed one of the main themes. There were other bits that others have pointed out as being unnecessary - the theft of the surfboard and subsequent pursuit of it by Kilgore. Added nothing and took away from the movie.As for criticisms of Sheen's acting. I thought the whole blank face fit the character. I have no idea how good an actor he is or isn't but for me Willard had thoughts about what was going on but kept them to himself. Initially I think his facial expressions showed he was shocked at the gross incompetence going on around him but chose to keep it to himself.I've seen this movie four times. The original twice, redux once and 40th anniversary once. I'm going to watch the original again. For anyone who hasn't seen it, my best guess is the original is the best one."
"This is one of my favourite films. Long but you barely notice how much time has passed since the story is so easy to fall into. It's an almost dreamlike film, dealing with the Vietnam war. The opening scene itself is enough to draw you in, with the soundtrack by The Doors and the juxtaposition between the rising helicopters the steady turning of the blades of a fan in a hotel room. The colours really highlight moods and themes. Great film, I could go on all day about it."
"As I stated above, I think that the 2000 version of the film ought to be treated separately. The Redux is not just a longer version. It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the ""french"" episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it ""the most philosophical of all movies"" - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What I'm saying is that it's one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. I've seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended."
"* Just to get it out of the way: I viewed the Redux version of this film, and that MAY be the cause of some of my negative statements. I cannot say for certain either way.If you've ever been a member of a message board and you've read the thread about the last movie you watched, you'll know that 99% of the replies have one word or less beside the official score. For a long time, I wondered how that could be. I used to think, ""Don't these people have any more of an opinion other than 'good' or 'bad' or 'average'? They just wasted their lives watching a movie; couldn't they say more than just a score?"" It took me a few months to figure the entire situation out, but when I did, it made perfect sense. Most movieseven good moviesare so predictable and unoriginaleven if they're enjoyablepeople still lack any real, definitive feelings about them. They see a movie on a Friday night and by Saturday night they forgot they even watched it. As a writer myself, I know first-hand there is nothing worse than an indifferent audience, but it seems that sums up most of the American population. Why? Because of films like Apocalypse Now.Apocalypse Now opens up with a semi-interesting beginning. It misleads the viewer into thinking that it actually has some physiological depth, then completely drops all depth into the gutter by the 10-minute mark and never picks it up again. Despite what you were lead to believe, there is no plot here. Or let me rephrase that: there is a plot, but it drops it after the 20-minute mark and never picks it up again until the final 30 minutes. Everything between those two points is exactly what you expect for a clichéd war drama . . .Talking. It almost amuses me that an ""epic"" movie can have the flattest characters in cinema history, but the screenwriters always have them talk and talk as if they're actually interesting to listen to. In Apocalypse Now's case, the characters are ALL walking stereotypical war clichés with legs andunfortunately tongues. They're all simply nothing but dumb animals created to carry the pointless dialogue out. They talk so much it's downright nauseating. What are they talking about? I forgot, and I just finished the film 10 minutes ago. Their dialogue is all predictable copy/paste war dialogue; I do remember that much. Naked girls, guns, cliché monologues about life/deathall the stuff you've heard thousands of times. I was never a soldier in the Vietnam War, but I can pretty much assure you the real soldiers talked about more than these unimaginative movies give them credit for.Besides talking, what do you get in Apocalypse Now? Well, there are only two main action scenes in the entire movie, so you can cross balls-to-the-wall war action off your list of expectations. No, this nearly 4-hour long film focuses on shots of boats going down the river with soldiers talking, and not much else. There is no emotional experience here. There is no ""horror"", as the tagline proclaims. The most ""horror"" you get is a bunch of PG-rated war scenes and some eerie music as the soldiers move through fog. If the director had focused on the true horror of realistic war, I wouldn't have to be sarcastic when I say: How terrifying! Instead, however, the director focuses things we've seen before. Hundreds of times. He focuses on the copy/paste Hollywood-style war, not the truly gritty, dirty war. He doesn't rub your nose in the true horror of war; he pats you on the back and gives you generic conversation scenes.My point here: Apocalypse Now is one of the most boring movies even filmed. It's also safe and predictable, adding nothing whatsoever to the overdone war genre. It doesn't leave you thinking, ""My God, this is terrible!"" It leaves you thinking, ""My God, I could have done the laundry with that wasted time . . ."" And that's all. That's all there is to say about this nearly 4-hour long movie. The entire synopsis of every major event from open to close could literally be told in two sentences of text. Sometimes you have to sit back and realize that most award-winning, critically acclaimed, ""classic"" films are nothing but hollow shells. They boast great acting and cinematography, but they have no story. No soul. No moral. No thrill. No point . . .This is why I blame films like Apocalypse Now for the indifference people have toward movies. These films are supposedly the best of the best, but at the same time they're completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't try their hardest to find pleasure in boredom in hopes of becoming an all-powerful FILM BUFF on some cheesy website. There is nothing wrong with being intellectual. There is something wrong with being pretentious and internally forcing yourself to love a film just because the critics do. And those are the only people who could give Apocalypse Now a perfect score. Or even a mildly positive score.0/10"
"IMDB needs seperate listings for the 1979 classic and the 2001 director's cut. The former is a classic while the latter is a bomb.
I don't recall ever seeing a film where the director's cut was so inferior to the original. The extra footage adds NOTHING to the film but does make the movie seem both endless and meaningless. Sometimes less is more (ie, the 1979 theatrical release). It's unfortunate that the DVD doesn't allow the viewer to select which version to watch."
"Reading many of the comments here, I am stunned that I found none who actually got it. This is a film about the study of humanity and what it means to be human. Kurtz is not mad because of the war...he is mad because of what he must do to win against barbarians...he had to sacrifice his humanity and he did it willingly. He teaches us that in order for civilzied human beings to survive an onslaught of barbarians, you have to immerse yourself...defeat your own humanity. And then, when you have defeated the barbarian, you look around...and you are not human any more. In essence, the barbarian wins by forcing this sacrifice on civilized warriors. I left the theater in amazement that such a topic was even thought of for cinematic art. I got it just about everyone else missed it. And I felt contempt for those around me in the leaving crowd who were complaining they were disappointed in the film. They completely missed the point. Now, civilized people are faced again with a decision against barbarians who saw peoples heads off on TV. Will we immerse ourselves and our humanity to do what we must to survive...or will we surrender to the alternative if we don't? Is a surrender to barbarians as bad as becoming one of them? I think everyone should review ""Apocalypse Now"" once again because we are about to find out."
"It's a pity to see a director put so much time and effort into a film and come back with something so awful.  This film is pretentious, chaotic, self-indulgent and ridiculously overrated.  The first half has its moments, even though Robert Duvall's character is a cartoon, but once Dennis Hopper and Marlon Brando show up and start chewing the scenery as if it's all you can eat at the diner and they've been on a three-day fast, the movie dies. The last twenty minutes or so look as if they were filmed by a three-year-old playing with his father's movie camera.  I'm sorry to be so harsh, but this was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had watching a film."
"Well, after watching Full Metal Jacket and seeing the high rating here on a movie on a similar topic, i decided to sit through AN: Redux. What a mistake i had made.I really expected to get my socks blown off with its rating here on IMDb, it even got to the point where I was making things out to be better than they really were...thinking- the people on IMDb must know what they are talking about! By the end of the movie seeing Sheen's blank expression for the billionith time...ugh! How can you guys say this guy nailed the role perfectly and compliment his acting, he doesn't have much to nail or act! There are other comments here which i disagree with. Such as, the opinions of time-less lines ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" Zomg! Classic! ""The horror...the horror"". Wow! The last parts bordering on Art? What the hell? Um. No. Bad movie guys. I really do want my time back on this one. How some users can call this the best movie of all time is beyond me. Each to their own i guess."
"After seeing the high rating I decided to take a look at this film, for the first hour and forty minutes I was bored to tears. After that point it looked like there might have been some slight hope things were going to pick up, but that was only for ten minutes then it went back to the boring drab and dullness until the end of the film.There's not a lot I can say as hardly anything interesting or worth watching is in this film, just seemed like the same thing happening over and over again just with different camera angles until they finally got to the island. Even then it doesn't live up to the expectations of what the characters in the film have been trying to imply all along.There was nothing insane about this film or the guy on the island, there was maybe a few minutes of very mild gore, nothing scary, no horror and no craziness.. just dull dull dull.I would find the beeping noise of a reversing truck more exciting than this film."
"This movie was just plain bad. I have never reviewed a movie here in my four years of browsing the site, but never in my days of watching movies have I been so infuriated by a film. For starters, the movie just doesn't make any sense. There is no logical transition from scene to scene. As I was watching this movie, I found myself actually TRYING to convince myself that it was good, that at some point during this overdone, self-righteous piece of poo, that some semblance of a theme or motif would come into play. No: The movie continues to lead you down the linear path of the story. I now see where Charlie Sheen inheritted his blank stare acting prowess from that he so consistently displays on a weekly basis in his new sitcom. Well, I guess it is the apocalypse NOW because I've read that Two and a Half Men is the top viewed sitcom on network television. And guess what, this is the 36th ranked FREAKING movie on IMDb. I never thought that a single movie could cause me to never want to watch another movie of the same GENRE. THATS how bad this movie was. 3 hours and 20 minutes of my life, wasted So I thought that, although I normally don't review movies here, why not put in another 2 minutes so maybe, just MAYBE, I could have done some good by watching this movie. That good will be if I can manage to convince even one potential viewer to avoid this overdone pretentious Francis Ford Coppola bullshit. So as far as I'm concerned, IMDb and every movie critic out there has lost all credibility."
"This movie was filled with melodramatic acting, bad humor, horrible character development, no action, sub-par editing, awful music, and oh yes the Redux version is over 3 hrs long! I loathe this film, and will never understand its appeal. Come to think of it I'll never understand the appeal for the Godfather either. Give me Goodfellas any day. I think Francis Coppola is the most over rated Writer/Director of all time. Give me Robert Zemickis or Steven Spielberg and I'll be a happy little boy. Whatever ""it"" is that people see in his movies I will never understand. You know what I think... It was the 70's and everyone was on drugs. That must be the reason why everything was so weird. I know people are gonna respond to this and say ""You just didn't get it."" I got it. I got the whole stupid movie. And I thought it stunk."
"During the Vietnam era, you were either a ""square"" or ""hip"" -- with ""hip"" meaning pro-communist, anti-capitalist, pro-sexual-revolution, anti-mainstream American values. Hollywood directors generally chose to be ""hip."" The significance of this fact should become apparent in due course. Now, a little boring history for those who can stomach it: U.S. troops were present in large numbers in South Vietnam from roughly 1962 to 1972. U.S. troops came home in '72, having successfully strengthened the South Vietnamese army (ARVN) so that it could defend South Vietnam from invasion by the North Vietnamese communists and from subversion by the South Vietnamese communist Viet Cong. The ARVN did, in fact, successfully defend South Vietnam for almost three years. Then, a Democrat-controlled Congress cut off funding to the South Vietnamese in the wake of Republican President Nixon's resignation over the Watergate scandal. The North Vietnamese invaded, and South Vietnam fell. Soon thereafter, the Communist Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and tortured and murdered some two million innocent men, women and children. This is the true tragedy of the Vietnam war -- something that no Hollywood director to my knowledge has touched (""The Killing Fields"" is not accompanied by a political explanation of the Cambodian Holocaust.)Four years after the fall of South Vietnam, and seven years after U.S. troops left the country, Francis Ford Coppola made ""Apocalypse Now."" He was one of a slew of Hollywood directors who sought to capitalize on the deep well of anti-war sentiment in the United States. Well, let's examine such anti-war sentiment for a minute. Being anti-war is fine, but those who are against war are called upon to offer alternatives that work -- and they never do. Instead, they hold up the UN as some sort of ideal -- a UN made up mostly of undemocratic countries with no respect for human rights.In the end, the Vietnam War was but one of a series of proxy wars between the communist Soviet Union (at times allied with communist China) and the capitalist West. The Korean War was the first major battle in this rivalry, where both sides sought to extend their influence while bleeding and demoralizing the other side. These proxy wars were a substitute for all-out nuclear war. Terrible things were done by both sides in this conflict, but I believe that the U.S. cause was a noble one. And it largely succeeded, in that the Soviet Union collapsed and freedom and prosperity expanded into Eastern Europe. But the conduct of the Vietnam War by U.S. politicians was terrible at best. U.S. soldiers never lost a battle in Vietnam. But politicians in Washington would not allow them to keep the territory they had won. They refused to follow Barry Goldwater's advice, which was to ""Win, or get the hell out!"" They failed to mine Haiphong Harbor in North Vietnam to keep Soviet and communist Chinese supplies out of that country. They refused to invade Laos and Cambodia in order to close down the weapons supply line that ran along the Ho Chi Minh trail, ending only thirty miles from Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital.In the meantime, Vietnam was the first televised war, and the U.S. media were largely left-wing (as they are today) and anti-war. During the Tet Offensive (a major defeat for the communists, and a major victory for the Americans), Walter Cronkite declared that America had ""failed"" in Vietnam. This was just one of many distortions by the media. The American public stopped supporting the war. And some celebrities -- like Jane Fonda -- actually rooted for victory by the communists. What, then, do we see in ""Apocalypse Now""? Nothing more than all the one-sidedly anti-American, anti-Vietnam-war stereotypes of the day: playing Wagner (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); showing a giggling soldier-moron in a helicopter randomly machine gunning innocent Vietnamese peasants (subtle; I don't suppose that could be a suggestion that the Americans were the equivalent of Nazis?); and so on and so forth. Of course, Coppola wasn't satisfied addressing such ""substantive"" issues. His movie had to be a ""grand vision"" -- not unlike his ""The Godfather."" So he threw everything except the kitchen sink into this movie: the pretentious linkage he tried to make between his magnum opus and Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"" -- ""Wow, man! That's heavy! Copolla is our Conrad!""; the psychedelic/surreal affectations (a first!); the ""ironic"" and ""clever"" juxtapositions (a battle mixed up with surfing); the ""revelation"" of ""Ugly American"" insensitivity; and so on. Well, Copolla was preaching to the choir with this movie, and in this he was a great success. But there is no significance to this movie otherwise. If you really want to see enlightening scenes from Vietnam, rent the multi-disc documentary on the war (I forget the title; there are several.) One very moving scene shows U.S. soldiers singing ""Silent Night"" on the flare-lit battle-field on Christmas eve. Watching a documentary on the war might actually teach you something about that war -- a first! Otherwise, you're going to have to settle for Hollywood's version from the likes of Oliver Stone and Coppola. The true subject of Coppola's movie, in my opinion, is Coppola's giant ego. The main secondary subject is the dumbing down of an American public that would uncritically eat up his ""vision""; the exact same thing is true of Oliver Stone's various movies. Hollywood thinks that ""Epatez les bourgeois!"" is the last word in creativity, even when its arrows fall far short of the target. That is the reason why most ""serious"" Hollywood movies, in my opinion, are overblown failures. And Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" surely stands at the very front of the line of those failures."
"Disturbingly insane and boring, as it came highly rated, I forced myself to watch it till the end and ended up feeling I wasted 2.5 Hours of my life. Cinematography and lighting may be top notch only if you have the stomach to watch it till the end. there are better movies on war and violence if that's what you like."
"I don't rate a movie as a 10 but this is the closest I've come to doing that.As someone who has watched the original, the redux and the 6 hour workprint versions, I can tell you this is the most perfect version of this classic.
Firstly with Dolby atmos and 4K,it looks and sounds spectacular on IMAX save for the first 10 minutes for technical reasons,I'm told.
This version is shorter than the redux but longer than the original at 183 minutes. But importantly, this is the most cohesive and watcher-friendly version.It is not just that some scenes were added but importantly a lot of small changes made to a lot of scenes which makes the narrative smoother and a very pleasing descent into the madness towards the end.
This version makes the entire role of Bob Duvall so so clear and perfect;Brando is given exactly the right amount of scenes and the unnecessary scene with the playboy playmates included in the redux is axed which is perfect for the movie.The french plantation scene is included but edited and added to make it so much more coherent with the story. Some scenes at the last bridge on the river are also edited to show the madness but not drag the movie down.
I cannot recommend more to buy this version for fans of this classic.This for me is a must-buy!"
"Spoilers herein.Much has been made of the personal risks taken by this filmmaker and crew, and the mapping to the metaphor of war:Coppola, already rich and famous for the lush but pointless `Godfather' films, reaches into his soul and decides to risk it to do something important. He deliberately chooses Conrad's metaphor of personal journey, and creates a multi-layered structure: the sense of Man in society; the `reason' of War, colonial wars and the specifics of Vietnam; the meeting of darkness of self at the end of the hero's journey; and at the lowest layer, Coppola's own quest for import as an artist.When I saw this over a couple decades back, I thought it a failure: earnestness does not equal art; commitment does not deliver skill; Italian passion outraces German nihilism.But now, with the `restored' footage, I have a completely different take. I still think it a failure overall, but with some powerful images. As with the Doors, its aspirations were too large for the ability, the vision too grand for the reach. But now with the passage of time, the metaphor has had a polar switch.Twenty years ago, the War was a simple affair: confusing at the bristles, jaded selfishness at the handle. With the passage of time as we learn more, the War has `become' incredibly more complex and unfathomable. Now with the film: it started life as huge, unfocused mess. Over a long period, with radical paring and the addition of a very competent framework of sound, something resulted. Unfocused still, but powerful enough to engage. Over time and repeated viewings, this work has been overgrown by personal probings, and integrated into the imaginative landscape like an incompetent building becoming a fond element of the cityscape. So as the war becomes less pegged in our minds, this film becomes more comprehensible, more whole.With repeated personal handling, this film has become `true.' Think of this: it now has such a clear center that the filmmaker can `enhance' that message. It is now so coherent, it begs for addition. And the three main additions are so, so very apt and self-referential:-- The French plantation takes its reason to be from the mere fact that it has been. That is precisely what this film has become: a colonizer of our minds that now makes its own sense to be there.-- The playmates. Sex -- even exploitative sex -- domesticates.
-- The extra exposure of Brando. Here was a tiger, a man whose presence tore through our minds, who changed the world, who mesmerized. He went down his own personal river before this film and was defeated. Here he shows up in a character who is precisely the actor (with a wildeyed acolyte Hopper similarly spanning fiction and reality). Wasn't clear when the film was new, but is now. These are not the winners we see, but the losers. The horror.To prepare for this redux, I watched the three `Wallace and Gromit' films. Here also was a personal vision, explored at first with extreme commitment, at high cost in the face of detractors. Working by himself for 7 years produced the first film. It was shockingly weird. The second (and probably the best) was a low-budget collaboration with one other monk. As with `Apocalypse,' this film invented itself, by charm insinuated itself into the familiar as if God had put it there all along. Then by the third film, with scores of people, the magic is transformed to cultural momentum.But there is hope: `Apocalypse' hangs on the War, and though that metaphoric connection is severed, it still stays on the shelf we first placed it: as a war movie. And there are other war movies. And since films are seldom about reality and instead about other films, we can rely on others to give us distance from this foreign invader. Two very much more skilled filmmakers in particular: Kubrick and Malick. Rely on them."
"I have just finished reading an interview with Vittorio Storaro, cinematographer for Apocalypse Now, and I am in a state of shock. Apparently, the plan, when preparing Apocalypse Now Redux, was to keep the original negative intact, and to edit the new material into a freshly struck inter positive. Unfortunately, the negative, 25 years old, was starting to fade, and Storaro was concerned that new prints would not be up to his, or the audience's, high standards. He suggested to Coppola that they re-edit directly into the original negative. This, of course, would eliminate the need for an inter positive, and allow for beautiful new prints to be struck. On the other hand, the original negative in its ""classic"" incarnation would be gone forever. Storaro asked Coppola, ""Let me know one single thing, in the future, in 10, 20, 50, 100 years from now, which version would you want the audience to see?"" And he said, ""This one.""I remember asking myself why the additional footage couldn't have been relegated to the ""Extras"" section of a DVD. My guess had been that the entire affair was a cynical attempt stir up interest in a theatrical re-release in order to make a few more bucks for the perennially cash- hungry Coppola. Would that he had been so cynical. Now we will never have the chance to see a beautiful new Technicolor dye transfer print of the original Apocalypse, a genuine classic, because Coppola actually thinks that the god-awful Redux, a bloated, ponderous, amateurish mess, is the version for which he should be remembered.I have seen the original Apocalypse dozens of times, and each time it has felt fresh, vital, visionary. I almost walked out of the theater during Redux. Like mold, the new footage had corrupted the old, making the whole film dank and dreary. Most of the new footage was hasty, improvised, and pointless, and integrated badly into the whole. The performances resembled juvenile acting class exercises. The legendary French Plantation scenes were so over the top and silly that I thought an unused sequence from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life had been dropped into the film.As Paulette Goddard once said of Chaplin, ""(Coppola) sometimes thinks he thinks."" Despite his reputation as a rebellious visionary, Coppola has always done his best work for hire. When he has been allowed to go off the rails, he has produced crap fests like One From the Heart (which I actually saw in a theater) and Redux. Looks like it was only the pressure to deliver that prevented box office disaster and bankruptcy in 1979. I, like many others, have spent the last 25 years waiting for another Coppola masterpiece. From the evidence in the Storaro interview, we have all waited in vain. The man's judgment is faulty. Maybe if he can get back together with Bob Evans..."
"If there has ever been an overrated director, Francis Ford Coppola is the one. Apocalypse Now is nearly universally praised as one of the greatest war films of all time. I consider it to be one of the most overrated movies of all time; far from a masterpiece, it merely cashes in on the American anti-war sentiment of the time.Let's begin with the film's story itself, shall we? Well, although adapted from fantastic source material (Conrad's Heart of Darkness), Apocalypse Now has a very vague plot joining the film. As I have learned, the film was plagued with production problems, which may be why this is so. Either way, the film is comprised of a few interesting scenarios (I particularly liked the boat massacre) tied together in an extremely convoluted way. The story makes no sense, because it's practically irrelevant— too much side material takes away from a promising plot.I've said time and time again that Coppola has a very feeble grasp of suspense. During the duration of Apocalypse Now, what does the hero, Willard, do? He watches. What does the audience, therefore, do? We watch Willard watching. The increasing chaos downriver is not a magnificent suspense builder. To be honest, it's sheer boredom.And what of the characters? Willard is a character made out of cardboard. All he does is frown and think about his mission. I couldn't empathize with him at all, and frankly didn't care whether he was successful in his mission or not. His crew is a ragtag bunch of sketched-in, half realized, uninteresting characters. Robert Duvall's character has fantastic potential, but emerges as uninteresting: he appears, demonstrates Coppola's point that the military is a bunch of hypocrites, and disappears, all without contributing much to the plotAnother thing: a novelist's approach does not work in films. The drama should be performed, and not narrated. Although voice-over proves effective at times, Apocalypse Now is one great big, long voice-over that quickly becomes stale, boring and ineffective.Another thing: the film supposedly ""truly captures"" the insanity of war. No. What it does is ""subtly"" point out the hypocrisy of the American army. They eat meals that the guys in the field would die for. They were planning to punish Kurtz for his murder of four civilians, but praised him once the press got a hold of the story. They send Willard out to kill Kurtz because he's half insane already. There's no leadership at the bridge. The soldiers go absolutely insane over the Playboy ""playmates"" instead of concentrating on the war (that was one of the film's most disturbing scenes-- not in a good way). A man indiscriminately shoots down innocent Vietnamese peasants. Robert Duvall's character attacks a village because the beach has ""the best waves"" for surfing. Far from subtle, it points out exactly what Apocalypse Now is: a cash cow for Hollywood after the anti-war movement.And now for the good bits: After over two hours of insane boredom, Marlon Brando appears AT LAST. After two hours of watching Willard watching the ""insanity"" of the war, I was glad for a character of interest. Most of Brando's dialogue was, apparently, ad-libbed, and you can tell. His dialogue does not reek of Coppola's mediocre (or just plain bad) screen writing. That is the film's one redeeming quality: only due to Brando (whom I, ironically, consider the most overrated actor ever) is the last 20 minutes of any interest whatsoever. There is one other redeeming quality, and that is the boat massacre. Truly the film's strongest scene, it is sadly followed by a trail of disappointments that all but drown it out.The Verdict: Far from a masterpiece, Apocalypse Now is barely coherent. Coppola apparently described the film as ""not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam"". Incorrect. It is Hollywood raking in profits after Vietnam. It's no use accusing me of simply not understanding the movie's point, or of having to watch it again. (I'll live quite comfortably if I never hear of the film again.) As a matter of fact, I've seen it three times: the first in my film class, where I despised it, and had to study it and its ""messages""; the second on my own, where I appreciated it a little more, but not by much; the third prior to writing this review, where I returned to my original position. To be blunt, I don't like Apocalypse Now at all.Overall Rating: 2/10 (Brando's segment alone guarantees the 2)"

I mean WHY?Maybe in 1979 during the war it was awe inspiring etc. etc. but I failed to notice what all the commotion is about.Plot: A Soldier not having much work these days getting all bored is assigned a mission to annihilate an ex-army legend who has now taken refuge with this band of soldiers somewhere in Vietnam-Cambodia during the war.Acting is brilliant make no mistake but I couldn't connect the pieces. Maybe I'm dumb and all but unless your an American this is boring & depressing.P.S. I generally appreciate war movies.
"I was suspicious of the trailers and of critic's summaries: this was a re-scanned Re-Dux omitting a scene with the Bunnies. Wrong.Yes that scene is gone but other scenes are edited, noticeably the french plantation scene, where a line of Willard's is cut, which gives more credit to the viewer's intelligence. Another short scene where Willard is captive in a shipping container is missing.In this new version, the film is more visually cohesive and the mood gradually builds with less of the distractions of before. With a 4K rendition, shots are more obviously out of focus on rare occasion. Coppola has made a legendary film as near to cinematic perfection as one could imagine, especially considering it was shot on film, with no digital trickery to fall back on."
"Many of the added scenes explain certain parts of the older edit in a more natural and complete way.For Example in the Original the bit where for whatever reason, previously holing him aloof, the crew at least makes a formal attempt to include Willard by offering him marijuana. He, of course refuses and shuts the curtain so he can get drunk (emphasizing his SpecOps/Officer Status) Disassociating himself from the crew and perhaps alleviating an awkward situation, by not fraternizing to much with the men.It was exactly that the inclusion of Willard (by the crew) was unanticipated and unexplained that had always bugged me when I watched the original.Now in Redux the conditions above are preceded by the ""Flight of the Surfboard"". Kilgore's attitude just begs Willard to flashback to his cadet days, and ""misappropriate"" Kilgores board. (Juvenile Pranks being of the finest military traditions) In short, stealing the surfboard is not at all out of character for Willard and the scene adds a logical progression of slightly greater camaraderie leading up to the scene where he rebuffs them.Also the scene where they are all hiding under the trees with the helicopters overhead. All great stuff for male military type-bonding.The addition of the scenes gives the crew a reason to be more inclusive and more positive about Willard. They think mebbe hes not such a bad officer. But Willard remembers his position, and that the crew are expendable tools that he may have to use to accomplish his mission, and remains aloof and gets drunk alone.Best Vietnam movie of all time. Even if it has almost nothing to do with the war in specifics dealing almost exclusively with a single fictitious CovertOps mission and a few intersecting actions (both probable fiction(Kilgore) and potentially historically accurate(the Bridge)) As to the other extra scenes I found the Playboy scene's racist comments and connotations to be important enough to include. Also continues the classist regime. Chief, the middle-class black man wants a sista(Racist or Pride? Is there a difference?) Lance is lowerclass, but hes a cute white kid. Chef is lowerclass, but hes got a certain kind of charm. Clean, the lowerclass black man is shut out. Meanwhile, Willard is off in some private quarters with the third bunny as his right as officer and procurer (I think it was his deal)Best Line of the Film:the Roach ""Yeah"""
"Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?Any movie that can start out with The Doors' ""The End"" is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.    An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.  
A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made."
"In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz.  Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy.  Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad.  Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny.  However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.It is a film everyone knows, and a `making of' story that is familiar to everyone on some level.  The problems with the military, with destroyed sets right down to Keitel walking off set to be replaced by Martin Sheen who then had a near complete breakdown during filming.  However the story itself is what keeps this so popular.  The original book is set in Victorian times and is similar only in the concept of travelling up a river and confronting something dark and changed in the shape of Kurtz.  The modern day spin on it makes it even more interesting as it looks at the madness that comes with power within war.The journey itself is at times comic and at other times brutal.  The overall feeling is one of soldiers not knowing why they are fighting or who they are fighting.  The feeling of confusion and fear is inherent in the film and is very well delivered.  Willard's journey never fails to grip and is interesting on whatever level you watch it  whether it be for the famous set pieces or for the underlying themes.The performances are excellent.  Sheen has never been better and now seems so distant from his character that he is a different person.  While some of the emotion on screen was real, he does a great job as our guide through the journey.  The best performance comes from a surprising source Brando. Despite the fact that he was difficult, horribly over weight and hadn't learnt his lines, his eerie performance is still haunting.  His mumbling and reasoning in the shadows show that he may be touched by madness but, in the context of war, he is also touched by cold logical reasoning.  Likewise Dennis Hopper fits in well despite his stoned demeanour.  The support cast include some names as Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Forrest and a young Larry Fishburne.Overall this will remain a classic on many levels.  The film itself is great and full of spectacle, the story of the making itself is interesting, the performances are wonderful despite everything and the fact that it has other themes makes it even better.  As an war movie it is great simply because it isn't about the war it IS war  in the words of Coppola `it isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam, it's how the Americans were in Vietnam.  We were in the jungle, we had too much money, too much equipment and, little by little, we went insane'.  Classic film on so many levels."
"Francis Coppola's descent into madness back in the late 1970's was all about APOCALYPSE NOW, one of the most incredible pieces of art ever placed on the screen.  It is violent, beautiful, ugly, and damn dark at times.  As a war film, APOCALYPSE NOW does not move me anywhere near the way PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did.  Those two pictures deal with war in a more combative, realistic way.  You grow and bond with the troupes in those flicks.  Here, you are engulfed in complete madness, something that seems apart from actual war.  It is more of a morality play into the soul and our ""hearts of darkness"" than a war film.Do I think Coppola made a mistake trying to base a story about the Vietnam War on Joseph Conrad's fictional ""Heart of Darkness""?  Sure, and I think he feels that way too.  Vietnam and the U.S involvement in the war has nothing to do with what Coppola was trying to do.  He once said ""My film IS Vietnam,"" referring to APOCALYPSE, but is it really? Not at all.  What results is unbelievably hard to assess except to say it is sheer brilliance. It transcends the horrors of war and seemed more of a personal film with Martin Sheen representing each of us as a complex human being on an impossible mission.  It is like traveling to Hell and back, many scars obtained, many feelings drowned out.Everyone who knows a dime about movies, knows the battle itself it was to make this ambitious film.  So many images burn into memory: nepalm explosions to the tune of the Door's ""The End""; Wagner blaring from speakers placed on some U.S. helicopters about to blow up a Vietnamese village; a soldier surfing to the Stone's ""Satisfaction""; the final ritualistic slaughter we witness during the film's dreary ending.  This is all fantasy. The war is nowhere to be found in these and multiple other sequences. Vietnam is merely a backdrop to display a truly insane trip up a river where one clearly defined character (Sheen as Willard) meets a fuzzy character (Brando as Kurtz) and no real resolutions are found.  It is the trip that does it for us.Wondrously eerie sights, sounds, and experiences pulsate throughout APOCALYPSE NOW and the first three quarters of the film are perfect.  Under the conditions Coppola and crew were working under, it is no wonder they had no ending.  Brando truly ruins what Sheen, in what is probably the most underrated performance of the 70's as ""Willard"", had done to the point of arrival at Kurtz' compound.  What the hell is Brando talking about?  At least Sheen comes through at the end giving us a hint as to what the journey meant to him.This film ranks way high on my list because of the mystery of it all and the absolute audacity with which Coppola paints his descent into madness."
"Let's get one thing out of the way before we move on. Apocalypse Now is not an accurate war movie, in a sense that it does not portray the real nuts and bolts of how a war is run. But it's arguably the most groundbreaking. No other war movie has portrayed the dualities of human nature, the absurdities of war and the psychological toll it exerts on the soldiers who fight it, more boldly than Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. And none are as visually and thematically haunting. The performances by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are outstanding. The cinematography is breathtaking and the action scenes are some of the best staged and most memorable in cinema history. An audacious, evocative and gripping motion picture. Coppola is better known for the Godfather but in my opinion, this is his most important work."
"A masterwork of cinema. Heart of Darkness is one of my favourite books and a movie filmed on the same concept but on a different place and time won me over. The film raises some severe philosophical issues - but in a brutal and realistic way. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema."
"When this movie was released in 1979, the term ""post traumatic stress disorder"" was rarely used, certainly not nearly as often as it is today, to describe the emotional anxieties endured by battle-weary soldiers who had returned from the jungles of Vietnam. It seems today that APOCALYPSE,NOW!, large chunks of it anyway, illustrate the effects of this disorder on the characters,situations and most especially the atmosphere and tone of the work. Perhaps this is the reason it resonated so strongly with some viewers at the time, despite its unsatisfying concluding moments that failed to deliver the big action moment many hoped would end the film. Instead, Coppola leaves us in a heart of darkness, stuck as it were, in a state of mind from which escape seems impossible. Not only does the movie not give us an exhilarating battle scene to match the helicopter attack seen earlier, it doesn't even give its characters a rescue or deliverance, and certainly not a homecoming. Where another fil-maker might have inserted a psychologist to comment on the awful anxieties the men might be going through, Coppola shows in nearly every scene
the insanity of their surroundings and the twisted world of war in which they live. He succeeds in using his film to immerse the audience as much as possible in the hell this war created in the minds of the veterans forced to endure it.
There have been four great films about that war: The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Coming Home, and this one - but it is this one, Coppola's, that seems most personal."
"This is a really great, classic movie. The cinematography, acting, music, atmosphere and writing are all sound. Creepy and intense at parts. Very effective, and maybe one of my favourite movies about Nam now."
"Coppola's greatest work. The incredibly stunning cinematography along with the unforgettable performances from Duvall, Sheen and a stand out performance from Brando, makes this film one of the greatest to hit the screen.The legendary scene featuring The Ride of the Valkyries can also not go unmentioned.A cinematic masterpiece.The Horror... The Horror"
"This film was incredibly well done, and the similarities to Conrad's Heart of Darkness were amazing, creating a similar message in the end. The first scene is everything: the cinematography was perfect, and The End by the Doors as the soundtrack worked eerily well. Lighting throughout the movie, especially surrounding the mysterious Kurtz (although it was needed) also worked well to establish the mood. Throughout the movie, we are encouraged to see that Kurtz' inhumanity likely stems from being put in a situation where he answers to (essentially) no one, where there are no rules, and where morals he thought he once had fell apart. Maybe, it is more the absence of ""civilization"" that leads to the ""civilization"" that encourages inhumane treatment. It is human nature that is at fault, not any individual or group. The encouragement of American society for Kurtz to act in this way also definitely had an effect on him, but this is also human nature in a way. Human nature includes the elite's love for power and their ability to send others off to do the dirty work as well as the quality of obedience in those ""others"". All of these are human biases, and it seems like only the people who have a great deal of self-awareness/control would be able to overcome them. Coppola's genius in Apocalypse Now encourages us to recognize that we all have darkness inside of us, but it is our ability to overcome this madness, even in the face of no authority or laws OR in the face of authority that is evidently incorrect, that is what matters. This movie, like Conrad's masterpiece, also raises the following questions: When to ""shield"" the truth? Who should do so? Does anyone have the right to do so? Should the public have full access to all knowledge? It makes sense to think that the general public is sometimes not in the position to make a good judgement call and that emotions would cloud our judgement. But this mindset is also dangerous for the people who ultimately make the call, as it places them on a pedestal that could then cloud their judgement. Hard question that we need to ask ourselves...There are also apparent differences between Apocalypse Now and Heart of Darkness. For example, in Heart of Darkness, the British Empire stands firm, with Conrad seeming to respect the British Empire endlessly. With such a positive view of the motherland, the implications in Heart of Darkness in terms of England seem to be that all is not yet lost and there is some hope for mankind after all. The film is entirely different; after watching it and learning of the Vietnam war, few people would dare to advocate for the US as a solution to any problem today. This then leads us to the opposite conclusion: that America has absolutely no right to put itself on a pedestal that creates 'good' in the world. And of course, in today's view, this idea is much more realistic and applicable. I appreciate that Coppola urges his audience to recognize that America is not some heaven and also to look back on history and our mistakes. This movie was very well done, with aspects like sound and editing coming together to create a masterpiece, and raises difficult questions that we must ask ourselves."
"I have to admit, the first and only six times I saw the original version of this film (not ""Redux""), I fell asleep during the film. I was convinced that the original film was made catastrophically unwatchable by the muddled and misguided editing. Several of my friends were angry to the respect that I could actually fall asleep to the ""best film ever"", in their opinion. As a result, I was relieved when I found out that there was going to be a release of a new version to theatres, a ""director's cut"", if you will. I purposely waited until it was released on DVD to watch it, and turned the English subtitles on, and I was glad, because I remember lots of the dialog being lost in the original mix (as I think it is also in this as well), but I feel the subtitles help you get through it. You see, I am the kind of person who likes director's cuts, uncensored versions, restored with new footage films, and even letterbox versions, basically the best way a film is intended. There are some exceptions to the rules, like when different editing processes are used, such as ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", which I still think was a mistake that George Lucas didn't correct some of the very noticeable errors in digital vs. analog editing and prints (i.e. he really should have either re-filmed the original Jabba-the-Hut & Han Solo conversation, instead of a digital re-creation and insertion/replacement of an analog filming of someone different {Jabba}, or just kept the scene cut indefinitely), or when studios take control of films and try to make their own edit and commercial cuts, which is almost always monstrous, just as I've heard with Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"". To summarize, it is possible for someone who has issues with this original film to like the ""Redux"" version, if it is for the reasons as I stated, because I feel that ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" actually is a better film than the original ""Apocalypse Now"". Yes, I am bold enough to say it. I am positive that this will offend people who think the original cut is the ""best film ever"", and I know it is even probable they won't like -this- version, but I don't care about that, just like I didn't rate this version 5-stars, or even think of it as the ""best film ever"". This film clearly travels the waters between pure evil and insane genius. This is the only version worth watching. 8/10"
"It's that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-cut, re-up, Redux 22 years after it's original release.The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's main plot (if it has one) being Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the Colonel's story along the way.My initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times, especially early on, but at least a good dose of comedy is put in, in the form of surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses however, a good deal of tension is built up with Willard's reading through various reports on Col. Kurtz until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end.The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and I found the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but as the film progressed... I'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better, or it fitted better, or if it had just grown on me, but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying it.This is the second time I have seen the Redux version, (I have seen the original around four times) I'll say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a ""classic"" film, with lots of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot), in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based), as the second time around, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favourite films.With the big four Vietnam films, Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere, but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work, especially towards the end where it becomes staggering, and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence."
"You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of ""judgement""); that layer is completely uninteresting.Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.You can try to view this as a 'realistic' Vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.Or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there, either.Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unsound methods', in spite of his strategic genius.So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando's greatness. To hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as Hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: ""the horror..."" Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including 'being in the firefight' long before ""Private Ryan""; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference."
"Sometimes films are not what I would consider entertainment. Those films I usually avoid. I have watched this film about 5 times in the past few years and my interest in it has grown. To say this film is boring may be going too far, however the idea that you may find some parts seem to drag is understandable. I think watching it a few times gives the same effect as having traveled somewhere several times. That 1 hour commute doesn't seem too long after driving it a few times. If on the first viewing, you find it to be totally boring, then maybe you will not even give it the consideration of a second watch thought I hope you do.This movie would get 9/10 from me IF Dennis Hopper's character was omitted or at least replaced by more dialog from the green beret character that has zero lines.In my definition: Entertainment doesn't necessarily require you to become excited or happy. Entertainment is enjoying the passage of your time with minimal effort. This movie allows me to pass time, stimulates my thoughts and emotion, and all I have to do is stare at a screen and eat popcorn."
"Two words: Cutting edge. The film remained quite different from its surroundings at the time. It was the first war film in a long time to receive good acting while many war films were about glory and pure action. It depicted war as a depressing era of death and insanity. While other Nam movies like The Killing Fields (although a great movie) just killed off soldiers, Apocalypse Now made you feel like you lost a member of your family when a soldier died. I felt that the film was to long but with all the information in the film, it couldn't have been shorter. For todays standards people of a younger generation will not appreciate the brilliancy of this film sheerly because from a war film they would expect more violence than dialogue. The Redux version does not compare to the original version and many people will seem impatient as they watch. I suggest eighteen or over not because of the violence, but because it will not appeal to someone younger than that age."
"It has been called ""Simply the best movie ever made!"", while most viewers are just calling it the best war-movie ever made. After watching ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"" twice, I don't think the film earns any of those titles. But Francis Ford Coppola, the man behind one of our time's greatest movie-masterpieces: ""The Godfather"" (1972), has made a film about the Vietnam-war that's a pretty unique movie-experience. This is a must for everyone who like artistic cinema.Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is a national hero with a career in the army which is full of merits of bravery and honour. But now he has gone insane, and has escaped from the army and into the jungle of Vietnam, where he is living as a king among an army of his own. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is being given the mission of finding Kurtz and ""terminate"" him. Together with some young unexperienced soldiers, he starts the search. In a boat, through a river, the journey goes deep into the jungle. A slow journey into the insanity and madness of the war...a journey to hell on earth.Now, can this film really be called a war-movie? The reason I ask this question, is because I feel that this film has its focus on the people in the war, and their experiences and reflections, rather than the war itself. This is not about people fighting in the war, but a story that takes place in Vietnam DURING the war. But this is probably just one of many questions that Coppola wanted people to ask themselves after a weird, thought-provoking, shocking, ""tormenting"" and totally unique film-experience like this.The most notable thing about ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"", and probably the most impelling part is the cinematography...beautiful and perfect. And over all, I think this film has its definite strength in the visual part, but Coppola's directing and contribution to the score should also be mentioned. It all sets a very special mood for the film, and provides a unique movie-experience that it's hard to not be impressed by. I'm also convinced that this is the most artistic war-movie ever made...it even tops Terrence Mavelick's poetic ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998) when it comes to artistic expressions, in my opinion. So if you like challenging films with depth, I think you should see this film, no matter what you've read or heard about it.""Apocalypse Now! Redux"" has also a solid cast. Martin Sheen is doing very well in the exacting leading role as Captain Benjamin Willard. Actors such as Dennis Hopper, Frederic Forrest and Marlon Brando is also giving good performances in a film with characters that seems to have a total lack of ""normal"" persons. A young Lawrence Fishburne also shows up and gives a approved performance as Tyrone Miller. But the most memorable performance of the film is being delivered by Robert Duvall. His character Lt. Bill Kilgore is among the most famous in film-history, and the way Duvall portrays him is pure brilliance.I haven't seen the original ""Apocolypse Now!"" from 1979 with the running time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, but I feel that the running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes is the weakness of ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"". I know long-time admirers of ""Apocalypse Now!"" (1979) has embraced the added scenes in the Redux-version, but I personally found the film a bit long-winded when it approached 3 hours. I think the scenes where Cpt. Willard and his companions visit a French plantation in the middle of the jungle, is the film's lowest point, and there's also some other scenes that lacks consistency, and that's not strengthening the film.With ""Apocalypse Now! Redux"", Francis Ford Coppola has made a spectacular piece of cinema. Visually, it is perfect and over all this is a film that all film-enthusiasts should experience at least once. But I think the average movie-viewer should go for the original version from 1979. This is a very good film, but not exactly a Top-Rated masterpiece, in my opinion. And if you really want a film about the Vietnam-war, I think Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" (1986) would be a better choice.8.5 out of 10"
"The cinematography is top notch, as is the sound, but the movie itself is uneven, dull at times and too long. Sheen is exciting as Willard. Brando is dull...dull...DULL! I wonder if he read the book ""Heart of Darkness."" Duvall is off the wall crazy, while Hopper...Hopper is just high!The film has moments of excitement, but they are all matters of cinematography, such as the beginning of the film. Other than that, this is a film that should have went to the editing room and stayed there."
"I understand that they wanted to make a war movie, however the movie could have been a 10 if they had followed the book more closely. Something somebody else has tried, but failed. Marlon Brando is unforgettable as the colonel, that cannot be denied."
"I think a lot of people who think this film is a classic are stupid idiots, the only memorable scene in the film is when they drop exploding napalm exploding and the guy in the hat says ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"", the rest of the film is a completely boring bombshell and it's like the film was high on drugs as there's this one part where people are butchering a cow in the most grotesque way possible... now I'm offended by this film.This film is just weird, the characters are not memorable at all not even Marlon Brando's character, the story is non-existent and the ending just sucks. Overall this film is absolutely terrible."
"Beware, my friends.  Though bold and striking, this is not a movie that should show its face in the new millennium or any era of artistic expression evolved beyond adolescence.  Casual film-goers will probably be impressed at the scenery, the grandeur and the theatrics as I was when I was 16.  But years later, I've matured a bit, and I am absolutely horrified and sickened at how I was duped.  (It's not unlike the feeling of rummaging through your old 80s wardrobe and seeing those ""cool"" parachute pants, acid-washed jeans and Miami Vice sockless-loafers accusing you from beyond the grave!)Not all of you, but an (enlightened?) minority WILL BE OFFENDED by this movie.  Certainly the veterans of Vietnam will smell something rank about how Mr. Coppola made such a pretentious carnival out of that truly humbling and difficult time.  But what I found utterly damning of this film, despite the best efforts of performers, were the atrocities that Mr. Coppola committed for the sake of his magnum opus.  A bull was slaughtered live and on camera just for some added gore (of which there is no shortage in this movie).  Acres of beautiful, Filipino countryside were ignited with Hollywood napalm (gasoline).  And last but not least, an entire culture was slandered beyond belief to a degree from which they may not have yet recovered.A few years ago, a New York radio personality gained enormous popularity with his irreverent and vulgar on-air antics.  I admit that at the time I was amused by the novelty, but then I grew up.  It may be a few decades yet, but I have enough faith in human/artistic evolution that this movie will similarly be relegated to its proper place as a monumental but shameful part of our ever-growing history.My advice to those of you with unquenchable curiosity?  Before contributing to the popularity and profits of this production (as I foolishly did), borrow a copy of this movie from someone and watch it secretly, as you would a horrible car wreck on the side of the road."
"Praise all that is holy that others hate this as much as I do. What a bunch of self-indulgent, bloated trash. It's one of those films people insist they love to appear cultured and intelligent. No, people, it isn't a fascinating insight into the mental scars that war leaves on the minds of men, or some other left-wing crap like that. It's a poncy director with an ego of such magnitude that it has it's own gravity spewing the usual ""war is hell"" crap.I almost survived this movie when Robert Duvall appeared, I thought ""finally, a likable, insane character who will be funny to watch."" then, after like 30 seconds of screen time, he is gone, and just becomes a sad old codger wanting his surfboard back. Like stealing an old man's teeth just so he ineffectually asks for them back.The politics of the US at the time obviously formed the film in part, and I'm with Cartman on this one, I HATE hippies, and this film is just a hippy with far too much money saying ""we should all just get along man, and in the meantime, marvel at my depth, artistry and intelligence. Peace."" A war gets televised, people eating their TV dinners see that people actually get killed when countries fall out, and suddenly you have a bunch of naive, pig ignorant celebrities siding with the opposition, an opposition that on winning the war, proceed to slaughter millions of men women and children in the Cambodian holocaust.Bunch of damn John Lennons. ""Imagine there're no possessions. Oh, haven't seen the keys to my sports car and swish apartment in new york have you?"""
"I would have given this a 9/10 as it is a superb movie.But showing heartless animal snuff to visualize heartless human war is sarcasm at best. It would totally be fitting and OK if it were special FX, but it weren't. Mr. Coppola even ""went overboard"" with ""a truckload of animals to slaughter"". No sir. That's not OK.Special-FX would have been believable enough to ""shock"" and to show the similarity between the sacrifice of the buffalo and of Kurtz. The film would have not suffered an inch of credibility, nor a tiny fragment of it's impact. The contrary would have been more likely.And no, I'm no fighter for animal rights and omnivore myself, but this is USELESS. A heartless Mr. Coppola trying to convince me, the viewer, that war is senseless and what not. He didn't even understand his own vision himself as it seems by such a behavior.I'm stopping here, because no one is ever reading this. But if, here is the reason why I down voted this. And usually I won't do that just to express my opinion or hate of a genre or whatever."
"What a waste of my time! I DID like Apocalypse Now quite a lot, but I'm so absolutely disgusted by the ""REDUX"" that I'll never watch either again. It's one thing to act, it's quite another to show someone hacking at a water buffalo with a machete FOR REAL!!!!! Perhaps before the movie started, a comment that stated it contained the butchering of real animals would have been appropriate! An unacceptable rating from the humane society isn't enough, not by a long shot. For all those who would say it was a ritual that these people actually perform, I say this... I wasn't watching a documentary of fact, nor was I watching a movie that gave the slightest indication that it contained such nightmarish images! NASTY!"
"I don't write many reviews, but after watching this so called ""masterpiece"" or ""classic"" last night for the first time i feel it warrants it, i need to warn people like myself about it. STAY AWAY!, it's 3 hours of your life you'll never get back. I like Martin Sheen, Brando, Larry Fishbourne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper....heck i like all the cast. Francis Ford Coppola is a legendary director. I like war films. What i don't like....is Apocalypse Now. It drags on and on....and on, and then the ending is a complete anti-climax. Robert Duvall's surfing obsessed Lt. Colonel is the best part about this film, he's a breathe of fresh air in an otherwise over rated movie...."
"Films like ""apocalypse now"", ""the godfather"" and ""the deer hunter"" all have a somewhat similar feel to them. They are all boring as hell, too long and way overrated. In my opinion, they really need pulling down a peg or two. OK, so maybe I just don't get it, and we'll leave it at that. But I see there are plenty of others here who feel exactly the same as I do, thank god. It's very hard to comprehend how films that are regarded as the best appear to me as some of the worst I've ever seen.I honestly don't know what to say. It really was that much of a snooze-fest for me. The only feelings I can describe to you of me watching the film, was boredom and me thinking about cutting the hedges back at the farm I help out on tomorrow morning. I really did just start to think of other things and forgot about the movie I was watching. 2001: a space odyssey? yup, slow, but brilliant and captivating. But this? man, I...I just don't get it. A man sails up a river....All power to you if you like this. But not for me, thank you"
"I remembered this film as one of my all-time favorite films, that is, until I saw it again recently on DVD in my stunning new home theater with terrific sound. What seemed to be evocative intrigue many years ago, seems now to be simply OVERDONE and self-indulgent on the part of a director struggling too hard for immortality through this film.  Sure, the visuals delight the eye with seductive color and convincing composition, but it's the storytelling that falls far short on this new viewing becoming nothing more than a murky ""purple haze"".  I understand the effort to give the film a feel of the drug-induced horror, but, it does so at the expense of everything else.Some of my favorite films are great heroic epics, such as The English Patient, Lawrence of Arabia, Saving Private Ryan, Deer Hunter,  even Gladiator, but Apocalypse Now, despite some excellent scenes (Duvall's character on the beach; the killing of the boat family; the death by arrow of the boat's ""Chief""), seems on the whole to fall terribly short of masterpiece material.  The ending was completely disgusting to me, when the slaughter of the carribou parallels the killing of Kurtz.  Then to read in the credits or somewhere else on the DVD that they did actually slaughter a carribou ritually for this film, just put me over the edge as far as this film is concerned.  It's one thing to suggest violence in a film, but to actually use it in a film is just outrageous. I'll never waste my time on this film again!"
"What an awful movie. The worst thing of all is the amount of written material and other forms of mystification produced about it. The whole film is based on the terrible misreading of Joseph Conrads brilliant ""Heart of Darknes"". Coppola turned something which is genuinely a brilliant piece of written fiction into a 3 or more hours of visual disaster. A complex narrative turned into an ordinary kitsch. If there is nothing to understand, it doesn't mean it's masterpiece; it's just stupid. This film is just going nowhere from the beginning to the end. The final scenes, involving Hopper and Brando are the lamest thing I've ever seen. I mean, it's more lame than Troll2: totally bizarre and unmotivated. Read ""Heart of Darkness"" and you'll see what I'm talking about. From technical aspect film is really marvelous, but the whole concept is so pathetic that nothing can save it. Disaster. 1/10"
"I just saw the film for the first time and the opening scene with Martin Sheen in the bedroom I thought was promising. But I think that was the only part of the film that made me think this was worthy of an Oscar. I can understand all the hype about this film back in the day way before CGI came along – the logistics and the scale of the film set were all real. But that's all I could possibly like about it. It was too long and wasn't engaging enough to keep me awake. This couldn't possibly get any nominations by today's standards. I was struggling to stay awake only because my good friend who highly recommended it was watching with me. Otherwise, I would have stopped watching and gone to bed half-way through the movie. I was lost every time a long scene came along with lengthy, boring dialogues. Overrated, bad-acting, tried-to-be-arty snooze-fest, I reckon."
