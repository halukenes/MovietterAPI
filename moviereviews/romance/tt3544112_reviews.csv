"I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. I believe that this is in my top 3 movies of the year so far and that's why everyone should give it a watch. Trust me you will not be disappointed at all. Its an amazing movie for all ages.Also the acting is great and the 80s of course give the movie a nostalgic and beautiful tone"
"I'm a huge fan of the movie Once. When I arrived at South By Southwest, and saw that John Carney had directed another movie, I have to say I was a bit skeptical that he could capture the magic of that movie again without the amazing music and raw performances of Glen Hansard.My fears were unfounded.SING STREET is a heartfelt, funny and artful coming-of-age movie set in 1985 Dublin. I'm close to an ideal audience member for this film, because I grew up in the 80s myself, a child of the MTV Generation. I count John Hughes' films and the Cameron-Crowe scripted Fast Times At Ridgemont High among the most influential films of my childhood. They are the reason I became a screenwriter, and why I continue to write movies for a teen audience.Sing Street truly hearkens back to those great teen movies of the 80s. The best stories about teenagers are rooted in pain and isolation, and this is no different - Connor ""Cosmo"" Lawler comes from an upper middle class family that has fallen on hard times. His parents have constant fights. His older brother Brendan is a college dropout and his sister, the 'smart one,' pretty much keeps to herself. In order for the family to save money, Connor is transferred to the local Catholic boys school, where he's quickly made an outcast and an example by the authoritarian headmaster.You could say that this is a movie about forming a band. And this genre of story - of artistic awakening - seems to be replayed quite often in British and Irish films like The Commitments, Billy Elliott, The Full Monty, and others. But those movies each had a unique wrinkle, and Sing Street does too. It's the beautifully told story of the way that the inspiration and inception of the best art is rarely an individual act of genius, but rather, the result of a series of interconnected acts of human desire and emotion.It's the parents who sentence you to a horrible school; the girl who you long for that won't give you the time of day; the other guys who join your band because they're outcasts too... the brother who loves you too much, and is too angry at his own cowardice, to let you settle for less than your best.There's also a lot of great humor in Sing Street about the fact that you have to try on the styles of your heroes before you find your own confidence. 40-something audiences will definitely get another level of enjoyment out of all the allusions to great 80s bands. The art direction and costumes are done wonderfully in that respect. But I think this movie will work wonderful for today's teenagers as well.The movie is by turns funny, heart-wrenching, soaring and surprising. And the musical numbers, while not necessarily Oscar winning, like Once, is great. I'm thrilled that a new generation of teenagers will get to experience the release of a movie that's on par with the films I love so much as a kid."
"The movie to beat this summer isn't a superhero movie.Its a movie about a teenager forming a band to try and impress a girl. What a wonderful and beautiful movie this. I was smiling and hugging myself throughout. So light and warm hearted and funny and yet deep and powerful. The Music is amazing even the original songs are fantastic. It is directed by the great John Carney who directed one of my favorite movies about music, Once. This is one of the best coming of age stories I've ever seen. It stands with Say Anything, Stand By ME, Perks of Being a wallflower, The fault in our stars. Please just go watch this movie. Please. I Loved it. ***** out of 5."
"I'm happy to grade this movie a full blast 10. I was a teenager in 1985 in the last private Catholic Boarding School left in Mexico City. I relate to the strict uniform policy, the angry and imperfect young Catholic brothers still guessing their vocations, the old professors teaching materials for yester years, the canteen food, hiding Walkman radios and sunglasses, talking about bands across the ocean, the girls who wanted to be older and the fashion. This is a happy sad movie, that will keep you tapping and asking why aren't all movies like this. The script is very very smart, the casting couldn't be wiser. Lucy Boynton does an amazing job. The art direction is so precise you can imagine the smell of the flats. The awesome cars. What a great movie!!Don't miss this!!!"
"Sing Street (2016): Films about people at school forming bands are well known for being 60% more lovable than any other sort, and this movie is no exception.Sing Street,directed by Irish Film maker John Carney,has already been nominated for 74th Golden Globe Awards but sadly it will lose it to La La Land.If not for La La Land,Sing Street has all the necessary emotions and qualities to win a best musical movie of 2016.Why am I boasting it up before the review?You will see..Plot:SING STREET takes us back to 1980s Dublin seen through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy named Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) who is looking for a break from a home strained by his parents' relationship and money troubles, while trying to adjust to his new inner-city public school where the kids are rough and the teachers are rougher. He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, über-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band's music videos. There's only one problem: he's not part of a band...yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he's promised and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos.In a sea of opportunities ahead of them, what does the future hold for a love like this?Plus Points:1)Music: Sing Street is brilliant mostly because of its music.Much of the original music by the band ""Sing Street"" was composed by 80s veteran composer Gary Clark,which really gives us some nostalgic 80's rocking music with meaningful lyrics.For every 5 minutes a song always plays and it played a brilliant part in the movie.""The Riddle of the Model"" is one of the best track from this movie.I loved the other tracks too.2)Performances: Newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is outstanding in his role and he surely has a bright future ahead.He surely is a Futurist:)When Conor gives an early Sing Street song called The Riddle of the Model to Raphina, he assures her: ""It's not about you. It's about another model I know."" Walsh-Peelo delivers the line with just the right mixture of shyness and teenage petulance.The other one I liked in this movie is Mark McKenna who played the role Eamon who has talent to play any kind of instrument.Lucy Boynton is lovely.Especially during the shoot of The Riddle of the Model,her expressions are marvelous.Jack Reynor as Brendon is very good in his role.3)Screenplay and Direction: Sing Street has the most familiar plot for a musical drama but John Carney successfully made such a beautiful engaging drama with a perfect script.Sing Street is, in fact, a delightful coming-of-age tale that both celebrates young love and laments how quickly the fire of youth can be snuffed out. Director John Carney knows exactly how to mesh storytelling and music into his films.He is the next best after Damien Chazelle in directing a perfect musical picture.A great applause for Carney.So,Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.One of the best musicals in recent times.My rating 8/10"
"There's nothing quite like the creative process. We've all had that feeling; unfolding with all its frenzied excitement, malleable thoughts and brainstorms and inventive problem-solving. Yet creativity isn't just limited to what music you make, what stories you write, what paintings you paint. Flexing the limits of your creativity is almost like a window into your identity. Do you look for the easy fix, do you power through despite mental blocks, do you try the unexpected or bend towards an originality or an universality. So it goes with Sing Street, a movie that expands the notion of creativity itself, making an unabashedly and irresistibly charming film.Conor Lalor (Walsh-Peelo) and his family live in a charmed dwelling overlooking the urban sprawl of South side Dublin. Due to financial strain, Conor is informed that he's being taken out of his private Jesuit high school and being transferred to a public school nearby. At first, things go miserably. He's hassled by bullies, called names openly in class and harangued by the school's principal Father Baxter (Wycherley). His only solace is watching new wave music videos with his older brother Brendan (Reynor). Things change however with the appearance of the mysterious and strikingly beautiful Raphina (Boynton) who stands on the stoop outside the school. He approaches her and asks her to be in a music video; she agrees. Next step: start a band.Conor quickly makes friends with a gaggle of outcasts from the school in order to haphazardly start, build and maintain a fledgling little group. Among them is the multi-talented Eamon (McKenna) who can not only play multiple instruments but can put Conor's lyrics to song. It is the moments between these two young artists that best exemplifies the movie's central theme. We share with them the 4am feeling of unbounded imaginative bliss as they riff off each other, clean up their chords and rhythms and ask each other the meaning behind the songs they write. Because of Eamon's father's vocation as a covers band leader, the band not only has a place to practice but instruments to play which benefits the rest of the players as they develop their sound.Conor uses his band not only for the purpose of wooing the girl but also as a means to escape his increasingly turbulent home life. The marriage between his mother (Doyle Kennedy) and father (Gillen) circles the drain as his dropout brother smokes hash and oozes cynicism and unrealized potential. In one moment of investigation, Brendan points to the mother who sits on the stoop, smoking a cigarette, hoping to catch the last rays of sunshine of the day. With big talk of some day going to Paris, the mother settles on these moments to sulk in bitter reflection. ""I cleared a path for you."" Brendan says in a moment of defeat. Seems his carefully curated collection of vinyl and his grimacing observations serve as a counterpoint to encourage Conor's brazen dreams.Yet it's the girl who pushes Conor to the point of unique creative verisimilitude. And as the would-be model that captures the heart of our young hero, Lucy Boynton is an absolute vision. She coyly hints at gigs and glamour in London yet she lives at an all girls boarding house and dates a guy who listens to Genesis. Yet despite outward moments of confident sashaying, behind the makeup and denim there beats the heart of a true romantic and a true creative conduit. ""When it comes to art, you never go halfway."" she says just after she throws herself into the Irish Sea for the sake of a good video. This moment is immediately followed by Conor responding in kind.And yes this movie is about a new wave band in the 1980's, so yes there is a lot of hair, makeup, posh scarf wearing and mod style bravado. While today we like to take potshots at the synth-pop aesthetic, there's still something utterly charming about the way it is presented here. Is it nostalgia; probably. Yet there's an unawareness to it, allowing the audience to discover (or re-discover) the trappings of 80's popular music in real time. The excitement Brendan and Conor feel in watching Duran Duran's Rio music video is infectious, and the original songs by the band are easily the best thing about Sing Street.Conor eventually finds a since of identity within the catchy rhythms of his songs, the jejune charms of Raphina and the kindliness of Brendan's brotherly love. The moments of kitchen sink realism serves not only as a cautionary tale to Conor but to us as well. When we refuse ourselves the rewards of creativity we risk becoming embittered, angry and resentful. In the words of Kurt Vonnegut, ""Go into the arts. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow."" To put it another way, go create something."
"I'm a sucker for movies about musicians, and John Carney has already given us Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). Now he delights once more with Sing Street, a tale told with humor, drama, and some pretty catchy songs, all set in the backdrop of 1980's Dublin.Yes, Sing Street is set in the 80's so it undeniably lends itself to comic relief as these schoolboys are forced to navigate through hair, makeup, clothing and music video choices along their artistic journey. We get plenty of laughs as we watch them try to forge an identity and look like bona-fide rock stars in this crazy MTV generation. And for good measure, they insert the obligatory Phil Collins joke in the mix.There is quite a deal of drama as well. We see bullying in an all-boys school, dysfunctional families, the economic hardships of Ireland in the 80's and young people's wish to break out of societal malaise and seek their fortunes elsewhere. I haven't lived in Ireland but the desire to pack your bags and start over in another place is a universal one. Audiences in every continent can relate to that.The cast is solid and I was very impressed with the leads, especially Ferdia Walsh-Peelo who plays Connor. He can be charming, kind, insecure but out-of-nowhere gutsy which is an accurate depiction of a blossoming musician. After the first hour I began to be doubtful of the character of Connor's brother Brendan for seeming to be too wise for his age, but by the end of the film it all made sense, and Jack Reynor was a fine choice for that role. Lucy Boynton (Raphine) is great as the love interest and mysterious but troubled muse; she packs an emotional performance and probably looks the most natural in 80's fashion, although she didn't quite convince me as a 16 year-old and it wasn't because of all the excess hair and makeup. On the other hand Mr. Walsh-Peelo (Connor) was only 15 when the movie was shot and he's got that boyish appearance. Finally Mark McKenna (Eamon) has such an uncanny resemblance to Julian Lennon it's scary! But a good actor too.As far as concerns I had only a few major ones but they didn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. First is that the story moves very quickly in the first 30 minutes or so, then takes the foot off the pedal for the remainder. And second, it's a little unrealistic that these kids can write quality songs right out of the blocks. It would have been fun to hear a real stinker when they're starting out. I'm a musician and believe me, our first attempts are pretty bad. That's true even for the all-time best.There were a few other minor things but they're not worth mentioning. This is a great story, it got all the laughs, cheers and tears in the right places and I would recommend it to everyone, especially those who want to express themselves through art and aspire to greatness. Dream big, all you adolescents. A big thanks to John Carney et al for reminding us of that and making a quality film."
"Ah, the joy and pain of first love! Young Conor (aka Cosmo, played in his impressive debut by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) has the smelly end of a shitty stick to deal with while growing up in 1980's Dublin. He has warring parents with the need – for financial reasons - to move Conor from his posh school to 'Singe Street' Catholic school: a decidedly rougher and tougher place, ruled over with a rod of iron by Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley). This is a place of chaos and mayhem, ruled over by bullies of the likes of Barry (a superbly intimidating Ian Kenny).The 15 year old Conor tries punching above his weight with the lovely 16 year old Raphina (Lucy Boynton) – a struggling wannabe model with ""mysterious eyes"" who hangs around outside the Woman's Refuge opposite the school. To get her number, he claims to head up a band and to need her help with the band's video. One small problem: there is no band and Conor has limited musical ability! He gathers around him a motley crew of friends, and with the help of his stoner brother (Jack Raynor) and his extensive vinyl collection, goes about creating a band to gain fame and fortune (or at least the girl).This is a film that works on so many levels. As a piece of nostalgia for us older folks, the sights and sounds of the 80's are brought vividly back to life, with a rocking soundtrack of the likes of Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet to enjoy. And as a coming of age movie, the long lingering looks, embarrassment and discomfort of first-dating is both touching and painful to watch, with the best Rich-Tea fuelled snog ever put on screen! Few films in fact have come this close to depicting this glorious ineptitude since John Gordon Sinclair and Dee Hepburn struggled to get together in Bill Forsyth's ""Gregory's Girl"" (making me feel ancient, this was actually set in 1981!).It should be noted that at one point the film also models the casual racism prevalent at the time, with perhaps only the addition of a rebuking ""You can't say things like that"" striking a less realistic note. This is a film where nearly everyone is damaged in one way or another – drugs; hopeless ambition; child abuse; paedophilia, alcoholism; bullying; (the list goes on). However, the hugely intelligent script by writer and director John Carney drips the issues out in such tiny insinuations and snippets of conversation that it feels lifelike: not as if the film-maker is beating you over the head with it. This is just a poor Dublin life in the 80's: get on with it.All of this might make you think this is a hugely depressing, kitchen-sink type of drama that will leave you, at the end of the evening, in dire need of a box-set of ""Father Ted"" to cheer you up. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the same way as the music in Alan Parker's 1991 Dublin-set classic ""The Commitments"" - and indeed 2013's excellent Belfast-based ""Good Vibrations"" - lifted the spirits, so the drive and energy of the soundtrack makes the film a hugely uplifting experience. Besides the classic 80's stuff there are some really great original songs (co-written by the multi- talented John Carney, with Gary Clark): I was still humming ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" in the car park. The young cast throw themselves into the job with great energy, with Walsh-Peelo and Boynton delivering touching and impressive performances and Mark McKenna particularly worthy of note channeling a young John Lennon. My top acting accolade though goes to Jack Raynor (who was until recently rumoured to be in the running for the role of the young Han Solo: a role that's now just gone to ""Hail Caesar's"" Alden Ehrenreich). Playing Conor's older and wiser brother, his frustration at his role in life boils over in a vinyl- smashing and hugely impressive rant that I would like to see credited with a Best Supporting Actor award. And amid all of the teenage love and band efforts, it is this aspect of brotherly love that eventually shines out as the beating heart of the film. The film is a little rough at the edges – a dream sequence looks like it could have had a few more dollars thrown at it - but this often adds to the charm. John Carney seems to have quite an Indie following, but I'm not familiar with his other work. This film left me wanting to dig into his archives. It left my wife gushing with tears from beginning to end! A must see film.(I loved it - did you?

"Few (if any) of us were who we wanted to be when we were in high school. While high school girls often think they're not pretty enough or popular enough, boys fear they're not cool enough or tough enough. Of course, these are only a few of the characteristics that teens in high school – both boys and girls believe they lack. The point is, during adolescence, all kids think that they're not ""enough"" of something. Well, I say ""enough already"" – and so does Irish writer-director John Carney, through his music-oriented comedy-drama ""Sing Street"" (PG-13, 1:46). This is a film that shows us it's okay to be insecure and sad sometimes, but you can also learn to be happy during those times and even to rise above them. ""Happy-Sad"" the film calls it. I call the film insightful, encouraging and entertaining.Conor Lalor (Ferdia Walsh Peelo) is, in many ways, a typical 15-year-old. He goes to school, where he has both friends and enemies. He has family members who love him, but also add challenges to his life. And, of course, he wants to earn the affections of someone special who has caught his eye. The details of the framework of Conor's life may differ from yours (as well as his gender, interests, location and even time period), but he should be easy to relate to – for anyone who attended (or is now attending) high school.As for Conor, he lives in Dublin, Ireland in 1985. He has a brother (six years older) named Brendan (Jack Raynor), who is out of school but still lives at home, and a younger sister named Ann (Kelly Thornton). Their parents (Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy) argue – loudly – about money, their kids, their marriage, etc. Conor has the experience of changing schools, starting at Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where, as the new kid, he quickly runs afoul of the principal (Don Wycherly) and the school bully (Ian Kelly). However, Conor soon makes a friend named Darren (Ben Carolan) and is quite taken by a mysterious girl named Raphina (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street from the school.As a way of getting to know Raphina, Conor asks her to be in a music video for his band. She agrees, so now all Conor has to do is start a band! He gets Darren to be the band's manager – slash – music video producer. Darren introduces Conor to Eamon (Mark McKenna), who is skilled at a variety of instruments. After the guys recruit from among their school mates, adding friends Larry (Conor Hamilton) and Gary (Karl Rice), along with Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), the only black kid at Synge Street CBS, they choose ""Sing Street"" as the name of their band, and start working on their band's musical and visual identity.Heavily influenced by early-mid 1980s acts like The Cure, Joe Jackson and Hall & Oates (whose songs appear in the soundtrack), Sing Street works up a cover of Duran Duran's ""Rio"" and then Conor and Eamon start writing original songs together. Brendan makes use of his misspent youth to school his younger brother in the finer points of modern music and encourages Conor to stretch musically. Soon, Raphina becomes Conor's muse and a regular in Sing Street's videos. Raphina and Conor also grow closer, in spite of her ""it's complicated"" relationship status and her plan to move to London to model.""Sing Street"" features a whole lot of talent – on both sides of the camera – and the microphone. Carney's direction and his script are sensitive, engaging and fun. The story has a lot going on, but still keeps things simple, and derives its entertainment value from a variety of sources. The drama comes from following the development of the band, the relationship between Conor and Raphina, the relationships within Conor's house and Conor's problems at school. The comedy comes from the behavior of the film's colorful characters and the natural awkwardness of teenagers discovering life.Carney says the film is ""wish fulfillment of all of the things I wanted when I was the age of the character and didn't do."" To portray a fictionalized version of his own adolescence, he cast unknown, but talented actors – with terrific results. Raynor creates an interesting and passionate character, who is dealing with the fear that life is passing him by. For their part, Walsh-Peelo and McKenna, besides being fine young actors, are talented musicians in real life – all the better to perform the film's excellent original songs.As the main character, Conor's struggles are relatable, his dreams are understandable and his story is enjoyable. The film isn't completely original or realistic, but it's very effective as a representation of the trials, tribulations and potential triumphs of the teenage years, and offers hope as to what could lie ahead – for those who make the most of those years – and the lessons they produce. ""You can never do anything by half,"" is one character's heart-felt proclamation. ""Sing Street"" continually speaks to the heart – through its comedy, its drama and its wonderful music – and doesn't do it by half. ""A-"""
"A beautifully balanced, sensibly narrated & splendidly performed indie covering the highs & lows of teenage life while demonstrating the magic of creating music with all the romance of the art in tact Sing Street is a heartfelt ode to the carefree, joyous days of growing up and with its subtle touch of melancholy & hummable soundtrack, delivers an experience that's delightfully captivating.Set in Dublin, Ireland during the 1980s, Sing Street tells the story of a young kid who is looking for an escape from all his troubles at home where his family is on the verge of falling apart, and at his new school where students & teachers are quite rough. His window of opportunity arrives when, in an attempt to impress a girl, he invites her to star in his band's music videos despite not being a part of one.Written & directed by John Carney, the movie packs just the right amount of heart, fun, nostalgia, heartaches & optimism and also benefits from the interesting set of characters the writer-director brings to life. The events progress in smooth, effective manner from start to finish while the songs are expertly placed at just the right moments to exquisitely capture the underlying context of the emotions on surface.Production design team does well to nicely capture the period details of the timeline its plot is set in. Cinematography encapsulates the entire feature with an overcast ambiance with warm & cold colours utilised as per the scene requirements. Editing provides a steady pace to its 105 minutes narrative with each scene only taking the story forward while songs are composed from scratch and have an infectious quality to them.Coming to the performances, Sing Street features a relatively unknown but incredibly committed cast in Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Lucy Boynton, Mark McKenna, Jack Raynor, Aidan Gillen & Maria Doyle Kennedy and everyone does an excellent job with what they are given. Walsh-Peelo in particular is a standout and shares brilliant chemistry with both Boynton & McKenna while Raynor pretty much steals the show in every scene he appears in.On an overall scale, Sing Street is the feel-good movie of the year that's euphonic in both happy & sad moments and manages to incorporate a mix of both with amazing comfort. A healthy dose of entertainment that treads the fine line between wishful fantasy & cold reality that promises plenty of laughs & hints of tears, this bittersweet coming-of-age musical comedy hits the right chords at the right time throughout its runtime and is one of the best films of 2016. Definitely recommended."
"I was a fan of Carney's band the Frames, and was delighted to see his first low budget film , ""Once"" His second wonderful film had a much bigger budget and well know cast, but still a small film. I just loved, ""Begin Again"" with Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine, and Kiera Knightly.He goes back to his roots with Sing Street and it is simply a joyful experience. It started off a bit slow for me. But as the band that is the focal point of the film hones their skills and improves so does this wonderful story. I just can't say enough about how great the two leads were in this film Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays the male lead Conor, and Lucy Boynton as Raphina were just wonderful. It is a great film to watch if you are having trouble getting your smile on. As an American I had a little trouble at times with the thick Irish accents. When I watch the CD I may have to stick the subtitles on.I wish the film had a bit of a bigger budget in the sense that it looks like it was made on a tiny budget and musicals are much better when the sound is powerful. But that is just quibbling. Go see this in the theaters, if for nothing else to make sure Carney gets money to keep making films."
"Greetings again from the darkness. The vast majority of 1980's music usually inspires nothing but groans and an immediate change of the radio channel from me. Yet writer/director John Carney masterfully captured and held my attention with this crowd-pleasing story that leans heavily on the tunes from that era.Mr. Carney was also responsible for two previous music-centric movies, Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). He is an exceptional story teller who puts music at the center, but avoids the label of ""musical"" by making it about people, rather than notes.It's 1985 in economically depressed Dublin, and a strong opening sequence introduces us to Connor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) as his ever-arguing parents (Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy) inform him of the economic necessity of pulling him out of prep school and enrolling him into a much tougher environment  one that comes with bullies and hard-nosed teachers/clergy.Soon enough Connor is hanging with the misfits and inviting an enchanting ""older"" girl to star in his band's video. She agrees, and wide-eyed Connor quickly sets out to form a band that didn't previously exist.There are two interesting and fully realized relationships that make this movie click: Connor and the enchanting Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and Connor and his older brother Brendon (Jack Reynor). Brendan is Connor's life mentor and music guru. They are quick to jump on the new world of music videos, and it's a real hoot to watch Connor emulate the style and fashion of Duran, Duran, The Cure, etc.It's fascinating to note that Connor, while a pretty talented lyricist and singer, doesn't really seem to be in love with the music except as a means to an end  a way to get the girl. That said, the real message here is that while teenagers often feel like they can't fix the outside world (parents, teachers, bullies), they can fix themselves by finding a passion in life (the movie uses the term vocation).It's hard not to notice the influence of such filmmakers as John Hughes and Cameron Crowe, and Carney certainly brings his touch of romanticism. Plus, one must appreciate any movie that delivers an original song as catchy as ""Drive it like you Stole it"", while also taking a shot at Phil Collins. It's a funny and sweet movie that should really catch on through positive word of mouth."
"Sing Street is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a real feel good, sweet movie that is a pure delight for anyone familiar with the eighties, the setting and atmosphere makes it convey very clear that we are in a very different time in Ireland. The original songs are magnificent, each one being annoyingly catchy and serving the plot very well. It is immensely funny, but also stands out in more dramatic moments that are mildly tense, and very real. The only aspect of the film that I did not particularly appreciate was the parents plot line. It was clearly trying to add an extra layer of difficulty to Conor's life, but it failed to grab me in any way. I did not care for his two dimensional mother and father, nor did I have any interest on seeing how their relationship pans out. The strongest part of the movie has to be Conor and Brendan's special brotherly bond, it is sweet, pure and I think any pair of brothers can relate to it. With the teasing that goes on between them, as well as the sincere care they both have for one another, the ending brought a tear to my eye as a result of how powerful Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Jack Reynor's relationship was. It made me experience many different emotions throughout, which is what the best movies do. Funny, heartwarming and wildly entertaining, Sing Street is worth the watch for anyone who is looking for a good comedy or music film. A young boy starts a band in order to get an older girls attention. Best Performance: Jack Reynor"
"I needed a movie like this in 2016, and I wish it could have come earlier. I didn't know they had decided to keep making films like this. 'Sing Street', on the surface, is a funny teenage movie about an Irish boy who starts a punk rock band in the 1980s to impress a girl he likes. This premise alone made me want to see it; it sounded hugely enjoyable for someone who loves rock and roll and loves (certain) teen movies. And I wasn't wrong, I had a great time with the film. But it's definitely more than what it sounds. The movie reminds me so much of 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', which is important to acknowledge because that film is one of the defining teen movies of a century devoid of good teen movies. I could count the 21st century gems on one hand, and the other lackluster attempts on ten. Both of these movies succeed in calling back to the glorious John Hughes era. They use their characters right, the dialogue works, and it's relatable for a teen audience. 'Sing Street' is about rebellion. About taking control of one's life and making memories, even if the steps you must take to get there seem too steep to climb. It's about finding out who this musically talented boy is through a journey in which his family is torn apart but his friendships are multiplied. It is heartfelt, beautifully shot, and comes complete with a hip soundtrack. One of the best movies of its year. 9/10"
"It's a few days before the end of May, 2016, and the year in film might already be over as far as I'm concerned. It did not seem that way to me after the first time I saw this film - the ""Mary Sue""-ism of the band's progress in quality, the strange appearance of a 1987 song in a 1985-set film (Starship's track at the party towards the end - from the movie 'Mannequin'), me asking myself which characters were responsible for editing the music video for 'Riddle of the Model' so decently / well?, and a couple more quibbles. These minor details became less important by the second viewing, and completely unimportant by the third and fourth viewings. They were replaced by: the girl that inspires your work, the work that allows you to ignore your current circumstances, the ""adults"", however few they may be, that actually notice what you're doing and encourage you / help you / are happily there for you, the friends you make as a result of putting yourself ""out there"", the joy of coming up with new material, ""who are you, Steely Dan?"", the fantastic storyline with Barry - the 'bully' who is incorporated into the group as the roadie with M's ""Pop Musik"" playing in the background, Brendan and Raphina meeting towards the end of the film, Eamon's mother (hahah), Flash and the Pan's ""Waiting for a Train"", The Cure on a film soundtrack, ""Depech-E Mode"", cookies between kisses, and Raphina... and Brendan. When even Adam Levine works perfectly for the film's ending, you know things are clicking.On a side note: my profile has my location as San Juan, Puerto Rico, but I did not see this film there... since it has not been shown there, and I unfortunately would not be surprised if it ended up not showing there at all before home video (hope I'm wrong).On a second side note: while in early high school, we tried to make a music video to compete in MTV's make-a-video contest for Madonna's track 'True Blue'... and failed impressively. Hence my immediately noticing the editing in 'RotM' :)"
"While we have not seen so simply and yet so Special for this kind of movie, charming from start to finish with a freshness and despite major cast of rookies a imposing professionalism. The message is clear from half the film, which leaves nothing to chance. With a very sensitive issue and deep.The soundtrack deserves a separate paragraph where we remember those glorious years of rock, and as mutates over time a It forms so well treated, from its essence to fashion and more.A highly recommendable film that left us with a taste nostalgic sweet and melancholy.To sit and enjoy."
"Wow. What an absolutely beautiful film. It is so simple. It is about teenagers in a band. But the humor is so well-timed, and the music so...awesome...that it is a real pleasure to watch. I only heard about Sing Street because of its Golden Globe nomination (which it completely deserved) and didn't watch it on Netflix until well through 2017. I regret not seeing it sooner.One of the great parts of Sing Street is that the teenagers are actually played by teenagers, not 20 year-olds pretending to be 14 (cough cough Spider-man). They're really believable kids, and just so likable. Their personal stories are interesting and the way they see the world is fascinating to experience. It all feels very real.Sing Street also has an INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK that compliments the story so well. Up is my favorite.Jack Reynor totally deserved his Irish Oscar. He was such a REAL older brother. I did it again, and said how real it felt. That's part of the beauty of the film. It just feels real. But back to Jack Reynor. I didn't know him from anything else, but he was so good in this that when I first saw his face as a racist cop in Detroit (a SUPER intense film) that I actually laughed. Thanks Sing Street.Must see film. Just bunny stuff."
"I thought that 2016 was dominated musically by ""La La Land"", but then I saw ""Sing street""...Well, what can I say - music is everything sometimes. And just sometimes - movie making through music is what it takes to make everyone feel so much better. Topics like family, growing up, friendship and love fill this movie with the necessary energy to carry you from beginning to end with joy and passion. I am truly inspired how the main characters start from the desire to be noticed and reach some of the highest peaks of originality in art. The 80's background music, set and costumes are far too attractive to be missed. And for me - these are all hallmarks of great directorship and cinematography. The desire to associate with, to give, to win, translates to the viewer the impression of youth's vigor and love towards pushing down walls and changing habits. The young cast of this film reminds us to never let the important things run out of our lives, no matter how hard the situation is. And always to share every spark of creativity. The unique cultural-historical perspective of this movie shows again how music connects past and future, now and then.Across cultures and distances we are interconnected by art, and in particular by good music. We can experience the passion to express ourselves all the way along our path of growing up and chasing our dreams. And to see once again how we must never lose grasp of our goals, no matter how hard it gets along the way.This movie is an excellent example of how the family can influence any young kid in both a good and a bad way. Also - the importance of a good advice against the malice of poverty and ignorance is really obvious. ""Sing Street""is the newest story of how love can actually save and dignify. But more than everything we see - how music can be a solution to all. And without any guaranteed success at the end, we enjoy this film as a really splendid creation of nostalgia, music and love.I truly recommend this small treasure to you and your close ones. We can never have too much music and love in our lives!"
"The movie somehow illuminates in the darkness surrounding the 7th art nowadays. Drawing a simple, yet powerful fable, using bold and at times even aggressive strokes, it creates a convincing story which will certainly affect most of the viewers.All the actors are great, but the youngsters are just fabulous. I am totally in love with Raphina and Conor has all my sympathies. The powerful performance by Jack Reynor (the big brother) comes as a surprise and provide an extra boost to the whole thing.It's a beautiful, beautiful movie. It is also fun and quite optimistic and I would recommend it to anyone."
"Brilliant. Once will forever be one of my desert island films, but Sing Street comes really close. Together with Begin Again, John Carney has made an amazing trilogy of 'music' films that beat with warm hearts of gold. This one is about a boy living in the 80s who wants to start a band because he likes a girl. A rather simple storyline but the execution is bliss. If you were weaned on songs from the 80s you are so going to love this. The music is of course A1, but I never counted the familiar story to be so winsome and endearing. It fricking made me tear up. The reason why it is so good is because Carney knows how to portray the kids and adults like how we think them to be in our idealistic minds. In our minds, at one time or another, we all wished we were like them. I love the banter between the boy and his older brother in the music man-cave. Doesn't anyone want an older brother like that. A bro that knows, feels, loves and understands music, and talks music like it is the only knowledge in the world worth knowing. Carney knows music and he uses it to bridge relationships and incidents in our lives, and it is about getting the girl. It is also about ""finding the happiness in sadness"" that transcends us to a new level, and ""no woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins"". I will remember that one 😬Thank you for the music lessons."
"Really captures its time, has a wonderful soundtrack, and a great concept. Does a really good job communicating the tone and the feeling of the plot, and none of the actors felt like actors. There were very many things done very well in this movie and very few things that noticeably would need improvement. It'd be an 8 in my books if not for just how well it captured 1980s Dublin. It definitely added to the film experience. If you're looking for a good film with good humour that tells a good story, this would be great option."
"Following Carney's stunning hit Once, his attempt at 2013′s Begin Again, although (at first glance) full of indie music-lover potential, never quite felt like it understood what you wanted it to be. Since re-watching Begin Again, hoping to find some reasoning behind this, it became apparent that the film never finds its own voice or identity, like Once did, despite its great cast and original music. Instead of ignoring this, Carney has focused on this misstep with Sing Street, creating a truly genuine ode to not just the seventies and all coming-of-age youth, but his own personal experience. There is a deliberate personal touch here, and the film is all the better for it - it is present in the relatable character of Cosmo (played by the impressive Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and his hormone- infused ambitions to simply ""get the girl"". Instigated by the presence of the beautiful and mysterious Raphina (played by the lovely Lucy Boynton), Cosmo starts a band. He is guided by his older brother Brendan (played by the excellent Jack Reynor) and his rebellious 80′s taste in music, to inspire his own band's music. What follows is a musically-charged narrative of experiments in identity, rebelling against oppression and hilarious attempts at parodying classic 80′s music videos. You have to wonder how interesting a character Carney must have been at that age, growing up in conservative Dublin and gaining a taste in new music that opened up his world, like his character Cosmo. Frieda Walsh-Peelo does a fine job, although not leading man quality yet, he carries the film considerably well for his first acting role. More impressive, is his vocal talent. Frieda is a trained opera singer and musician at only 16. His broad vocal range is apparent and works really well with the many different songs in the film. It will be exciting to see what other projects he tackles in the future. Lucy Boynton is stunning and so believable as the sure-footed and mysterious Raphina - she really wears the eighties wardrobe well as she fully embodies this role, rather than the other way around. Early on, her character is saved from Manic-Pixie-Dreamgirl syndrome and she becomes a real, imperfect, three-dimensional character. Boynton's light, airy voice lends to her character's naiveness, which is a stark contrast to the image she projects. Perhaps the most enjoyable character (aside from the underused band members, who do deserve some more love) is Cosmo's older brother Brendan, played by Jack Reynor. Reynor manages to make Brendan into both a reckless, failed dreamer as well as the older brother we all wish we had. By the end of this film you'll empathize with him even more and that's not just because it's written well. The only concern will be that most notably, at the TIFF Next Wave film festival, it was acknowledged during the Q&A's how approximately 90% of the audience were 50 or older. The soundtrack, if marketed correctly, could become a hit. Tunes like ""Rhythm of the Model"" and ""Drive it Like You Stole It"" were clearly audience favourites. It will be interesting to see how this will be marketed though. The music, although catchy and fun, is not ""mainstream"" and younger audiences may not bite. Older audiences who come for shoutouts to Duran Duran and The Cure may be put off by how toned down and slightly unrealistic or easy the plot plays out. There seems to be some confusion with this film, if it was made for adolescents or older audiences or just John Carney. I would have to agree with all three. I found Sing Street similar to a Pixar film in that it's marketed toward the younger set with a story that doesn't get too ugly but is pulled off well with a strong message. References that only adults will get will go over kids' heads. But ultimately - this is a movie for and by John Carney. And that is why is it so unlike Begin Again - Sing Street has it's own voice and identity. Overall, the message is so clear and true in this film. The world Carney places his story in is so rich that it refuses to lack depth despite it's expected younger audience. There are relatable subplots about family and marriage, the bond between brothers, oppression in society, and the desire to achieve your dreams despite where you come from. Admittedly, there are some underused characters who still manage to naturally add charisma and charm. Perhaps a missed opportunity, but the rest of the band members fall to the wayside to make room for Cosmo and Raphina's boy- meets-girl plot. This could've easily become a completely different film about the band itself and made into an ensemble's story. However, Sing Street is much more than that - it's a personal journey through adolescence. It's about daring to dream beyond what is put in front of you. (Reviewed by : COLD KNEES)"
"Had heard so many good things about this and had really wanted to see it but it didn't come to my local world of cine so I missed out during its theatrical run and one thing or another had made me not catch up later, but I was determined to see it before the year was out as I thought it might be one of my favourite films, and I was right. I had really enjoyed Begin Again and Once was one of my favourite films when I saw it so I am a fan of director Carney's work and in this he's right back up to Once's standards. I was enjoying it from the start, helped by the 1980's setting which was when I was in senior school just like the protagonists and which the film perfectly portrays, but was not blown away. But as it progressed it just crept into my being, filling me up with its energy, heart, sole and most of all its music and the joy and exuberance of its creators. The young cast here shine, from our hero, to his bully nemesis, taking in along the way the heroes dream girl, his band of misfits, and the worlds ultimate big brother. Sure, for a group of school kids they are unrealistically good at writing and performing their various pastiches of several 80's pop styles, but the songs are incredibly catchy and the homemade videos they create for them are very funny and perfectly of the era. If you don't leave this film with a song in your heart and a smile on your face, then your dead inside."
"This is a nice film. It's a coming of age tale with heart, it's got a great soundtrack, and some pretty good performances. However, rather than telling a properly compelling story, Sing Street often feels a little too preoccupied with portraying its time period. It undoubtedly paints a picture of mid-80s pop culture very well, but that's at the expense of a genuinely engrossing story, making this seem like a little too much style over substance.Directed and written by John Carney, who also made Once (which I didn't like) and Begin Again (which I loved), Sing Street is a bit of a middling film of his. As we've seen in his other films, there's always a real passion for making music, and how it can bring people together, and that does feature once again here.Time and time again, we get some great original songs mixed with classics of the 80s, and that's one of the things that makes this an enjoyable watch. It's a toe-tapper of a film, and, particularly if you have a strong nostalgia for the time period, you'll love seeing it portrayed on screen so well.However, unlike Begin Again, which weaved that music in with an engrossing and emotional story, Sing Street suffers from a very thin story, and pretty plain characters, which means that it's never as emotionally resonant as it needs to, and clearly wants to be.There were numerous moments where the story takes a step back from the fun of making a band and singing songs, and tries to look at the various problems in the characters' lives in order to get you to connect with them more. However, seeing as none of the characters really stand out from one another, and all just feel like very generic coming-of-age movie teenagers, it was a lot harder for me to care about whatever was happening in their personal lives, which meant that any time when the film tried to be more emotional, it really fell flat.And this is where I'm going to bring in a comparison to The Commitments, which was clearly a big influence on this film. They both have great music, and they've both got a great sense of fun about them, but the major difference is the characters. In The Commitments, the varied personalities gave the film a great dynamic, and also meant that you could care about each individual person on screen, whereas in Sing Street, considering that we don't have that, it loses a huge amount of its power, and makes the majority of the story feel very thin.The characters may be thin, and that does impact on your interest, but the performances are still very good. Although they may not have so much to do, young actors including Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor and especially Lucy Boynton really do shine, and do very well to keep you entertained and engaged by what is in truth a bit of an average and generic story.Overall, I liked Sing Street. It's a pleasant, fun and musical coming-of-age movie which brilliantly portrays its time period and features some strong performances. Its story, however, feels very thin, and that means that it's never as emotionally effective or interesting as it should have been."
"The warm and idealistic yet poignantly real Sing Street—about an Irish high-school student in the 1980s who starts a band—has the power to make you nostalgic for a childhood that wasn't your own.We meet the fifteen-year-old protagonist Conor hiding in his bedroom with a guitar, as his parents argue about their financial troubles and failing marriage. When Conor must transfer to a state Catholic school in a different part of town (based on director John Carney's childhood school), viewers aren't spared the harsh first encounters with his classmates and headmaster. He is, for example, punched and threatened by a school bully and forcibly handled by the school's headmaster after a dress-code violation. These moments and others carry with them a palpable realness, devoid of melodrama or sentimentality. The film's unique realness is present in the difficult moments (the bullying and rough family situation); it is also present in the mundane and witty—from Conor's family watching early MTV music videos together, to the extensive record collection and the poster of Freud in the older brother's bedroom, to Conor's friend's unapologetic love of rabbits. It's the realness of many of the film's moments that makes its accompanying youthful idealism powerful. The film's plot-line itself is one centered around youthful hope and naiveté. Conor starts a band to impress a beautiful aspiring model who lives across the street from his school. Although she is dating an older man, Conor hopes his music and persistence will win her over. The characters' budding romance is accompanied by a soundtrack of 1980s rock and roll hits and Carney's original '80s-inspired pop tunes, sung in the film by Conor's band. Sing Street is a life-affirming story about what one can do with hope and music, but it also gives a nod to those with unrealized dreams who use music as a form of escapism. Conor's brother (a frustrated college drop-out), like the movie's viewers, rejoices in Conor's triumphs, and Carney celebrates the older brothers of the world who pave the way (sometimes at their own expense) for their younger siblings. Sing Street is a film that is both realistic and idealist, that both celebrates the glories of youth and playfully mocks them and that both nostalgically celebrates the music of the 1980s and makes viewers want to, like Conor, be a ""futurist"" who, without looking back, drives life ""like you stole it."""
"I wanted to enjoy Sing Street - what's not to love about a story of a teenage band in the era of some of the best British music? Unfortunately, the overall story disappoints, with a shambling plot, underdeveloped characters and a confusing ending. Mainly it suffers from trying to be too many things at once. Sing Street has elements of kid-vs- bully, kid-vs-bully-teacher, punk-kid-vs-society, kid-vs-parents, kid-trying-to-get-the-girl . . . And then the film surprises us almost at the end by revealing itself as more of a big-brother-mentor story. Too many threads, too many messages. It would have been much better for the subplots to remain in the sideline. That's the magic of film - some small suggestions of the parents' divorce, for example, would have set the scene fine without having to show us everything. If the story had just focused on the one journey of the kid trying to woo the girl, it would have been far more successful. It felt like there was too much unnecessary drama, and too little lighthearted musical fun. As for the characters, the main kid's motivation wasn't convincing. He suddenly decides to start a band with some people he doesn't know, just to impress the girl? And all he knows about pop music is what his brother told him the night before, which he parrots to his new-found friends. If he was a true music lover from the start, perhaps his character would have been more likable and relatable. The other characters are mere cardboard cutouts. Teenage characters can be really cool and convincing, like the hilarious gang in JJ Abram's 'Super 8', but Sing Street's teens had no personality at all. You don't even find out the love interest's name til halfway through, and although she's supposed to be mysterious, it ends up taking away from the character. The ending of Sing Street was unconvincing as well. What, these two fifteen-year-olds are just going to drive a little boat all the way from Dublin to England? This kid who never showed an interest in music at the start of the film is going to try forge a career as a singer/songwriter in London? Sorry, but it was totally unsatisfying. It should have ended with them running away into the night with the city lights behind them, just as the love interest alluded to earlier. There are some cool songs in here, except the finale song wasn't quite as awesome and climactic as some of the others. It was cool to see and recognise bands and stuff from that era, and I guess the film was entertaining. I recommend skipping the intense, uncomfortable drama and just watching the ""Riddle of the Model"" music video scene on YouTube instead."
"As charming and cute as it is dramatic and heartfelt, Sing Street does a beautiful job of touching on so many different themes whilst still keeping its musical wits about it. The film does a great service to staying true to that special era of 80's music, hitting almost every beat in genre, and doing so in way that building the characters and story. And the story and character are nothing short of perfect, in handling an emotional drama, and giving the audience funny, compelling, and relatable characters. I hate to compare it to John Carney's other great musical film, Once but he has a certain talent when it comes to writing a film around the music, and having the music tell the story in a special way. It always puts a smile on my face when a song comes together in the way they do in a John Carney movie. I highly recommend you see this movie."
"This teen musical dramedy paints the nostalgia of classic teen flicks from the 80s, and arguably the early days of teen musicals like 'Grease'. Most importantly, it is almost exactly what a teen-oriented musical piece needs to be. It is funny, it is charming, it is upbeat, and it boasts a cast of characters that are thoroughly likable; not to mention the exhilarating musical numbers that take place. Jim Carney, the man behind the dramedy 'Begin Again' is the conductor behind this project. Carney is a genius who captures the innocence of youth and the thoughtful wonders of following your dreams. Although some may consider this just your average high school musical comedy, this claim feels a bit of an understatement. In the age where the teen musical genre is long past its hay days from the late 70s and 80s, this is one of those rare flicks of the genre that really works. Set in 1985 Dublin, this follows 14-year old Conor (played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), a misunderstood high school teenager stuck in his broken home life with his bickering parents and his lazy older brother Brendan (played by Jack Reynor). Upon meeting a cute model Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), Conor forms a rock band with a group of outcasts including Eamon (played by Mark McKenna), Ngig (played by Percy Chamburuka), Larry (played by Conor Hamilton), Garry (played by Karl Rice), and Barry (played by Ian Kenny) in efforts to impress her.It is been a long time since Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' the last time Hollywood has deliver such an electrifying feel-good musical comedy like this one. This film operates with immense charm and lyrical optimism, and the musical performances by the young cast provide more than a hefty hand for fueling this film's elegant appeal. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo provides an appealing force to be reckon with his singing. Every scene the band play, his voice shines like gold. The musical numbers are far from the classic-type songs that will leave a lasting appeal for many years to come, but they are very lively and not impossible for pinning viewers with the urge to stand up and cheer. The music leaves plenty of room for alluring nostalgia of popular rock music from the 80s. When the atmosphere is not flowing with musical numbers, there is a share humor to handed from the wide cast of characters. The lead character in particular is strongly likable, along with the supporting characters he recruits into his band. One of the sparkling points to the story is the chemistry between Peelo and Lucy Boynton, a romance that while nothing necessarily remarkable, definitely fuels the groovy atmosphere. Jack Reynor who plays the lead character's older brother is quite likable as well, a character who's stuck on the sidelines of the world of adult responsibilities. This guy comes as a form of inspiration to the lead character's optimism and willingness to success.Sing Street is a heartwarming, feel-good musical comedy with an appeal that is nearly irresistible. This movie is an elegant surprise that is likely to appeal to more than just the crowd of music fanatics. Jim Carney sets out to orchestrate a sensational music-based entry, and it excels greatly here, if not breaking any grounds."
"If you're reading this I'm willing to bet that you know what this movie is about. Ireland, mid-80's, Depeche mode, awesome music, dope, the works.Sing Street manages to elicit that time frame exceptionally well and with respect for it's source material, I totally became engrossed with the music of the era and -specially- the FASHION. They actually made it look cool.But what sets this movie apart and takes the whole ""Boy meets girl and makes band"" to new heights is the HEART the movie has. I honestly haven't been so inspired, mesmerized and just in plain awe at a movie and the dreams, trials and tribulations of it's protagonist as much as with this one in AGES. Maybe EVER.Just please do yourself and me a favor: Go watch the movie right now, by whatever means possible. You won't regret it. I promise.Oh and, Drive it like you stole it. ;)"
"Amazing work. Music is a beautiful thing and this film shows an example of how it cannot be repressed or contained, how it is a tool for reforming people, and coping with situations.And art is an attractive thing. Finally, Rest in peace to Vera Nwabuwe who played Ngig's mum. I was sad to find out she's passed in real life <3"
"John Carney's ""Sing Street"" is much closer to ""The Commitments"" than it is to ""Once"" but like ""Once"" it's on a much smaller scale, (a kind of ""Bugsy Malone"" version of ""The Commitments""), but if the scale is small both its heart and its humour are pretty massive and its mostly young cast are fabulous, (and the adults aren't half bad either). You could write the plot on a pinhead, (boy meets girl, boy starts band, boy gets girl), but plot is the last thing you go to a movie like this for, There's more tonic in ""Sing Street"" than there is in a dozen pints of plain."
This is one of the most fun and genuine movies I've seen in a while. The most basic and tried concept of a guy starting a band to impress a girl is executed with such freshness and color. And when the music starts playing you will wish Sing Street was a real band. Easily one of my favorite movie bands. The acting was surprisingly good and Lucy Boynton performance was fantastic. Sing Street is an absolute gem and I promise you will feel younger by just watching it.
"When I saw your nomination for the best comedy\music movie of the year at the Golden Globes, Sing Street attracted my interest, so I decided to watch, I found a medium movie, the cast is competent, Ferdia Walsh- Peelo is an actor to stay with. Eye, Lucy Boynton, Jack Reynor, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Aidan Gillen and etc, the direction of John Carney is good, the soundtrack is excellent, the photography is very good, I liked the 1 act, the dialogues are good, there are some Very good characters in the film, but I found the pace slow, even the movie being very short, I expected more from Sing Street, plus I quite enjoyed the first act of the movie, and the cast that is very competent. Note 6.6"
"This movie reminds me how much I miss music videos from a time when all a band needed was themselves and a good looking chick. And with the exception of that syrupy ballad near the end. Sincere and heartfelt in the best ways, genuinely funny (at times), and has a great message for young people who want to find away to express the bad things going on their lives. Maybe not the most original message, but it's told well and these young actors are good at selling it (I also liked the main kid's brother very much, sort of like an Irish Chris Pratt from Parks & Rec).One odd thing... what was with that cutaway as Sing Street was practicing for the first time where the one guy's mother goes into her bedroom to use a vibrator(?) We also never see her again. I guess I should accept the mystery but... uh what?"
"John Carney now has a trilogy of these ""let's make music and fall in love"" movies. Sure, they're mostly the same, but they're all delightful. This one is probably my least favorite of the three, but it's still very enjoyable. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays Conor, a teen boy with a dissolving family, who ends up in a new school when his parents can't afford a better one. He's immediately the focus of bullying, but that doesn't matter at all when he runs into Raphina (Lucy Boynton, a born star if there ever was one). He lies to her, telling her he's in a band, so he and his friends quickly form one. This film is all about the romance, unlike the previous two films where the romance developed from the music. Yet the love of music is a strong theme in this one, too, with Conor's older brother (Jack Reynor) tutoring him passionately on the subject. And the music the band, Sing Street, ends up creating is excellent, at least if you're cool with '80s music. Carney's trilogy probably represents the last three times I felt I had to buy a soundtrack as soon as I left the theater. I'd be perfectly fine with Carney just hitting these same notes in the future, because they're lovely."
"Wonderful narrative, cinematography, and plot. Stunning visuals. A masterpiece. According to Limonoso Tech, these are the IMDb phrases that presage an Oscar nomination, and this film is worthy. 2016 is the year that John Carney surpassed Terrence Malick as our greatest living director. Carney is one of the few remaining auteurs; what can he do next? This film represents the future, a la '85, and Lucy Boynton is the next Keira Knightley. Every music video is perfect and the songs are wonderful. I like how the hero deals with a bully, saying: ""You're just material for my songs."" The ending is satisfying a la ""The Graduate."" What better reason for form a band than to impress a girl?"
"Now that the usual slew of paid shill IMDb reviews are in, it's time for the sober minded crowd who actually care about the music of the eighties, and film, to set things straight.From the moment the all knowing, witty mentor of an older brother tells our little 15 something hero and his father that Duran Duran is an artistic statement that belies criticism and is conquerable to The Beatles, I knew something would be sorely remiss here. In fact, Duran Duran seems to be the sole band of any real importance to the eighties if you fall for this ridiculous film's 'perspective'. I can even see a wry little uncomfortable smile on Simon Le Bon's face (whom I have met), as even his ego would allow that such comparisons are ludicrous. Oh yes, sorry, I get it now. He has been assured royalties from a whole new generation being sold his music as a result of this crappy teensploitation film.Where are bands such as The Clash, who after all, were voted the most important band of the eighties by Rolling Stone - despite their already breaking up by 82? It is quite obvious that his movie intentionally glosses over any of the truly revolutionary artists of the UK eighties wave, such as Elvis Costello, The Stranglers, The Pretenders, The Police, The Specials, Joy Division, and so, so many others that simply do not exist in this telling of the tale to a new generation.Perhaps these bands would be too dangerous an influence (certainlyThe Clash) to let today's teenagers in on?Okay, there is one snippet of a Clash song, and maybe a couple other decent tracks quickly used, but without mention by name of anyone of importance except... Duran Duran. Oh, and Hall & Oates do get treated to the same sort of rip off song writing created by some professional song ripper offer paid by the film producers, that are barely acceptable as music except that they are such accurate rip offs - which of course our 15 year old hero is supposed to have written with his musical cohort who okay, kind of looks like The Edge... but once again, forget U2 even being mentioned by these Irish teenagers in 1985. Hmmmm.Jokingly, they recruit a token black band member and whereas this could have been a great vehicle by which his character would develop and show them up for their stupidity... in fact he remains exactly that. A token black cast member without any real dialogue. Wow.The 'love interest' between a milky faced 15 year old and a mid twenties actress (playing a young girl) too, whose character wants to 'get into' modeling and looks more like she's almost too old for prostitution is just bewildering to me. How can anyone take it seriously? Both characters obviously have little in the way of real love for one another, but simply find each other advantageous and desirable for their own self images. Perfect brain washing for today's teens.Because yes, although compared naturally by many to The Commitments, which is a real story that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves good music, this is blatantly targeted solely at today's teenagers who will find a 15 year old boy being persecuted for wearing heavy make up to school so close to their own painful deeply significant struggles today... To any adult who was there though, and cared about it, it is a criminal whitewashing of musical history. One I submit is not without intent on the part of the film makers.The final scene is absolutely priceless though. It's as though these film makers wanted to end by showing how ridiculous the whole thing has been all along... and to think you lasted to this final absurdity of an ending."
"The movie starts with some promise: Irish boy with difficult home life in new school starts a band. This is the same story line, done with much more intelligence and verve, as the film The Commitments. The dialogue here is boring and silly, the acting amateurish, and the ending ridiculous. The music is OK, if you can believe a group of kids get together and a week later are playing original songs. Except for the lead, none of the characters has any depth. The director/writer never develops the personalities in the band or shows how they work together. The band starts because they want to make a music video, and the whole movie is like a music video: lots of staging and no believable backstory."
"I want to explain my rating system. I usually consider a 9 an A 8 a B, etc BUT adjust base off how overrated a movie is. I initially gave this a 9 but had to change it seeing the ridiculous praise.Again, I stress it's perfectly good and you should see it BUT Sing Street is really overrated. It's one of those I enjoyed but you realize flaws in retrospect.The movie is a thematic mess. It's about ""living the dream"" (and is really one the nose with it) but fails to explore it (especially since La La Land did it way better). Instead of being about him doing the band because he enjoys it, he does it entirely for Raphina completely undercutting its main theme. He is set up as a music prodigy but his brother and friend end up knowing way more and are more deserving of living the dream. Then, he intentionally stops trying in school, fails and is okay with it. This is such an insult to real musicians who go to school to learn the nature of music OR at least have SOME talent!!Possible spoiler: Then the end is even more ridiculous. He runs away with Raphina to England. It works as feel good but makes no sense: how will he pay? where will he stay? how does he plan on getting accepted anywhere with no talent? what happens when he and Raphina go through a high school break up like EVERY other high school? what will he tell his parents?This movie is a ridiculous, overrated movie that is perfectly okay.﻿"
"There have been lots of great Irish films in recent years but, in my opinion, this is not one of them. I just found it so hard to believe virtually every aspect of the story. There were some fine performances by young actors but there were also moments of strangely exaggerated emotions. If you enjoy the film I'm happy for you ... but I fail to understand!IMDb requires that reviews have at least 10 lines of text (strange) but I cannot write more about this production without giving away part of the story and without picking out the flaws in some people who may not be ready for such criticism."
"I've seen some comparisons with The Commitments for Sing Street - an Irish musical so I understand the comparisons. However, even though The Commitments had ten main characters all of them have screen time. Unlike Sing Street- only 2 members of the band are given any screen time.The other 3 members of the band are glossed over. The black member of the band is ONLY asked to join the band because of his skin colour. The other 2 brothers could have provided so much more.The main female character in the movie - I only registered her name in the second half of the film - but the songs are catchy so it's fine, right??So many underused actors/characters. It's clear the director has a close bond with his brother. It's shown between the two brothers in the movie and hat the film is dedicated to brothers - then what's the point of the sister in Sing Street? What was her name again? Racist and sexist. And a waste of talent.But catchy tunes, right?"
"So apparently Sing Street is made by the people behind ""Begin again"" and ""Once"", two films that I have thoroughly enjoyed. A running theme throughout all three seems to be its theme of depicting musicians and their 'life of struggles'. All three are small budget but packs very meaningful stories completed with beautiful scores and wonderfully performed musical pieces.Sing street depicts a story of how music and creating music is a cure to the struggles of everyday life. The idea of Irish teens moving to London and the mainland to follow a certain ideal or dream is very much reflected in the story itself. Depicting the risk taking attitude of youth. At the same time featuring the excitement of the creative process and developing a creative idea into a physical medium.I am most impressed with the performance delivered by Jack Reynor, previously know for ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" where he did not have such a major role. His depiction of a washed up high school dropout is masterfully portrayed and his character acted as such a brilliant mirror to our main character, 'the failed predecessor'. To learn this character's back story through a burst of emotions from him really made the character possess so much more depth and it is all thanks to Jack Reynor's brilliant portrayal.This film was really great, continuing the trilogy of films that followed this sort of formula yet being unique in their own ways."
"'Sing Street' is set in Dublin during the 80's, when teenager Conor, subliminally portrayed by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, is forced to change schools due to the incapability of his parents to make ends meet. Across the street from his new school, where the protagonist is challenged by the new environment from the first day on, Conor notices a mysterious girl (an outstanding Lucy Boynton). Eager to impress this mysterious girl, he makes up that he plays in a band. So Conor kinda has to start a band now.'Sing Street' is another music movie written and directed by John Carney, who has had past successes with 'Begin Again' and foremost 'Once'. This time Carney revisits his childhood and it pay off big time. It's a sweet, joyful movie about so much more than impressing the girl. First of all, the music is great. With the help of his brother Brendan, played by Jack Reynor with a knock-out performance, Conor tries to find his identity as an artist and moves like a loose cannon from one source of inspiration to another. From Duran Duran, to David Bowie, to the Cure. The songs he composes together with his band, an ensemble of misfits, is catchy, fun, very eighties, with lyrics that shape his character and serve the plot. While the musical aspect of the movie makes the movie lots of fun, there are various powerful scenes that make 'Sing Street' one of the best movies of 2016. One scene where Brendan talks to Conor about their mother, enjoying the last rays of sun of the day seems like a small, simple scene but is so very powerful and plain devastating. It are those moments of great dialogue and symbolism (and not coincidentally most of the time with Jack Reynor in them) that make this movie grow on you even days or weeks after watching it. This coming of age movie also has the typical romantic story line. The dork trying to get the hot girl is a concept used in many, maybe too many movies and has become a cliché. Here, you just don't care about the cliché because the story line is handled in such a sweet and tender way that you simply want all the clichés to play out as you expect them to, because you want to see them played out in this exact way. Walsh-Peelo and Boynton have an amazing chemistry, with great dialogue, sometimes with a philosophical character. He's only 14 years old, she's 17, but being 'happy sad' puts the oldest among us to think. The dialogue wasn't only strong between these two characters. Over the entire movie, so much is said with subtle choice of words. Nobody ever explicitly states how they feel or what happened in their lives. instead of plainly pointing out how a character feels, the dialogue guides our perception about the feelings and background of a character. This is the dialogue in its purest form. This subtle guiding of our perception is also achieved by the amazing performances of the actors. Music, trying to find your identity as a person and artist, and love are three main recurring themes through the movie. But the movie reaches another zenith when you realize it's about more than all of that. It's about the relationship between two brothers in a broken family. The relationship between Conor and Brendan is perhaps the best part of the movie, again because of strong performances by both actors, and again because of the way it was handled by John Carney. Brendan's character will be relatable for every first born of the family.Sing Street is a must see, extremely joyful, sweet and funny movie. Besides the fun, the movie hides many layers that will make the movie stick with you for a long time. Hopefully, this movie will receive the appreciation it deserves during the upcoming award season."
"It's 80's Dublin. Economy is bad and everybody is leaving for London. Conor Lawlor's parents are cutting back on costs and he's forced to attend the Christian Brothers School on Synge Street. He's picked on by school bully Barry Bray and Brother Baxter insists on black shoes. He's befriended by diminutive Darren Mulvey. He gets aspiring model Raphina to be his video vixen. Now, all he needs is a band so that he can shoot the video. His older brother has such sage advise as ""No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins."" and be ""Happy-Sad"".This is one part nostalgia, one part sweet coming-of-age, and one part family dysfunction. All three are great and they work well together. The kids are great. The songs are alright. It needs a catchy tune like Once where it sells the movie. In the end, the songs are mostly amateurish like the characters themselves. The story touches all the right spots. It is sweet and sour. Above all, one really like these characters."
"This movie is about a boy named Conor played by actor Ferdia Walsh-Peelo who's family is going through a financial struggle, and he is forced to switch schools. And one day he finds this girl, who he wants to impress so he tells her he is in a band, but he isn't, so he has to form a bad to impress the girl.This movie excels in three main ways, the acting, and by the beautiful music, some of it completely original some adapted or covered by the young kids. And thirdly, this movie brings themes to this movie that are really amazing and they are able to perfectly hit on those themes all the way through this film.There is a lot of great performances in this movie but the stand out performance in this movie is the character being the older brother character named Brendan played by Jack Reynor. His performance pushes some of the themes in this movie, and in doing that he brings a sort of depth in this movie. He and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo work so well together and it really takes there scenes to a whole other level. Jack Reynor really steals the show, and you leave this movie wanting to see more of his character. His character arc is so well written, he is such a relateable person that you will learn to love very quickly in this movie.Every performance in this movie is good, including the band itself, all the kids work so well together, and the chemistry in this movie is amazing. The music in this movie is so good, some of the best songs from a film this year, I don't normally like rock music but it is so good in this movie I sometimes listen to it, which is something I don't normally do. The themes in this movie are so well realized, this movie is so well written you can take so much from this film. In every scene it seems to connect to the theme so well.The depth in this film, is hard to explain, every scene is important, I really do recommend you watch this movie right now. It's a great coming of age film that every teenager should watch. I just discovered this movie is on Netflix so you should definitely watch it while you can! I give this movie a 9/10"
"Almost nothing happens after the first half hour. The movie have not plot, what you read in the synopsis is 90% of movie story. It's practically a sequence of video clips. This is high school musical with some 80's music. The teenagers don't drink alcohol, there's no mentions about sex or drugs...the movie is so naive and boring, just a clip or a song between almost cheesy pseudo romantic scenes. It's so unreal..the main character learn to play guitar without practice in a few weeks and he also learn how to drive a boat in the middle of the Ocean without lessons or practice. I grew up in the 80's, I play synthesizer and I love a lot of British bands from that time but this movie have nothing in common with the real eighty's."
"The film begins well, however, it seems to be lacking the Ireland- in-the-80s vibe best captured in The Commitments. The lead actors are far too well behaved to be Irish children from that era (I experienced 1980s Ireland, so I have insight). But, gradually at first, then quickly, the plot seemed to lose cohesion and continuity. I could not tell how much time had elapsed between the scenes, and I am pretty sure there were some chronological inconsistencies that I do not now recall. If you have yet to see this cinematic abomination, leave when the protagonist's love interest leaves for England, because things are about to become absolutely unbearable. I saw the flick on a date and almost abandoned her due to the unsettling waves of cringing-shamefulness coursing through my cerebellum all the way down to my socks via my spine and sciatica. Had I been there alone, I would no doubt have biffed my Coke at the screen and walked out. But I could see that my date was loving the film, needless to say, I lost all respect for her and never called her again. It seemed designed to indulge someone's weird sugar coated fantasies. Just pure cringe. The cringe peaks at the end gig, they were supposed to be a bunch of kids playing at the school disco, but there were violins and all sorts in the mix of these utterly dreadful songs that were clearly not written by teenage boys. There was that terrible scene with the headmaster, in which the plug would literally have been pulled on the band; to say nothing of that 1950s Americana scene which almost made me defecate in my trousers. And when you thought 'OK, this must be it, the credits will surely save me', it continues. There's a particularly bad scene with the older miserable brother, where he said ""you know I used to play guitar"" and his younger brother is all surprised; how could you not know that your brother - who lives in the same house as you - plays an instrument?! Even though it started OK, the fact that it became such an omni- shambles as it progressed did irreversible and retrospective damage to the entire movie. Every time I think about that film, I feel embarrassed for having sat through it. I would sooner watch Schindler's List on LSD than sit through Sing Street again"
"Fantastic Irish movie, I remember that I was in Ireland. John Carney is one of my favorite directors. His other films are also great. The movie is as great as I expected. I love his sense of music and world. I need always something like the movie young memory.I love it."
"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I rooted for the main character from the start. Really captured the angst of being a teenager and the transformation and power one can achieve through creating. Despite some sexual references, drug use and bad language, I think it is fine for all ages."
"A teenage boy in 1980's Dublin forms a band to impress a girl. His discovery of music helps him negotiate his chaotic domestic situation and the tough Catholic school he attends. A really interesting blend of well-told coming-of-age drama with music from the 80's. As our protagonist hears new styles of music, his style and the type of music he writes changes to reflect his new interests, so while he starts writing poppy tunes, he's soon writing music influenced by The Cure, Spandau Ballet and Hall & Oates. It works primarily because the songs written by director Carney are all really good and reasonable facsimiles of music from this time and place."
"I'm about 40 years older than the demographic this is aimed at, but I really like this. It's not only a love story, it is a story of love between brothers, and a love song to 80s pop music. Solid acting, pacing, sounds, writing...really not a thing to complain about here. It's your life/ Drive it like you stole it not only deserves the song awards it got, it's a great piece of advice. I like the bit at the end with the ship. It makes the ending more than a simple, sappy thing. But you're still left with a smile."
"Hoping to impress a girl, a 1980s teen starts a band and awakens a genuine passion for music beyond meeting girls in this amiable drama from Ireland. The chemistry between the protagonist and his friends feels real, the sourced song soundtrack is top notch and the band come up with several memorable 80s-style tunes of their own. The film's best aspect though is how it taps into the rising popularity of music videos in the mid-1980s with a superb analysis of Duran Duran's 'Rio' clip, plus an awesome segment in which the friends film a video clip of their own (""The Riddle of the Model"") and absolutely nail it right down to the long flowing costumes. What exists here beyond the basic story of a bunch of friends and their love of music is somewhat less interesting. There are standard bullies, nasty teachers who abuse their powers and our hero has a rather humdrum dysfunctional home life. Unremarkable as these aspects of the film may be, the film still stacks up quite well overall since the music is so often in focus. There is also a delightful portion of the film heavily influenced by the prom sequence in 'Back to the Future', and while the protagonist's strained relationship with his parents does not resonate too much, he has some great moments alone with his college dropout older brother who rues the fact that he was the first born and had to suffer their unstable home life for longer."
"""La La Lame"" is all I can say after watching this much superior music-centric film. Awards shows are popularity contests, but we already knew that. ""For brothers everywhere"". That's all I wanted to say but there is a 5-line minimum. That's all I wanted to say but there is a 5-line minimum."
"Güzel filmdi..Aşkın insana neler yaptıracagını anlatıyor. Oyunculukları da çok beğendim. Doğallardı. The movie was beautiful. The second movie can be taken. It'Il be more beautiful. I think the ""Rock Star"" movie came.I had a great desire for the second in that film. And in that movie is a cult film for me.."
"I really was not expecting to like Sing Street since I am not a fan of quirky teenage movies (I was very wrong by assuming this movie was that kind of movie). At the end of the movie I stood with satisfaction and a smile in my face.This movie has very good and well-rounded characters that give depth to the story and help you get invested in their lives. I believe that the characters are the best part of this film, I really got to understand the motivations of all the characters and a little bit of backstory.The music is great as well, every song (original and soundtrack) is really catchy and goes hand in hand with the tone of the film.Another aspect I really liked about the film was its style. The color grading in the movie is wonderful and the cinematography is very good.I could say that the pacing in the movie is kind of off, because at the beginning it moves really fast and then kind of slows by the end. In my opinion, the end has a better pace than the beginning but that is just a nitpick."
"I entered the theatre for Sing Street with little clues what it is about, and stumbled into a beautiful film work.The film delves into the human connections of Cosmo. Before addressing the most nuanced relationship with Raphina, some analytic inks should be spilled on other minor relationships. Starting with his family, Cosmo is raised in a home full of dynamics. The torn marriage of his parents accentuates itself as the film progresses. The children seem fine with it, and regard with a matter-of-fact altitude. The notion of ""happy sad"" is most clearly evident in this relationship. Long gone is the happiness of the couple. Even Cosmo's brother, Brendan, pointed out that the marriage is due to the giving birth of him as a result of thirst for sex. Yet, it is preposterous to take this as an indication of the modest amount of love that the mother and father has for each other. The image of his father sleeping on the floor so that the bed is fully his mother's conjures up a sense of affection. If this act of sacrifice is not suggestive of romance, what else is better to be? Broken is the marriage it may seem, this does not suffice to be an indicator of the lack of love. Love, hate are not a binary concept, nor are they two ends of a continuum; they exist largely independently.Cosmo's relationship with his brother is no less bewitching. A college drop-out, Brendon seems to stay in for most of the time, so as to avoid encountering with life. This point may not be so conspicuous at first, but it reveals itself in later parts. Enthusiasm fills him every time he shows Cosmo what good music is. The fruits that Cosmo acquires reminisces Brandan of his teenage years, when he was as talented and successfully. The thin but apparent line between his pathetic current state of being and his brother's propitious prospect as a reflection of his own past fuels his indignation. Although it is depicted that the source of frustration is vented on Cosmo, little does it mean to incur guilt in Cosmo, but rather in himself for neglecting the once flourishing years of his life. Other minor characters develop intriguing relationships with Cosmo. Eamon forms a close friendship with Cosmo: they work together to make music. Eamon also necessarily enables Cosmo to translate his music ideas into tangible notes and compositions. His willingness to help, even when Cosmo out of nowhere crash by at night, highlights the beauty of such a friendship. The bully Barry at first appears an intimidation, then docile towards Cosmo's confidence, and eventually deferential as he works for his band. Brother Baxter is an embodiment of suppression, or more precisely, the conventional and conservative school of thoughts that resist change. He is essential as an avenue to accentuate Cosmo's expression of self-identity.The key character, besides the protagonist, is of course Raphina. She governs most of Cosmo's thoughts and therefore his actions. Cosmo's decision to form a band is a response to his encounter with Raphina. His songs revolve much around Raphina. His wish to impress her is the main determinant of his writing process.There are several vivid images in this film that I adore. One of those is the scene of his mother immersed herself in the few last sunlight on the threshold of the house, cherishing a glass of alcohol reading newspaper. The poetic imagery brings home the notion of appreciating the trivial elements of life that may seem insignificant but in fact instrumental in the fulfilment of life.I find myself catapulted into thoughts for the very last scene. Cosmo and Raphina venture out to the vast water to reach Britain. Inordinate amounts of uncertainty is in direct contrast with their jubilance to arrive in Britain. They are met by heavy waves and a drizzle, which are open to various interpretations. At first, the thought of them failing and returning back to Dublin crossed my mind. However, I tried my best to put my imagination at work, and then made a correlation with a line said by Cosmo earlier, about after a rain the continent where Britain is situated will appear crystal clear to people on the pier. This provides enough evidence to make a plausible interpretation that eventually their aspirations will be realised, despite the adversity that they may face.Overall, I'm rather impressed by the film. The time I spent for it was truly worthwhile, for this piece of art is what makes film so a powerful medium."
"If you only hear about John Carney's ""Sing Street"" you might think that it has the same story as ""The Commitments"". They do have similar plots but go in their own directions. This one incorporates the theme of the bullied kid. In this case, a boy gets moved to a new school in 1980s Dublin and starts a band. The movie at once serves as a coming-of-age story and also a look at its era. The mom mentions that Ireland doesn't allow divorce (it now does).I thought that the most impressive scene was the ""Back to the Future"" sequence, where the principal dances (naturally it turns out to be in the boy's imagination). When you look at the kind of school that this is - and what a jerk the principal is - it's understandable why he and his friends decide to start a band. There has to be a way for people to unleash their creativity, especially under these circumstances.Basically, this movie is worth seeing. I now want to see Carney's earlier ""Once"", which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song (most people probably didn't expect it to win since Disney's ""Enchanted"" was also nominated in that category).I recommend it."
"This film tells the story of a young man in a troubled family, whose parents are breaking up. He is bullied in school and basically is a nobody, until he decides to form a band to attract a mysterious orphan girl.""Sing Street"" is a low budget film, with no fancy sets and no fancy clothes. However, it has this mysterious aura around it, and I like it a lot. The main character, Conor, is a very likable youngster, and I particularly feel for him because of his experience in school with the bullies and the headmaster. His friends are all very realistic and down to earth. The whole film breathes of positivity, as it tells a tale of chasing dreams, breaking out of the comfort zone and living the life you want. Maybe that's what attracts me to the film. And of course, the very nice songs that the band performs also make me like the film loads. It is unusual that I like the songs in a film about music, but in this film I find myself singing along to that song ""Drive it Like You Stole It"". I enjoyed watching ""Sing Street""."
"Taking place in Dublin in 1985, this is an absolutely brilliant coming of age film which is at turns hilarious, life-affirming and thought-provoking. It has a superb script by John Carney which hits all of the right notes and his direction is certainly up to the task. The film has an excellent soundtrack featuring various styles of music from the period such as the Cure, the Clash, A-ha, Duran Duran, the Jam, Spandau Ballet and Joe Jackson as well as original compositions written by Carney, Gary Clark, Glen Hansard and others. However, in spite of the fact that it was likewise written for the film, ""Go Now"" by Adam Levine seemed like a somewhat awkward fit as it sounded more 2010s than 1980s. The film paints a convincing portrait of dysfunctional families, some of which are considerably more dysfunctional than others. It perfectly captures the essence of 1980s Ireland, which was not exactly a land of opportunity. Actually, Ireland has never been a land of opportunity.The film stars Ferdia Walsh-Peelo in a very good performance as Conor Lalor, a 15-year-old boy who is pulled out of his posh, fee paying Jesuit run school (presumably either Belvedere or Gonzaga) and forced to attend the rough innercity school Synge Street CBS due to the fact that his family is having serious financial problems. Walsh-Peelo is very impressive in his first film role, let alone his first leading role, but he is an even better musician. Incidentally, his elder brother Tadhg was in my year in law at UCD. I don't recall ever actually speaking to him but he always seemed like a nice guy. As Conor's parents Robert and Penny's marriage is rapidly deteriorating, his home life is far from ideal. He finds comfort in his love of music. Considering that his new school has a very different atmosphere from his old one, it is not a smooth transition. In his first week, he is targeted by both the school bully Barry Bray and the sadistic headmaster Brother Baxter, who objects to the fact that he is wearing brown shoes in contravention of the strict black shoe policy. After he meets a 16-year-old model named Raphina, Conor tells her that he just so happens to be looking for a model to be in his band's first music video. The only problem is that he does not really have a band. Thankfully, Conor has made his first friend at the school in the form of a budding entrepreneur named Darren Mulvey, who agrees to manage the band and introduces him to the eccentric rabbit enthusiast Eamon who can reportedly ""play every instrument known to mankind.""Lucy Boynton is extremely strong as Raphina, a seemingly strong, confident girl who uses her air of mystery and sophistication to mask her vulnerability and inner pain. The band's first original song ""The Riddle of the Model"" concerns the perception that people become less interesting the more that you learn about them as anything is initially possible (at least in your head). However, Raphina becomes more and more interesting as we learn more about her. She is without a doubt the film's strongest and most memorable character. Raphina dreams of moving to London to start her career as a model, in large part because she desperately wants to escape her often traumatic life in Ireland. Her mother is a manic depressive who is in and out of hospital while her father, a drunkard, was killed in a car accident a few years earlier. In the film's most heart-breaking, gut-wrenching moment, Raphina tells Conor – albeit not in so many words – that her father sexually abused her. As a result, he gains a new insight into not only Raphina but his own situation as he realises that his home life is nowhere near as bad as it could be. In comparison to many other teen films, Conor and Raphina's relationship is unusual in that it never goes beyond kissing. In that sense, it is very pure and sweet and, as such, it serves as an effective contrast to Raphina's serious personal problems. I think that Conor means so much to Raphina in part because he is one of the few people in her life who has not taken advantage of her, one way or another.Conor's extremely close relationship with his elder brother Brendan, played very well by Jack Reynor, is just as important to the storyline as his relationship with Raphina. Brendan offers a great deal of valuable advice on both musical and romantic matters. A college dropout, he initially appears to be the stereotypical Generation X stoner and pop philosopher but Carney expertly deconstructs the stereotype by revealing that he regrets his wasted potential. As much as he loves Conor, he is clearly envious of him to some degree as he is the golden boy in the family but he eventually gets over it. Ben Carolan is an absolute laugh riot as Darren, who gets all of the funniest lines and delivers them impeccably. There is an inspired comic moment when he suggests getting Ngig, the school's sole black student, to join the band for the sole reason that it would look cool to have a black guy in the line-up. Mark McKenna is very good as Eamon, Conor's writing partner who becomes his best friend. Aidan Gillen, the best known actor in the film in or out of Ireland, and Maria Doyle Kennedy are excellent as Conor's parents Robert and Penny. The same is true of Don Wycherly as the film's main antagonist Brother Baxter, who physically assaults Conor in a very powerful scene. Ian Kenny is perfectly cast as Barry who, like Raphina, Brendan and Penny, is a far more complicated character than he appears at first glance.Overall, this is an excellent film which is just as effective in its character development as in its treatment of music."
"John Carney was surely someone who I very much looked forward to after creating the indie gem Once. Begin Again was solid, but a little inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. This is much more like it. Boasting a coming-of-age drama as well as a music film, he unleashes some really memorable and likable characters that carry us through this charming, sweet film. I don't think it does anything too extraordinary, and the music isn't to the same level as the music from Once (few music is) but it's really good and entertaining, not to mention very emotionally- investing. That final scene is also really magical and beautiful and surely to resonate with a lot."
"""Maybe you're living in my world. I'm not living in yours. You're just material for my songs."" Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) By all measures Sing Street is just another teen-band birth in the style of the second British invasion. Difficult love, broken homes, and rebellion are plentiful. However it's not just another cliché because the sentiment is real and the tone light to make a thoroughly enjoyable musical from the pen of writer-director John Carney. His Once set the standard for reasonable romance coming from the street into our hearts.In 1985, fifteen-year old Cosmo (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) switches to a Christian Brothers school because his current Jesuit school is too expensive. The ensuing chaos comes out of his posh look and a disciplinarian Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley), who bans Cosmo's brown shoes (all students are supposed to wear black). The universal truth, however, is that music will transform Cosmo's band, formed to catch fetching, Raphina (Lucy Boynton), by inviting her to act in a video for a band he has yet to form.The feckless parents and the usual bully who changes to good guy make appearances, as do the dorky but lovable band members, a motley crew to be sure. Their diversity, from diminutive dweeb to cool black keyboardist, Ngig (Percy Chamburuka), is enchanting; the creation of songs is gently witnessed, not always an element of any musical history, fact or fiction.Arguably the most endearing relationship of Cosmo's life is with his brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who could be Seth Rogan's brother. Brendan is a free spirit who has lost his chance to make it in music but has endless patience with his young brother in providing him the wisdom and means to break loose. His sincere love for his brother is a touchingly true part of an otherwise romantic dream.Mostly the musical emphasizes the mandate for talent to will its way to success, despite the counter-circumstances that keep him home and quiet his talent. London is, as usual, the promised land, even for kids from Dublin, and several times in this romance eyes look across the sea to that great island with its transforming city.Sing Street is a formula and a most enjoyable one. Filmmaker Carney will bring a tear to your eye as the young'uns break from the imprisoning world of broken homes and repressive schools to play the music of freedom.Often cited in Sing Street, ""finding happiness in sadness,"" is a mantra worthy of this musical. I'm not arguing with that cliché because I had too much fun watching it play out."
"I saw Once (Carney's first major film) about a year ago. I immediately purchased Begin Again and Sing Street from Amazon after completing it. I watched Begin Again about 2 days after it arrived. And I loved that film as well. But I delayed watching Sing Street for as long as I could. The reason was simple you can only watch a film for the first time once and I didn't want to rush seeing this man's work. I finally gave in and watched Sing Street last night. I am glad I waited and glad I gave in. Like Once and Begin Again, Sing Street is a brilliant film that fits comfortably within the musical genre while being atypical low-key and intimate.Sing Street is a classic boy meets girl tale centered in Dublin in the mid-80's. A young artistic teenage struggle to find his voice while trying to woo a slightly older girl; their budding love is contrasted with the humanly dysfunctional home life of both and the strife of being in school. It has all the major story beats you expect. There is a bully character. There is a sequence of the straight-laced elders not understanding the teens artistic expression. The older libertine brother of the teen is a voice of wisdom and of warning. Carney's script, much like Begin Again being a reworked A Star is Born, conforms to the coming of age tale. What sets it apart is the details. It contains every story beat one would desire. It is has personal (it is clearly inspired by Carney's life) authentic vibe to it that makes the tropes real again.But the glory of this film is the direction. The handheld quasi-documentary camera work-especially in the musical scenes-strips the artifice from the story and it truly makes you feel connected to these characters. The movie feels utterly real especially in the precise nature of the teen's naïve attempts to be creative. The direction is beguiling in how it makes spectacle out of intimacy. The film contains a very inventive camera pan that works as a time jump cut, it also has a in narrative fantasy sequence for one of its songs. It somehow manages to keep the film very close and low key but also bold and striking in its grandeur in both sequences. It turns the musical form back onto itself and completes the re-invention of the form started in Once.The music is, of course, wonderful. It is by the same composer as much of the music from Once. It has the same raw but poignant energy to it. More than that it feels as if the characters are creating it. It has the youthful quality it should. It is good but unpolished. The simple elegance you would expect from a gifted teenage.I adore this film so much."
"I have to be honest, I only decided to watch this film because of the actress Lucy Boynton, who I really like, and I had no expectations whatsoever. The first 10 minutes felt like an ordinary british film, and my only motivation was to wait for Boynton to appear in the screen. But quickly, she was not the only element that made me want to watch the whole thing.
Suddenly, I realized that the film was not about music (specifically), it was about dreams and friends.
Halfway through it, I was really deepened, and in love with all the characters.
Just watch it, it's a good way to spend your night and will learn something from it."
It's just beautiful and as a wanna be rockstar in his twenties the resonance squeezed the heart. Great characters and a genuine love story
I'm 48 and love music. I love this movie! Took me back to the perfect 80's.
"Very kind and entertaining movie. I like such kind movies, what you can believe and enjoy. Of course, I understand the hard situation of the main characters, but it is very well-served, the script is well-written, funny. The characters are loveable. (I especially liked the older brother! :) )."
"Like previous reviewers I genuinely wasn't expecting much- but what a wonderful fairy tale with a superb message.
I'm 48, so would have been the exact age of the characters back in the 80's - and I was also in my first band - so nostalgia is playing a big part in my review. But I believe that anyone from any era could watch this and have nothing but praise. It's simple, understated even, but with a fantastic original soundtrack, cast and script that left me both laughing and crying at the same time- in the best way possible.
While Feargal Sharkey wrote about Teenage Kicks- with all its hopes and dreams, this film displays it in a way that will encourage you to never waste a precious moment - as anything is possible. Enjoy!"
"I've watched SingStreet a number of times.. As someone who likes 80s flicks and 80s tunes this is what nostalgia is all about.
A story that not makes you think that what is life without a little risk in tough times but how important it is to be yourself ( a little cheesy) great acting throughout with nice good laugh at so many Irishism's throughout.
Sing street is a classic. Check it out. I know you'll dig it."
"This film works in so many levels, but I will stick to the music: Sing Street explores the musical genres of the 80s and 90s and brilliantly combines them together. The band's first song is written in the New Romantics style as a reference to Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, ""Beautiful Sea"" is a nod at The Cure (Cosmo even stands and plays guitar like Robert Smith) and ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" combines the rhythm of Hall and Oates' ""Maneater"" with Joe Jackson's chords from the ""Stepping Out"" era. ""Brown Shoes"" is more like a 90s song with the distorted guitars. Brilliant job of the musical director!"
"My favourite movie of all time, when I first watched it I didn't speak for an hour afterwards.this movie introduced so much great music into my life. I wanted to call my baby brother 'cosmo'. the way family was portrayed in this movie hit home a lot, I could relate to the older brother character, being the oldest myself. the constant fighting of the parents at home, the breakup. I could connect with the feeling 'I got to get out of Ireland if I ever want to get anywhere with my dreams'.I will always come back to this movie, it means a lot to me. Plus it's so much fun to watch man, the music and the band I just want to be in the band with them! you feel like you are during the movie. the school of rock was a major reason I took up guitar, this movie makes me want to keep playing.
WATCH IT MAN. THANK YOU FOR THIS MOVIE."
"Love this!! It's like an updated Commitments. Slightly less grimy, but still with enough miserable reality to tick that box. It's a lot more hopeful though and sweet. Actually it's not really like The Commitments at all. The Commitments is not sweet. While that film smacks of hope, what's on screen is brutal, dirty and real. Sing Street is a different beast. It's romantic and full of youthful abandon, great music and three fantastic characters in Ferdio Walsh-Peelo (awesome name), Lucy Boynton and the scene stealing Jack Reynor. I defy anyone with a heart to watch this and not gasp, smile and want to punch the air. Fantastic stuff."
"I had forgotten how utterly full of joy and hope Sing Street is, about a teenager growing up in 80s working class Dublin who refuses to simply lie down and accept the cards that have been dealt to him. That this revelatory journey begins with a casual fib to try and impress a pretty girl is apt; Cosmo falls into the juvenile trap of pretending to be someone else for another, but we marvel as he climbs out of that trap and comes of age in the process. The film has touches of the usual kitchen-sink realism, but avoids the pitfalls of completely swooping down to that gloomy level. Cosmo finds his own solace, slamming the door on his parent's screaming and returning to strumming his acoustic guitar. They're so poor he can't even afford a new pair of black school shoes, but sports winged lashes and rebellious streaks in his hair. Editors Andrew Marcus and Julian Ulrichs make heartbreak and highlights out of the way he retreats into musical daydream, alternating close-ups of Conor's twitching face and an unmoving set of doors before seamlessly shifting into a full blown dream sequence. That 'dress rehearsal' of their smash hit ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" speaks to Sing Street at its best: loud, brash, and bold, with songs that serenade a life at its breaking point. The scene features an eye-popping colour scheme, sitcom-esque high key lighting, and a wacky ensemble of characters emerging from the crowd in even wackier costumes. If only life were like this. But the boys and their band make their own magic, evolving from a rag-tag bunch in a makeshift setup next to a back alley dumpster. Their music is their bond and their escape; for Cosmo an avenue to splatter his heartache onto notation (even as it is too late for his college-dropout older brother, who reveals his own obscured failings in a startling monologue), for schoolyard bully Barry a chance to escape his abusive, dead-end household. Cosmo sets his heart on Lucy Boynton's Raphina, a model with an elven elegance about her, and a wardrobe that sees her walk straight off a magazine cover. The relationship is so unbalanced it's almost unfair; Cosmo has already fallen in love before their first conversation, while Raphina's juggling another pretty boy - no, man - on the side. In a classic move, he projects a whole range of fantasies and ideals onto the model, making her the centre of his attention and first music video. Yet John Carney unravels this fairy tale with such finesse, stripping away the mystique from a girl who is in reality only a year older than Conor, and a lot less worldlier than he really thinks. Only then can they be true to themselves, and then each other. I'm still not as captivated by the ending as I was by the finale of Carney's 2007 masterpiece Once, which seemed to stick truer to the characters. Sometimes romance and real life are at odds with each other, and it takes strength to admit it. What Cosmo and Raphina set off to achieve isn't entirely implausible, but it's brave, far braver than anything else they have aspired to in their short lives (Carney shoots it almost like the prom sequence, the boundary between fantasy and reality hazy). But they're futurists, after all. Nostalgia and cover bands are a thing of the past, for those still sulking around in Dublin. Their time is now. Grab the wheel and own it."
"Best Music Movie i've ever seen. Good acting, great characters and of course lovely music :)"
"It's criminal how underrated this film is! All the songs are great, and the storyline was so in tune with reality. I went in to see another teen movie about the struggles of reaching your dream, but I got so much more. Life in a broken home, blind devotion, repairing friendships, it was all so beautifully done and all seemed really smooth.I can understand that certain elements of the film may not make it suitable for worldwide distribution (the romance between two minors is prime example), but damn. This is criminally underrated, and arguably more enjoyable than the other musical film that stole 2016."
Just caught this on Netflix. What a surprise! Great movie with catchy music. Reminded me of being in Dublin as a teen in the early 80s. So cute.
