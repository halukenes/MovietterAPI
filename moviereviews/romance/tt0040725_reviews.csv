"Art as vocation; art as religion; art as the purpose of life: The Archers team of Powell and Pressburger aimed high with 'The Red Shoes' - and scored a bull's-eye. The film is a feast for the senses: cinematography (by Archers regular Jack Cardiff), music, acting and ballet are combined to make a magnificent whole. Emeric Pressburger's story appears simple at first glance, but is a challenging study of the value and purpose of art, and of aestheticism as a creed (a term not used lightly). It is given life by some of the most talented dancers of the era: Leonid Myasin/Massine as lovable Grisha; Ludmilla Tchérina as glamorous, flighty Irina; Robert Helpmann - who choreographed the title ballet - as Ivan; Marie Rambert as herself, and Moira Shearer (Ashton's 'Cinderella') highly appealing as the heroine Vicky. The non-dancing cast is led by Archers regulars Anton Walbrook (magnificent - why no Oscar?) and Marius Goring (so convincing I ended up wanting to slap him).The plot combines Andersen's fable, 'The Red Shoes' with elements of Dyagilev's relationships with Nizhinskii and Myasin, and the effect of the younger men's marriages. Dancer Vicky Page (Shearer) and composer Julian Craster (Goring) are taken up and encouraged by ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Walbrook). Boris is the film's dominant character, an obvious portrait of Sergei Pavlovich Dyagilev (1872-1929), one of 20C culture's greatest figures, the driving force of 'Mir Iskusstva' and the 'Ballets Russes'. However, his Scots-Russian surname alludes to Mikhail Yur'evich Lermontov (1814-41), poet and author of 'A Hero of Our Time', Pushkin's successor as the voice of Russian Romanticism. Boris is an aesthete and perfectionist, a true believer in the religion of art. All his passions and energies are channelled into bringing out the best in the company that is his 'family'. He demands equal dedication from his protégés. He believes that if you have an outstanding talent, your primary duty is to give that talent its fullest expression, not fritter it away through mundane distractions and dalliances. Human relationships are transitory: what matters is the art. It is a stern, unsentimental creed, but a noble one.Vicky and Julian begin an affair during the creation of the new ballet, 'The Red Shoes' (which we see in full, and has, in its sacrificial death-by-dancing, echoes of Stravinskii's 'Sacre du Printemps', choreographed by Nizhinskii for Dyagilev). Their love tests their commitment to Lermontov's ethic. What makes the conflict interesting and effective is that it is not trivialised as sexual rivalry: Boris is discreetly signalled as gay, like Dyagilev - something reinforced by the casting of Walbrook. (It is unnecessary to highlight the courage, in 1948, of placing centre-stage a dignified, powerful, non-caricatured gay character, played by a gay actor who had escaped Nazi persecution.) The struggle is between real Romanticism - hence Boris's sharing his name with the Byronic poet - and mere 'romance'. But the brutal climax, bringing together Andersen's story with suitably Russian overtones of 'Anna Karenina', is an evasion of decision: a character choosing death rather than commitment one way or the other. The final scene combines tragic lyricism with awareness of the unnecessary waste: and the dance, of course, goes on.My understanding of and relationship with 'The Red Shoes' has changed and deepened with time. In girlhood, I was inclined to be relatively indulgent to Vicky and Julian. In middle age, they seem plain self-indulgent. Julian, frankly, isn't worth any sacrifice. Ballet is a ""second-rate form of expression"", he says in a quarrel with Boris - who, of course, launched his career. (If Boris had punched *him* instead of the mirror, how I'd have cheered!) He regards Vicky as a muse for his own fulfilment as a composer, while she frets with frustration, her pointe shoes in a drawer, her own artistic fulfilment denied. Their separate beds after marriage seem a revealing insight, not merely '40s film censorship. On the spectrum of fictional obnoxiousness, Julian's not far behind Angel Clare in 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles'. Boris's manipulations are actually *less* selfish - directed towards enabling Vicky to express *her* creativity to the maximum - not bury her talent in a drawer.Yes - Boris's passionately held vocation and values now evoke my strongest sympathies and recognition/identification as a fellow 'true believer' in art (and long-time Dyagilev-ite). Young sentimentalists may hate him (he knows ""adolescent nonsense"" when he hears it!), but he speaks hard truths and much wisdom. Personal relationships are fragile; a dancer's active career can be short. If you have a gift, service to it must come first: it is a sacred duty. Domesticity can wait. Yes, he is autocratic, temperamental: prophets and visionaries usually are. And what is his job? To unite other exceptionally gifted people from diverse disciplines - painting, costume, music, dance - with *their* competing egos and artistic temperaments, to create the multifaceted art of ballet. Herding cats is easier! And yet he is capable of generosity and forgiveness, as with the prodigal Irina. A complex, moving, genuinely heroic figure, 'The Red Shoes' is more his film than Vicky and Julian's.But what went wrong with British film? The Archers made 'The Red Shoes' in 1948; now we have vacuous romantic-comedy/chick-flick pap or drab kitchen-sinkers that might as well be TV soap episodes, betokening a loss of cultural and intellectual confidence. (In visual flair, has The Archers' torch passed to Baz Luhrmann? Time will tell!) The present cultural climate treats the arts as an optional add-on to civilisation, rather than a defining part of what it means to be civilised. The arts are constantly called upon to justify their existence in commercial or social engineering terms, not for their intrinsic worth. A film, then, in which the most compelling character advocates Art for Art's Sake - art as a sacred calling - flings a gauntlet in the face of a market-driven, anti-intellectual, anti-beauty, utilitarian society. Sergei Pavlovich/Boris Lermontov, where are you now we need you?!!!"
"I am biased because I have loved this film ever since I was four years old. Some films, as you grow and age, lose their magic and you forget what made you love it as a child. This film has only strengthened my love and appreciation of it as I have grown older. I am not one to narrate a storyline, as this film is great for more than, and even despite, it's story.The beautiful colour photography of the locations, including London, Paris and Monte Carlo, will take you back to a fictional glamorous 1940's where everyone wore chic clothes and were perfectly mannered and groomed and make you wish you could visit there sometime.The music is a highlight for me. Brian Easdale has written such a detailed and nuanced lyrical score that does not overpower any moment in the film. There are moments where the music so perfectly conveys a character's very thought, even though they are not saying a word and their face betrays not a hint of emotion.The story is a familiar one, particularly today, of ambition and the balance between career and personal life, between a creative passion and a human one. And of course, yes there is the ballet element. I have no interest in ballet and I love the film. It does play up the prima ballerinas and haughty choreographer stereotypes, but as they are played by real ballet dancers, I think it makes it all the funnier. Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine are particularly hilarious and over the top, so full of pathos and themselves.Anton Walbrook is the star of this film, playing a Diaghilev type character and absolutely dominates any scene he is in. He is not bombastic in a showy, hammy way. It is a more silent but deadly charismatic performance. It is a pity he did not receive an award for it. He is stern, uncompromising, cold and passionate and absolutely deadly. He is a gentleman tough guy.Moira Shearer and Marius Goring, unfortunately do not fare so well in comparison, but they are perfectly adequate in their roles and have some touching and funny moments. It is not altogether their fault, the characters are a little bland, especially in comparison to all the other larger than life characters they are paired with. Shearer really comes good as soon as she starts dancing.Which brings me to the fifteen minute ballet in the middle of the film. It is beautiful (and brief). The dancing is fabulous, it looks beautiful and the music is amazing. No one should fast forward this masterpiece of filmed ballet. It is cinematic, not (as filmed ballet usually is) procenium stage bound. It is a modern ballet, choreographed by Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine and is a story, perhaps even a mirror, within and of the film.The Red Shoes combines every one of it's elements into a perfect whole. Some elements are a bit lacking, the story is very simple and given another context a bit soap opera like, but combined with the visuals, the music, the characters and the human comedy-tragedy, it is a beautiful complete film and one that will keep improving with age.10/10"
"The performances are terrific (with only the odd unusual line delivery, partly due to english being many of the actors' second language, and partly due to the fact that all of the main dancing characters, are not professional actors at all, but dancers - including Moira Shearer, Australia's Robert Helpmann, Leonida Massine and Ludmilla Tcherina - which fact considering, they do marvellous jobs).The story's passion for ballet and music comes across to the audience, and the story is compelling and fascinating, due to the way it is told. Moira Shearer, in a career-defining role, has a wonderful presence as the young dancer Victoria Page, who becomes a star of the Lermontov Ballet Company, and dances the lead in the ballet The Red Shoes. But Anton Walbrook is truly terrific as Lemontov. One particular moment i was very impressed with was when he begins to write a letter to Victoria, and there is a closeup of his face, and on his face we can read the emotions of his letter in a very subtle way. A marvellous scene. He has a germanic cold stare in this part which really brings it to life - the character of Lemontov is entirely in his eyes.The score is fantastic, particularly the original ballet of the red shoes itself, composed for the film by Brian Easdale. The film has such a wonderful look partly due to the fact that its production designer was a painter, Hein Heckroth.But the element which really makes this movie great is how superbly it is directed. With glorious use of colour, it is directed in a smooth, impeccable style in the manner of Renoir - except here each frame poses not as a painting, but as a moment from a ballet.A wonderful film to watch."
"I first heard of ""The Red Shoes"" when I read the liner notes to an album by the jazz/fusion group Weather Report, called ""Tale Spinnin'"". Therein it said that saxophonist Wayne Shorter had seen the film a few dozen times. Intrigued, I watched it when I noticed it in the TV listings. What a discovery!With its focus on the tangle of lives of a ballerina, a composer, and a dictatorial impresario who uses them both, the story may have elements of a soap opera, but it's a superior soap opera. What appealed to Shorter, I'm sure, is the film's depiction of the artists' creative process. It may have been done better elsewhere, but I haven't seen it. Besides that, it's beautifully directed, beautifully photographed and sumptuous to look at throughout. The surreal title ballet is performed in a segment that is stunning, and I'm not just using that word as a cliche.Anton Walbrook stands out as Lermontov, leader of the ballet troupe. There are many real-life artists from the ballet world in the film, including Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Massine is particularly effective.Don't be put off by the notion that this is some effete art film; it's high quality AND accessible. Anyone who enjoys art (especially ballet), romance or just plain good moviemaking owes it to themselves to see it."
"The film isn't THAT closely related to Hans Christian Andersen's story; but it would be a good idea to read the story before seeing the film.  It's one of Andersen's better stories, anyway.Another minor note: if no other consideration will sway you, see `The Red Shoes' for a perceptive look the position of the ballet composer relative to that of the dancers.  For Powell and Pressburger it's no more than a diverting side issue, but it's one of the things that especially interested me.  If you look at advertisements for ballet productions today, you'll notice that the composer's name is NEVER printed - even if the ballet is called `Cinderella' and the public has no way of working out whose score is being used.  It puts the composer in his place, no doubt.  Yet musicians at the ballet are in the habit of thinking that they're the most important people there.I'm on their side.  I happen to loathe classical ballet as such.  `Swan Lake' strikes me as a lovely score disfigured by people who insist on dancing to it.  Yet `The Red Shoes' makes me put all of this aside.  Indeed, it would be fair to say that I simply CAN'T dislike ballet while watching the film - which is especially odd, considering some of the things it does to people.So, yes, if `The Red Shoes' can have this effect on ME, of all people, it's surely one of the best films ever made.  I can't agree at all with the people who describe the film as `melodrama' or `camp'.  (The latter charge I scarcely even understand.)  The story is what it is and it's told at the most realistic and sincere level appropriate.  The characters who act theatrically (NOT melodramatically) are all creatures of the theatre, and have not spent not just their days but their lives in Lermontov's troupe. If you want a more understated view of things then watch the musicians.  To put in a word for one of them, Brian Easdale's source music is superb: GOOD music of a kind that an English composer like Craster might well be expected to write.  It's clear that Easdale wrote Craster's compositions first, and then constructed the rest of the score around them, rather than vice versa."
"I have seen this film about 30 times in 30 years and for me this film will always be special. Astonishingly, my wife, who is a Ballet Teacher, doesn't care at all for this film finding it too 'affected'. Perhaps as I am not involved with ballet at a professional level is a reason why I can enjoy this vibrant, colourful fantasy so much, but then our ballet friends adore the film, so who knows why this film affects some so profoundly (Spielberg&Scorsese!!) and not others. Anton Walbrook's authoritative performance is so memorable and Moira Shearer dances beautifully. Perhaps because the film is so highly charged with passion and emotion it will never please everyone, but I feel this is one of the great achievements of British Cinema and a film so rich and inspirational you will never wish to forget it."
"We saw this film years ago. It was a surprise when it was included as part of a Michael Powell's work at the Walter Reade recently. The film still has a great look as it seems it has been lovingly restored. Mr. Powell, working with his usual collaborator, Emeric Pressburger, created a film about the world of ballet that has proved to be, not only a timeless classic, but a crowd pleaser to those who watch it for the first time.""The Red Shoes"" is basically a fairy tale loosely based on a Hans Christian Andersen story. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Pressburger gave it a vivid look that even today, appears fresh and glamorous. Those glorious colors in the film stays in the mind of the viewer forever.The ballets shown are magnificently staged. The Red Shoes ballet by Sir Robert Helpmann and The Shoemaker by Leonide Massine, a giant in the world of ballet. The music conducted flawlessly by Sir Thomas Beecham lingers in one's mind long after the movie is over. The glorious Technicolor cinematography by Jack Cardiff is amazing.The acting by Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring and Moira Shearer serves the story well, although the director got better performances in later films, ""Peeping Tom"" and ""Black Narcisus"", to name two. Ms. Shearer with her red hair and peaches and cream skin projects such a refined presence in the film that is hard to forget her features. The actress dressed by Jacques Fath, the famous French designer, shows why she was one of the best things that happened to the picture.""The Red Shoes"" is one of the best films about ballet thanks to the vision of its directors."
"A great film speaks to each of us in a different way.  To me this more than a colourful piece of escapist entertainment, this was  a glimpse into a world of magnificent color, sumptious settings, French Haute Couture, the theatre, music, luxury hotels, elegant opera houses, chaffeured Rolls Royce cars, travel to the South of France - in short, everything that a child in the near bankrupt England in 1948 had never seen and could barely imagine. 
I was fascinated not only by the glimpse of an elitist life, but of the time capsule which the film presented of a time and place that no longer exists as it was at that time.  The views of London in 1948, are similar to watching ""World War II in Color"" on the history channel.  When the ballet company travelled, they took the train.  Rationing may still have existed back then, and travellers could not take money out of the country, except for a ridiculously inadequate amount; therefore, if you went abroad you had to know someone with whom you could stay.   I also found myself wondering how they got the money to make a technicolour film in 1947, when they began filming. Part of the film takes place in Monte Carlo, only 20 years after the heyday of the famous Ballet Russe.  In fact the ballet company in the film is quite obviously based on the Diaghilev Company.  Former member Leonid Massine has a major part in the film, and Marie Rambert has a cameo role. 
This is also a ballet film for those who do not really care for ballet.  The plot is simple - rising young ballerina falls in love with rising young composer and must choose between him and a career possessively controlled by the impressario - and acts as a frame for the ballet.   The film is as near perfection as it is possible to get, and watching it in 2004, it does not seem to have dated at all.  Everyone, especially Anton Walbrook, is perfectly cast.  The script is witty and occasionally humorous.  The technicolour photography is superb, especially capturing Moira Shearer's flaming red hair. The audio commentary on the DVD adds immensely to the enjoyment of the film, which is one that can be watched over and over.  o understand how great this film really is, try watching Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" travesty afterwards."
"`Why do you want to dance?'  Anton Walbrook asks of Moira Shearer part way through Powell and Pressburger's inventive ballet film.  `Why do you want to live?' is her cool response.  Suggested by the Hans Christian Andersen story and a project long in development by P&P, this sumptuous colour production allows Shearer to display her excellent ballet skills alongside Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine, and all three are excellent. 
In fact, the `Red Shoes Ballet' alone is enough to recommend this movie in the strongest terms.  Also in the cast is P&P regular Marius Goring, as the composer pushed aside for the lure of the stage.  Walbrook, as the emotionless impresario who is only alive within the confines of his art, is superb, and perhaps only his role as Theo in `Colonel Blimp' served him better."
"The resourceful approach that characterizes so many of the Michael Powell/ Emeric Pressburger collaborations makes ""The Red Shoes"" one of the most creative and interesting of any of the ""back stage"" movies that show the lives and dreams of creative artists at work. The characters are quite interesting in themselves, and the story brings out some worthwhile aspects of each of their natures while giving a realistic and often fascinating look at their world.By no means do you have to be a ballet fan to appreciate and enjoy the story or the settings. While fully convincing in themselves, they are also set up so that the most important aspects and conflicts of the plot could easily be applied to those working in other creative fields as well.Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook, and Marius Goring make a nicely balanced and intriguing trio of main characters. The opening scenes work very well in bringing them together while being enjoyable to watch in themselves. From there, the creative tensions are built up steadily as the story itself becomes even more interesting. The script makes use of the best conventions of its genre, while never allowing itself to become formulaic.There is also a good deal of creativity in many of the individual sequences. The opening scene at the opera is particularly clever in playing off of a viewer's initial expectations. The most spectacular sequence is the ""red shoes"" ballet segment itself, a very imaginative and enjoyable mini-movie that also parallels some of the main story's most interesting ideas. All in all, ""The Red Shoes"" well deserves its reputation as a distinctive classic."
"Julian Craster (Marius Goring) is a talented young composer, Vicky Page (Moira Shearer) wants only to dance.  Both wish to work with the Ballet Lermontov and Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), who lives only for the ballet, is shrewd enough to hire them both.  After shaky starts, they achieve first success when Vicky plays the lead in Craster's 'The Red Shoes' at Monte Carlo.  But Lermontov demands total commitment to their art, so when Vicky and Craster fall in love, they must leave the company.  They marry.  Some time later, Vicky returns to Monte Carlo on holiday.  Lermontov relents and she is again to star in 'The Red Shoes'.  Unexpectedly, her husband turns up to reclaim her, with tragic consequences.Who but Powell and Pressburger would have the nerve to present an entire ballet, specially written, within a feature film drama?  The ""Wanna Dance"" sequence in ""Singin' in the Rain"", is, though magnificent, but a bagatelle compared with the ""Red Shoes"" ballet.  The ballet itself is lavishly staged and is a clever cheat, slipping smoothly in and out of the theatre into a world of pure cinema, seeing with the eyes of the audience at one moment, then looking out into an amphitheatre filled with swirling colours.  So, too, the more prosaic moments are perfectly rendered, with the wonderful sense of colour and design and costume that is a badge of The Archers.  And the dancers!  Robert Helpman and Leonide Massine (also the choreographer) dazzle us with their energy and command.  And the puppeteer, or rather the Shoemaker to the the Ballet Lermontov, sits in his Monte Carlo office.  To Vicky's Sylphide he is the basilisk gargoyle that sits on the parapet outside his window.Anton Walbrook delivers a masterly performance as the fanatical, tyrannical, director of the Ballet.  He can be ice cold, but then, a faint smile will seem filled with warmth.  Every nuance of his performance is perfectly timed and delivered.  In his final, passionate, pleading that Vicky abandon love and dedicate herself to dance, he glances momentarily at her dresser, indicating that Vicky is ready to put on her shoes.  He calculates and he controls them all.  But he has miscalculated, and his subsequent address to the theatre audience is delivered with raw chunks of grief, his voice strained, rasping.  Marius Goring, too, is completely convincing as the young musician, his every word and action witnessing his commitment to his art.  So, too, the collection of Russian emigres around Lermontov give sympathetic and well-modulated performances.  Brian Easdale's music supplies all that is needed credibly to support the claims of the film.  But, in the end, even amongst such talent, it is the image of Moira Shearer that endures, dancing her heart out in the ballet, then losing it in the shocking closing scenes."
"The team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger direct and write one of the great ballet melodramas of all time. Hans Christian Andersen's tragic fairy tale serves as the outline for a film about a backstage love story. The film's core relationship between the impresario and dancer was a take on the one between Diaghilev and Nijinsky. It's the kind of dance film that can appeal to a wide audience not just balletomane devotees.Originally, Emeric Pressburger's story was commissioned by producer Alexander Korda for his wife-star Merle Oberon (Oscar nominated for ""Wuthering Heights"" in 1939). One problem was Oberon could not dance. Pressburger then bought the story back and decided to co-direct it with partner Michael Powell with Moira Shearer, a pro dancer who could also act, in the lead. Red-haired Shearer was then a ballerina at Sadler's Wells. In the film, she is joined by such skillful dancers as Léonide Massine, Ludmilla Tchérina, and Robert Helpmann, who also worked on the choreography.It begins when a talented but impoverished musical composer Julian Craster (Goring) attends a London performance of the Lermontov Ballet Company and recognizes his own score being performed without his authorization. Complaining to ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Walbrook - who gives the films best performance), things get resolved when the composer is hired to compose the score for his next work -- a ballet version of ""The Red Shoes."" It's based on Hans Christian Anderson's story about a pair of magical shoes that permit their wearer to magically dance without ever stopping. The impresario also hires a gifted sweet young flaming red-haired dancer, Victoria Page (Moira Shearer, the Sadler's Wells ballerina's debut as an actress), to perform in the ballet.The centerpiece of the film is a stunning 20 minute ballet sequence, where we see The Red Shoes performed, first on traditional stages, but then on increasingly expressionistic and fanciful sets, until it's clear that the brilliant dance and music have taken the performance away from anything approaching reality, onto a plane of pure art, where such things as the laws of physics and time and space don't seem to apply. It's a heartbreaking and wonderful experience. Leonide Massine, who plays the choreographer and who created the unforgettable character of the Shoemaker within the ballet, is considered to be one of the greatest choreographers in the Western World, creating over 50 ballets. It is he, not Moira Shearer, who makes the ballet sequence so entrancing (and I can't say that I traditionally like ballet). You just can't take your eyes off him. Not bad for someone that his mentor, Sergei Diaghilev, called nothing but a good-looking face and poor legs.As a result, the ballet is well received and Julian and Victoria fall madly in love. Meanwhile Boris recognizes how talented Victoria is and puts all his energy into making her the perfect dancer and a slave to her art, as The Red Shoes is set to go on tour throughout Europe. Things get dicey when Julian leaves the company and Victoria marries him over the objections of the overbearing and jealous Svengali-like Boris, who believes her art comes before love. Boris uses his power to prevent her from dancing the role that brought her fame. After the music stops the film comes down from its lofty heights to tell its mundane story. The dancer misses performing her magical role and after meeting the impresario by accident after a long time not seeing him agrees to dance for him again just one more time, thus missing her possessive hubby's premiere of his new work. There's a hidden ""gayness"" to all these melodramatic moves as the three protagonists in the concluding scene in Monaco confront one another and each makes an earnest case for how they stand. It leads to a tragic ending for the dancer who is torn between love and her world of dancing.The Red Shoes is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking films one could ever see, certainly one of the best uses of Technicolor cinematography (if not the best) in the history of film. It's one of the best looks at the tensions that tear at artists who want to devote their lives to their art but find themselves entangled in the affairs of humanity. It's also a very good portrait of the difficulties a woman in the 1950s had deciding between her career and her so-called womanly duties as a wife and mother. Directing/producing/writing team Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger did not--could not--make a bad film in the whole decade of the 1940's or the years bookending it, but with The Red Shoes they created one of the screen's great tragedies."
"A fascinating glimpse into life behind the theater curtain, gorgeous color photography and a number of well-staged ballet sequences are the factors that make THE RED SHOES such a wonderful film to watch. On top of that, the performances are masterful--especially Anton Walbrook as a theater impresario with an obsessive drive to control the girl he believes he can mold into the finest ballet dancer (Moira Shearer). Shearer's flaming red hair reminds one of a British Susan Hayward with the delicate features of Vivien Leigh. Marius Goring is the struggling young composer who falls in love with her as they collaborate on THE RED SHOES and gives one of the film's most interesting performances in a vivid role.I know that it was the intention to give the viewer a glimpse of ""The Red Shoes Ballet"" as it exists inside Moira Shearer's mind--but it illustrates a point of weakness that is always present when we are watching--presumably--a stage presentation in the movies. None of the scenes could realistically have been performed before an audience of theatergoers. It's all strictly cinematic in conception. While I view this as a flaw, I'm sure other devotees of this film don't.Marred only by an ending that seems too hurried to be accepted but does follow the framework of the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale.All in all, a rich viewing experience not to be missed if you want to see the best of British film-making in the late '40s and their truly wondrous use of color in film. Definitely a masterpiece of its kind."
"The successful impresario Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) gives an opportunity in the Lermontov Opera to the talented young composer and conductor Julian Craster (Marius Goring) and to the gorgeous red-haired ballerina Victoria ""Vicky"" Page (Moira Shearer), whose greatest passion is to dance. Sooner Vicky becomes the lead dancer of his company and a sensation in Europe. Craster composes the ballet ""The Red Shoes"" based on the fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen and Vicky falls in love with him. The jealous Lermontov sends Craster away and Vicky decides to leave the company and marry Craster. However, when Lermontov meets Vicky one year later, he offers the position of lead ballerina in his ballet back to her; the youth feels divided between her passion for dancing and her love for Craster, leading her to a tragedy decision.""The Red Shoes"" is a magnificent work of art and one of the most beautiful features I have ever seen. The story of the ballerina Vicky, a woman that can not live without dancing and is pressed by her beloved husband and by the manager of the ballet company to choose between her life of wife or ballerina, is heartbreaking. Moira Shearer is very beautiful and the color of the restored DVD released by Continental Distributor is fantastic. ""The Red Shoes"" deserves the awarded Oscar of Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color, and Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os Sapatinhos Vermelhos"" (""The Little Red Shoes"")"
"A young amateur ballerina called Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) meets famed ballet producer Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) at a ballet after party, impressing him enough to invite her to join his company. At breakfast the next morning Lermontov also meets an inspiring young composer by the name of Julian Craster (Marius Goring) and he too is invited to join the company. The two talented youngsters begin to work their way up through the company ranks as a romance blossoms between them. There are tough decisions to be made however when it comes to a choice between ambition and love.I bought The Red Shoes of Blu-Ray about three or four years ago after hearing Martin Scorsese say it was one of his favourite films. Now I've finally seen it I can see why someone would enjoy it on an artistic and technical level but it left me feeling very bored.The first thing to strike me about the film was its wonderful use of colour. Everything is so bright and vivid and it's incredibly striking. Although Technicolor had been invented in 1916 it wasn't widely used in the film industry until the 1940s. After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, studios began to think of the medium as the future. The use of colour in The Red Shoes is stunning and is definitely one of the highlights of the film for me. I wondered if the colour was made to be so bright and vivid because the directors were working in a relatively new and unexplored medium, just as today 3D films seem to make an extra effort to have things poking out of the screen at the audience. Unlike 3D which is in my view rarely if ever improves a film, the colour in The Red Shoes most definitely enhances the viewing experience.The plot revolves around a story within a story with Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tail The Red Shoes being performed inside the film. I was never really interested in the characters and I think this is because the film was very predictable. I was always one step ahead, able to anticipate what was coming next. This was true even of the shocking ending which I worked out just a couple of minutes earlier. This isn't a film with twists or surprises. Even so I thought that the ending was done very well and I loved the thirty seconds on stage after the 'surprise'. I thought it was beautiful and moving. One of the problems I had with the film was my indifference to ballet. I've tried to enjoy it a couple of times when I've been to see ballet and although I have huge admiration for the ability of the dancers I can't help but find it confusing and dull. I'd love to be able to say I can follow a ballet but I just can't. As about a third of the film is purely dancing I often found my mind wandering to other things.Although I'm no ballet fan I did find the performance of The Red Shoes ballet sometimes interesting. The fairy tail element peaked my interest a little and it felt almost surrealist at times. I was reminded of Disney's Fantasia at various moments. The prolonged dance scene half way through was also very well edited. The costumes' were also well designed and the music, although not to my taste, was excellent. Occasionally the film was overacted, perhaps in part due to the cast been predominantly ballerinas first, actors second. I let this go slightly as a lot of the cast were working in their second or third language. Both leads were very good and Anton Walbrook stood out as the charismatic but vicious impresario. Another thing I liked was to see London's Covent Garden as it was in the 1940s. It's an area I've been though many times and looks very different today. The same is true of Paris and Monte Carlo which are also interesting to see over sixty years ago.For me The Red Shoes is a lot like ballet itself. It is admirable and I wanted to enjoy it but I often felt bored and kind of couldn't wait for it to be over.www.attheback.blogspot.com"
"I saw The Red Shoes for the third time yesterday, it's probably my third favourite Archers film after A Matter of life and death and Black Narcissus, I haven't commented on any of these films out of fear I would not be able to eloquently put into words my feelings on their work. But after seeing the meagre amount of comments this film has received, it's time to try.The Red Shoes is one of the most exquisite pieces of art I have ever seen, every shot is tightly composed, brimming with colour and texture, there's a real feel of the hustle and bustle of the everyday world these characters inhabit. But unlike other Powell & Pressburger films, The Red Shoes is very weak when it comes to characters. As many have pointed out there aren't really any likable characters, most are either too meek or just not emphasized enough to get a real connection with them. No this should have been first and foremost a ballet film, that sadly only features one real dance sequence, the haunting production of the titular ""Ballet of the Red Shoes"". The performances are good enough, with all three principals (Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring and Moira Shearer) delivering, but the script just doesn't fit them. However the ideas of the film are so timeless, that you can't help feel for all of them at the tragic conclusion. So I give The Red Shoes a rating of 8/10, mainly for the Red Shoes sequence and Jack Cardiff's cinematography. This is a classic that should be discovered by every generation."
"No one has ever been better served by Technicolor than Moira Shearer.....with that transparent skin and flaming red hair, she is a treat for the eye, as is the film itself. Based loosely on the Hans Christian Anderson story of the cursed red shoes, this is a very unusual film with over the top acting styles and offering a glimpse of the ballet world to which the non-performer is not privy. Some may find it a bit too stylized for their tastes but it draws you in, just as the red shoes weave their spell. The major players are quite good with the exception of Marius Goring, a rather bland actor. It calls for a suspension of belief to imagine Shearer giving up her one love, ballet, for Goring. Anton Walbrook is mesmerizing as Lermontov and we expect him to win in the end, although his victory is short-lived. Several well known names in ballet offer support....particularly notable are Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Powell and Pressburger bought the screenplay from Alexander Korda who had planned to film it in the 1930's but didn't. Bad call by Korda since the film won 2 Oscars and has become a classic for the ages. It's a fairy tale film which is not to be missed."
"Beautiful to look at, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's ""The Red Shoes"" is astonishing and ravishing as photographed in color by Jack Cardiff: blood reds, creamy whites, midnight blues and inky ebonies all blend together as if in a dream. A would-be prima ballerina and a would-be music composer both come in contact with a brilliant showman, an impresario who becomes their mentor but soon tries to destroy their love for each other. The ""Red Shoes"" ballet sequence is, of course, the highlight--and it's interesting to note you do not see it from the audience's point of view, but from within the dancer's imagination. This centerpiece alone puts all other ballet films to shame, and in fact makes some (like Herbert Ross's ""The Turning Point"") seem downright irrelevant. Problems with the last act may be due to the constraints of (and faithfulness to) the Hans Christian Andersen fable the plot derives from, but the finale is so over-dramatic it may provoke some giggles. The picture manages to capture happily frantic backstage life like no other movie, and is memorable and exciting for many different reasons, but when the final bows come, the story has somewhat molded over. *** from ****"
"When a world famous ballet company under the direction of the great Lermontov employs a young hopeful dancer the hope is to turn her into one of the world's greatest.  When a young composer (Craster) is also employed it sparks conflict within the creative trio.  Craster and Victoria fall in love to the detriment of their careers as Lermontov begins to realise he is not only losing Victoria but also losing the chance for her to ever dance Craster's `The Red Shoes' ballet again.With time this film appears to have become more famous and have a better reputation.  This seems to be mainly because of praise and commendations from modern directors like Scorsese and Spielberg who cite it as a reference.  But to ignore that fact that the film is worthy of praise even without such famous referees to fight it's corner.  The reason that it is worth seeing is simply the richness of the production.  While much British cinema in 1948 was black and white this film not only used full colour but is a rich vibrant colour which is combined which a lavish production and wonderful imagery.The ballet scene itself is worth watching it for and is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  By taking it beyond the stage and into the minds of the dancers it adds layers of beauty where before we would have only had the audience in the background.  However I don't hold the same opinion as many who feel it is one of the greatest films ever made  it isn't, although I can understand how it would make such an impression in a black & white world  even now it is visually impressive.The weakness for me is the actual story.  I know that it is loosely based on the real life unresolved relationship between Diaghilev and his protégé Nijinksy but the telling here lacks the wonder and power of the production. Instead much of it is a more mundane love-triangle melodrama that often fails to involve.  It is still gripping at times and the climax is worthy but it still can't compare to the overall production that is to the detriment of the film.The characters aren't as full as they needed to be and they don't involve as well as they should have as a result.  Walbrook is good as the driven ballet master and adds passion as well as restraint to his performance.  Goring is a little less complex and plays it a little plainer for much of the film as a result.  Shearer is wonderful when she has to dance but as an actress she doesn't always convince.  However for all my reservations they all do pretty well for the climax that could have been ridiculously overwrought but is good enough.Overall this is a wondrous film despite the slightly weak melodramatic telling of the central plot.  However the colour and richness of the film more than make up for these problems."
"This was the first film from the Powell-Pressburger team that I saw, and, to use a phrase that was popular at the time (early '80's), it knocked my socks off. Recently, it was among a handful of DVD's I loaned to a friend who was housebound for a week recovering from minor surgery. When she said ""Oh, I've heard of this"" with some trepidation, I responded, ""It was sort of the MOULIN ROUGE of its day,"" knowing she was a fan of that movie. Though it really came off the top of my head, upon reflection I realized the comparison was apt.Though I can't say I was particularly impressed by MOULIN ROUGE, I have to give it credit for much of the same things I admire about THE RED SHOES."" Both are innovative, and stretch the boundaries of film-making technology, narrative structure and visual design. They also have a thematic kinship, having to do with the conflict between love and career, which is symbolically expressed in a show-within-a-show.Here (with the possible exception of the effect on audiences of their respective periods), the similarities end. I bring them up only (as I did with my friend) as an incentive to those unfamiliar with THE RED SHOES (or Powell & Pressburger) who may not realize that work which seems so cutting-edge today is not all that new, and that there may be exciting viewing experiences in store for them from films made during an era to which they may not have given much consideration (or by which they may not have expected to be impressed).I'd also encourage any prospective viewers who might be put off by the ""balletic"" plot elements (""Ballet? Yuk!"") to overcome such reservations. I can't imagine anyone who appreciates cinema craft at any level (and who isn't a complete Philistine) not uttering a quiet ""Wow!"" more than a few times during this picture.As with many Powell & Pressburger productions, THE RED SHOES is highly stylized at times and, despite comparisons made earlier here, a unique piece of film-making. All cinephiles owe themselves the opportunity to hop onto this magic carpet and be dazzled."
"There are many films about ambitious young people trying to make a career in showbusiness. Think about ""All about Eve"" (1950, Joseph Mankiewicz, film), ""Singin in the rain"" (1952, Stanley Donen, musical) and ""A star is born"" (several years, several directors, pop music). In al these films the aim is stardom and the means is getting to know the right acquaintances (by chance or by manipulation).Not so in ""The red shoes"". Here the aim is perfection and the means are total dedication or (formulated differently) bedevilment. In this respect ""The red shoes"" has much more in common with films such as ""Black swan"" (2010, Darran Aronofsky) and ""Whiplash"" (2014, Damien Chazelle) than with the above mentioned films.Central in ""The red shoes"" are the characters of Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) as the impresario of the ballet Lermontov, Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) as a young ballet dancer and Julian Craster (Marius Goring) as a young composer. Victoria and Julia are discovered by Boris Lermontov, but during the course of the film they fall in love with each other. This much to the displeasure of Borils Lermontov, who demands of his collaboraters total dedication to their art form. It is impossible to combine a human romance with this total dedication (is the opinion of Boris Lermontov). And so Victoria Page has to choose between her love for Julian Crastor and her love for ballet.In ""The red shoes"" Boris Lermontov is a sort of Mephistopheles. When you sell your soul to him, he delivers greatness (in for example a specific art form) but there is no way back. Surprisingly I did not find the charcter of Lermontov less sympathetic than that of Craster. Apart from the fact that Walbrook is a beter actor than Goring, I think there are a few other reasons. In a certain dialogue Lermontov asks Victoria if she would ask Craster to give up music. When she says that she would never do that he asks on what ground Craster can ask her to give up ballet. Lermontov certainly has a point here. In another scene we are witnesses of the marriage of Page and Craster. They sleep in seperate beds (unusual for a newly married couple) and Julian stands up in the middle of the night to rehearse a new piece of music. How deep does their love go?""The red shoes"" is based on the fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. This fairy tale character is most prominent in the best known scene of the film, a ballet sequency of more than a quarter of an hour. This ballet sequence begins as a life performance but than assumes a surreal character as it reflects the subjective emotions of Victoria Page while performing. This scene easily matches and even surpasses famous long dancing scenes as in ""The earrings of Madame de ... "" (1953, Max Ophuls), ""Il Gattopardo"" (1963, Luchino Visconti) and particularly (as this is also a surreal sequence) the Broadway melody sequence with Cyd Charisse in ""Singin in the rain"" (1952, Stanley Donen).The scene is a perfect co-operation between actress (Moira Shearer, one of the most beautiful red heads I have ever seen), set design (Hein Hecktoth) and cinematographer (Jack Cardiff)."
"Breathtakingly gorgeous and dramatically compelling from the first few shots, this quasi-adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's original fairy tale has no parallel. Set primarily in the backstage world of professional ballet, the movie benefits from the extraordinary grace and precision of the multitudinous ballet dancers seen throughout, as well the inherent drama of ballet itself. In addition, the story of the overlapping pursuit of concurrent professional and personal bliss is universal and timeless, rooting the movie in a compelling middle ground of immediacy and timelessness. Lead Moira Shearer is perfectly cast here in a demanding role that requires both dancing and deep emotional depth, and she tackles it fearlessly. There's nothing else quite like this."
"I love ballet and I love ballet films. I also love Hans Christian Andersen. This was beautifully acted, beautifully danced, and I cannot believe I have never seen it before. It perhaps moves a bit slowly in some parts, but otherwise I have no complaints."
"Viewed at the 2000 Karlovy Vary film festival.
One of the great revelations of the week in Karlovy was the rediscovery, in a section devoted to older classics, of the great English ballet drama ""The Red Shoes"", from the year 1948. I had seen the film years before and remembered that it had impressed me way back then, but I had forgotten, or perhaps hadn't realized at the time, how truly magnificent and extraordinary this incredible picture actually is.
The basic plot is a love triangle between a beautiful red headed ballerina, her despotic impresario, and a younger musician, set in an incredibly colorful Monte Carlo. Moira Shearer, an actual professional ballerina was the dancer, and most imposing as the possessed impresario, was Austrian actor Anton Walbrook. This picture, based to a certain extent on a Danish fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson in which a dancer dons red shoes which make her into a marvelous dancer, but then won't let go and force her to dance herself to death, is the perfect merger of classic dance, high Greek tragedy, and Hollywood staging. Unquestionably one of the most beautiful and compelling motion pictures ever made. 
 
""Red Shoes"" directed by the British masters Powell and Pressburger, is the kind of picture that makes sitting through a thousand other banalities worth while, and makes you remember why you fell in love with the flickers in the first place. I was most delighted to find that the film would be repeated, and put everything else on hold so I could see it again the next night. Had there been nothing else of note during the festival, RED SHOES would have been enough to justify the trip. It's just one of those movies that satisfies you to the core and leaves you ravished. Words fail. See it if you ever get a chance, preferably on the big screen"
"""Why do you dance?"" ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) impassibly asks Vicki Page (Moira Shearer), another of these Covent Garden dreamers who can't fool him.
But Miss Vicky plays in another league, she marks a pause and retorts ""why do you want to live?"", the man who was so stingy in smiles lets one slip, he's obviously amused by that question, it's a rhetorical one but he answers nonetheless, that's how thrown off he is: ""I don't know, but I must"" That's her answer too.
And that simple exchange encapsulates what Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's classic masterpiece ""The Red Shoes"" is about: Passion.
The film is one of the greatest, if not the all-time best movie about ballet, it's all fitting that the title contains the word ""shoes"", but its soul rests in the word ""red"" word, red like the fire that ignites three people caught in an odd triangle of love and dedication to art. Some do arts for a living, some live for art, what when these two visions collide? What when there's a choice to make? But I'm being hasty here, let's get back to the genesis ... or how a simple screenplay meant to be a vehicle for a Hollywood star became another bull's-eye from the Archers!
The screenplay is actually both an original and an adapted one, like many self-referential show-within-show movies, it is based on a pre-existing work and make backstage realities and fictional shows converge toward the sameconclusion. One can make an easy comparison with Darren Arronofksy's ""Black Swan"" and Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" as the emotional skeleton. Working on an existing work is crucial because two original stories can strike as contrived coincidences while a work with an existence of its own allows a better suspension of disbelief.And it's like Hans Christian Andersen's tale was begging for such a parallel story. The tale is about a woman who puts on some red shoes from a Demonic shoemaker and then can't stop dancing, what starts as an enchanting musical escapade with her boyfriend turns out into a nightmare, the girl dances until she wears nothing but rags and end up so exhausted she got her feet cut to stop the curse... the story is the perfect embodiment of the way passion can drive people to extremes... with a few Faustian undertones.
Powell and Pressburger made a lavish movie about people who are all deeply dedicated to their art and can't allow anything to interfere with it, it's just as if there was a sort of a pact with the devil in a movie that doesn't seem to have any villains. Lermontov is the closest to one but it's more a posture than a nature. Played with dignified severity by Walbrook, he's the kind of man who doesn't let any emotions interfere with work and his only outburst of genuine sympathy happen to be approvals of good work. And when he hires a young pianist as an assistant conductor, it's because he can recognize talent when he sees it.
Julian Craster (Marius Goring) doesn't have the flashiest role of the leading trio but his seemingly lack of physical appeal justifies that he would be the easiest to surrender to love while enhancing Lermontov's frustration that Vicki make a rival out of such a bland man. Lermontov' fortress of confidence is obviously shaken; he could have lost Vicki's heart for Art but not for Julian. We know from that point that tragedy is tiptoeing toward their people's lives. Lermontov himself was based on famous Ballet Russes founder who fired two dancers after they fell in love.
But as riveting as the story is, it doesn't tell one tenth about the film's greatness.
""The Red Shoes"" is a dazzling looking film served with Technicolor magnificence, restored with the sheer passion of Martin Scorsese who holds it as one of his favorites, a movie where the hair of Moira Shearer can't inspire any better description than the one written in Powell's memoirs ""an autumn bonfire"", and where the score and the cinematography render all the grace and magic of the ballet and the tragedy of great art, summed up in that meaningful statement: ""a great impression of simplicity can only be achieved by great agony of body and spirit.""
While ""Black Swan"" was an introspection into the agony and spirit of a tormented soul with the same tragic perfection at the end, ""Red Shoes"" is a more extraverted hymn to the beauty of dance and the way the music can command the most graceful fantasies, and the film couldn't have conveyed that message had it not contaminated the crew, which means the director, art-designers, the camera operators, the writer and the choreographers.
""The Red Shoes"" is renowned for a long ballet sequence when we can have a proper view on Moira Shearer's talent as a professional dancer. That Powell wanted a real dancer was the right approach, proving that he respected viewers, art and artists and that a debutante like Shearer or professional dancers such as Leonide Massine or Ludmilla Tchérina could be so natural is one of these miracles allowed by the Gods of the reel when you show them enough respect.
The dancers might have made a pact with the Devil, the Archers made one with Heaven. And as for the ballet in itself, it's a moment of pure heavenly magic that transcends the story and puts us viewers in Vicki's state of mind, it's a surreal combination of stage artifices and camera magic, an extraordinary symbiosis between reality and dreams. It's also a masterstroke of directing featuring many daring special effects we would be wowing over if we weren't so drawn by the music and the art-direction (two deserved Oscar wins for the film).
Truffaut demanded that a film expressed ""either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema"". That's exactly what ""The Red Shoes"" are about: joy and agony disguised as sheer virtuosity."
"Had the story throughout this film managed to sustain the level of drama it achieved up to and including the performance of the ballet of the Red Shoes, then this would have been right up in the top ten films of all time.It is often a beautiful, magical, wondrous thing to look at and like it's predecessor Black Narcissus, manages to achieve something far beyond the normal conventions of cinematography. The whirlwind drama created by commanding auteur Boris Lermontov builds slowly and gradually, increasingly dramatic pace and tension culminating with the performance of the Red Shoes.Here we are shown the truly graphic nature of the musical imagery Craster (it's composer) describes earlier, the dance, fabulous by itself is supported by visual and musical invention that transcribes the ballet and the role of the dancer. She becomes intertwined with the art itself until glimpses of Craster and Lermontov intervene and we are returned to mere theatre. It is here where my reservations begin. Somehow, during the performance, Lermontov has been transformed. From a remote but vital creator surrounded by a bunch of supportive, equally creative adjutants where his work is everything, he is reduced to a love-sick puppy blinded to his ambitions by an overwhelming physical love for one woman. This to my mind is just too big a fish to swallow.Circumstances dictate that he never has the opportunity to declare this love, but instead hides his emotions behind his previous persona, before setting in train a chain of events that lead to the films shocking but inevitable climax. Unfortunately, though it is dramatic, it's also a bit of an anti-climax, whereas the death of Lermontov in some equally dramatic fashion would have given a much more satisfactory conclusion to the whole endeavour. Whatever, don't be put off by my musings, if you love film, you must watch this."
"Aside from a few compulsory school-related occasions upon which I look back with the utmost antipathy, I've never danced in my life. I've never wanted to, and I plan to hold firm at least until the day of my wedding. As late as last year, I regarded ballet as among the least interesting forms of dance, my assertion based not on experience, but mere conjecture. Then I saw Norman McLaren's extraordinary short film 'Pas de deux (1968),' in which an optical printer is used to demonstrate how the dancers' movements transcend space and time, the majesty of human motion revealed in every gentle, graceful spin. Suddenly, inexplicably, I saw beauty where I'd never seen it before. I consider 'The Red Shoes (1948)' the affirmation of this revelation. The child of writing/directing team Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, under the banner of The Archers, the film showcases the pair's talent for imbuing their work with lush colours, warmth and personality, displaying a faculty for capturing atmosphere that is unmatched then or since.'The Red Shoes' revolves around the production of a stage adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's eponymous fairy-tale, in which a ballet dancer receives a pair of cursed red shoes that keep her dancing until the day she dies. However, rather than being a simple story of success in show- business, the behind-the-scenes events are themselves a loose variation on Andersen's fairy-tale. When asked what she wants from life, young British ballerina Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) replies, ""I want to dance."" Just as Mephisto offered Faust everything he wanted at the cost of everything he held dear, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook, of 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943)') offers Victoria immortality in the art of ballet, but at the expense of life, love and happiness. Finally, torn between her two great loves – to her husband Julian (Marius Goring), and to ballet – she chooses to abandon both, throwing herself in front of a train as though compelled to do so by the red dancing shoes that had so overwhelmingly commanded her life.As in most Powell/Pressburger collaborations, it's not adequate to merely praise the co-directors. Hein Heckroth's costumes, Arthur Lawson's art direction, Jack Cardiff's lush cinematography, Brian Easdale's musical score; all are utterly masterful, the fruits of a alliance in which every crew member understood perfectly what was required of them. The film's incredible centrepiece is a twenty- minute balletic interlude in which the audience is shown the stage production itself, perhaps the most breathtaking and purely cinematic musical sequence I've ever seen. As Victoria Page is swept up in the fantasy of her role, she is inundated by surreal visions of Faustian tragedy and horror that deliberately recall F.W. Murnau's 1926 film. In Hollywood, 'The Red Shoes' proved hugely influential, noticeably inspiring the likes of Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli: 'An American in Paris (1951)' featured a similar, if not so comfortably integrated, ballet interlude, and 'The Band Wagon (1953)' feels like a sunny feature-length rebuttal to the tragedy inherent in The Archers' film."
"""The Red Shoes"" hits you like an explosion of color. The directing team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, known for their expressionistic visual film style, tell this fairy tale tragedy about the brief moment of fame in the life of a young and beautiful ballerina as if they're not only trying to capture the physical act of dance on screen, but also the tone and feeling that dance brings forth in its audience.The story is as simple as they come, as befits a fairy tale, and overall I didn't find the film as satisfying or compelling as my favorite film from this team, ""Black Narcissus"" (1947), but it's still a wondrous, bold, eye-popping treat of a movie.Grade: A"
I have seen this movie numerous times and time and time again - it's gets better. As a former dancer I can relate to a lot in this film. You are always struggling with dancing or having a personal life. It's kind of impossible to do both. Think about - can you name 5 famous male ballet dancers? You can't.This movie is visually stunning and the music and costumes are exceptional. If you are a dancer - you will understand and relate to movie like no other - if you are not a dancer - you will relate to this movie like a dancer and a person who has ever been in love or is in love now. It will tug at your heart strings and make you cry - if you let it.Enjoy it with a loved one - trust me - he or she will thank you when the credits start to roll.The first time I saw this movie years ago when I was still dancing - I watched it with my mother (also a former ballerina) and we both cried our eyes out and related to it. Enjoy 10 * out 10.
"While I found the plot and characters of The Red shoes simple, I couldn't help but be awestruck by the grandeur and eloquence of the production. Technicolor never looked better then it did here. The sets and costumes are gorgeous and fully taken advantage of by the directors. The performance of ""The Red Shoes"" which serves as a centerpiece to the film is simply one of the most impressive sequences I've ever seen. This movie also has one of my favorite cuts of all time. After announcing she is engaged to the company, a dancer notices Boris has left and says to herself he is a cruel man. We then cut to a wide shot of Boris alone in a large dark room, framed by a moonlit window. It is a stunning moment to behold. The performances are for the most part subdued and cold,but match the tone and subject of the text enough that they are not a distraction. I particularly thought Walbrook, who played the producer, nailed a few of his more difficult scenes. The only real problem I had with the script was the ending, which felt forced and not truthful to the character of Victoria. Definitely a must for any die hard fans of lavish technicolor productions."
"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*""The Red Shoes"" is the story of a woman who would like to live a life that is both professionally AND privately fulfilling - but the two men in her life (one personifying Love and Private Happiness, the other her professional passion, Dancing) do not permit her to incorporate both in her life. The conflict comes from the fact that neither man wants to recognize her as an artist and a personality in her own right, but rather as a vehicle of their own aspirations.During the budding romance with Craster, though, we see that her dream could be fulfilled: she dances to the music that he writes for her; both live a professionally and personally fulfilling life by cooperating. But Lermontov wants Vicky to be his creation and not to be attached to anyone or anything else except dancing. (It is obvious that he is not interested in her sexually or romantically - some said he might be gay, which can well be, but in the end, it doesn't matter, as Lermontov is rather the personification of his own ideal, a person only committed to his profession and to nothing and nobody else.)As the story develops, it turns out that to Craster, she is nothing more than an inspiration for his own work (he doesn't seem to bother that she is professionally unfulfilled while he reacts aggressively when she takes a step to dance again); to Lermontov, she is the clay she wants to form his own creation (a ""great dancer"") of. Though most supporting characters seem to recognize Vicky as an artist in her own right, the two men that matter most in her life do not. This is what leads ultimately to her downfall, as she is not able to choose between love and dancing, because both form a whole inside her. She rather sacrifices herself (though in the end it is not clear, to what extent) and thus affirms herself as a person and artist.A beautiful film (though not as supreme as I had expected it to be), with a great performance by Anton Walbrook and beautiful dancing scenes (though the not-so-perfect special effects in the otherwise highly original and captivating centerpiece were a bit disconcerting). I also like the passionate conflict of the story (the passion here is of the ""sublimated"" rather than of the downright erotic kind - it is very refreshing that the conflict between Vicky, Craster and Lermontov is not reduced to a mere love triangle). And, of course, a must for ballet lovers."
"Spoilers herein.Over the past two years, I've been working to see and understand what I think important in film. My primary value is in the exploration of selfreferential storytelling. That's where the story in the film is about the story of the film. The filmmakers have surrogates. The film is represented therein by a show or writing of some kind.Another thing that I value is the self-aware, active camera. That's one that participates in the action. Clearly, this an the self-referential construction can support each other. But the cinematic camera can go places not reducable in narrative terms.The third thing surprised me. I've become enchanted with the role that redheaded women play in film. I believe their use can carry significant power, and that some sophisticated entanglement between reflecting and creating society is at work.Well, this film has all three. It has a lovely redhead. She is the subject of the film and also the creator of the show within the show. She is the focus of the motion around her and the generator of motion which illuminates all. The film can be seen as her own fairytale, beginning in her dream with her in princess garb going up that marvelous stairway. And she is absolutely enchanting until the end where she has to act and can't quite pull it off. But she is photographed as a person with a loving lens.And this film is deeply, deeply self-referential. I think it springs from the similarly structured, French `Children of Paradise,' of a couple years prior. The initial backstage scenes are strikingly similar as well. `Who's in charge?' The important similarities are the focus for multiple control over a girl, the nesting of performance within the performance and the mixing of the creation of the film with the creation of the performances displayed. The Hungarian producer has a surrogate in the impresario played by a Hungarian, the director in the composer. The girl is an actress, a character as dancer and the character within the dance. All three are cursed by the strength of the story to take over the reality in which it is placed. I love this stuff.But there's more: this is the first time to my knowledge where the camera self-consciously enters the action, changes reality, even creates new frames of reality> The camera dances. The camera allows the dancer and magical shoes to create their own realities. The camera is never a static audience, even in the framing sections that come before and after the ballet. This camera, in this film, changed our visual imagination forever.And it has the best DVD extras I have ever seen. The Jeremy Irons/Humbert connection is delicious.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this."
"Its Martin Scorsese's favorite film. Its been th inspiration of millions of little girls to dance ballet. Its a film who's magic eludes me.A couple of things at the outset. As a rule I really dislike ballet. I don't get it. I am also not a particular fan of the directors Powell and Pressberger. Why would I bother seeing the film with two things going against it? because I have been told as long as I can remember that its a great film.I don't see what the fuss is about.The story of a girl who must contend with the men who love her while giving everything for her art is on the face of it compelling. However Powell and Pressberger have made a tale that is highly artificial. Yes I know its suppose to be art, but to me great art should seem natural and real, even in its artifice. Everything in the Red Shoes feels unreal and unnatural beginning with the pumped up color. Nothing in real life looks like this. Actually I felt as though I was watching a German expressionistic film but in color, and with out the connection to the heart (the fate of our heroine made me giggle).To be honest I can't argue about the film on a technical level. Its a brilliantly made film. Its as finely a constructed film as they come. However I can't see past the construction. I can't see anything else. There is no heart, no connection to the audience. There is only the artifice passing as art.I don't think this is a truly great film in the way that the best films are, I don't think it truly touches ones heart the way that it should. I think its a film that is less than its reputation."
"I wanted to see this film because of its reputation as one of Britain's finest films, but as I find with a lot of highly praised films your expectations are way too high and can't be fulfilled. I found ""The Red Shoes"" quite disappointing and not the amazing film I was led to believe it was. You have to admire the colour and style which is still incredible after 50 years. I also liked the music, and the ballet sequence was inventively directed, but Walbrook & Goring played characters who were not likeable which failed to draw you in to a story which was too melodramatic for you to care about. I've enjoyed all the Powell/Pressburger films that I have seen up to now and I think they are one of cinema's greatest treasures, but this one failed to excite me. (5/10)"
"This was the first film by directors Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger that I saw, and personally I didn't really like it that much. Later I saw A Matter of Life and Death and was blown away by its brilliance, but for me, The Red Shoes just didn't make enough of a connection. The Red Shoes is a very emotionless film, a film that revolves more around style and film techniques than story, a very sad fact as the film could have been one of the best ever if it had, had just a little more to do with the character's lives and emotions. I just didn't buy the predicament that Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) and the writer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) found themselves in; their love just didn't transfer well enough for me to feel that bothered at the end. The performances (with the exception of Anton Walbrook) where underwritten and not all that well performed, but if the film has a saving grace, then it has to be the dance of the red shoes sequence, if only the film had had more ballet in it I might have been able to give this film a higher vote, but alas no. This is the only real dance number in the film. That said it's still one of the greatest scenes I've ever seen, with Jack Cardiff's amazing use of colour and angles. Not a great film, but it has enough beauty in twenty minutes that some films lack in a two-hour running time, for that the film gets 7/10."
"After the War, the British-based writing production and direction team of Emrich Pressburger and Michael Powell's cinematic ambition grew apace. Following on from one of my all-time favourites ""A Matter Of Life And Death"", came this fantastical almost operatic piece purporting to be a backstage drama set in the balletic and classical music world. The opening scene of a horde of young students charging into a theatre for the cheap seats to a programme of classical music looks incredibly anachronistic today, as indeed does much of the film with its highly mannered acting replete with cut-glass accents and flashing eyebrows everywhere.Thus my point about opera where the players have to aim for the back row with both voice and gesture, accompanied by an other-wordly plot and of course a Carmen-like death at its conclusion. In fact for the first half-hour the action is somewhat stilted as we're introduced to the almost clichéd characters of the aspiring young composer, played by a wide-eyed Marius Goring, the pretty deb-cum-prima-ballerina Moira Shearer with even wider eyes and widest eyes of all Anton Wallbrook as the dastardly dictatorial musical producer, Mr Lermontov. The movie titles are very quick to posit the ""Any resemblance to the living"" legend which makes me wonder if some of the characterisations were drawn from the real world, but it all rolls along quite conventionally until Ms Shearer dons the red shoes and we're transported into high fantasy with the arguments of life versus art, life imitating art and art for art's sake played out by the three principals.Shearer's extended ""Red Shoes"" sequence at the centre of the film must be one of Powell's most imaginative pieces and from there to the end, we're treated to dazzling visuals, arresting music and wonderful ballet dancing. Especially memorable in this fifteen minute segment are Shearer's jumping into the red shoes initially and her later dance with a newspaper which comes magically to life. To be truthful, the human story gets lost somewhat along the way under the glory of set-pieces such as this, but then again, I understand that plot isn't really what attracts people to the opera anyway.This film will be remembered above all else for Shearer's beauty as the doomed heroine, destined to play out the ""Red Shoes"" legend to its tragic conclusion and director Powell's wonderful vision in elevating the world of the theatre to the screen in a glorious construction of music and colour."
"This is a legendary movie but one that I only watched in it's entirety a couple of months ago. I always thought it would be a bit too high brow for my tastes as I knew it was set amongst the world of ballet. I was pleased to find that I enjoyed the movie a lot and it was one of those films that stuck in my mind.The central plot revolves around three character's and it is at times a complex relationship between the three. For what it's worth,this is my take on what exactly drove those people to act in the way they did.Boris Lermontov - A man with a true love of ballet. Driven,obsessive,selfish and above all a perfectionist. Always well groomed and immaculately turned out,he wants nothing but the very best for his ballet company. He grooms Victoria Page and sees in her the potential to be the best dancer in the world. Does he love her? I think that he loves the idea of making her the best dancer that she possibly can be. He does have feelings for her and that is something he has never felt for any dancer before. But love? No,just a selfish desire to own her,to feel that she can't function without him.Julian Craster - Similar to Boris in some ways. He too is driven and selfish but the major difference is that he is truly in love with Victoria. He is jealous of his wife's feelings for Boris as he states ""You can dance anywhere but NOT here"" when she is in turmoil after returning to Boris' ballet company. He too wants to own her and although his motives are selfish he is deeply in love.Victoria Page - A complex lady. In love with Julian and Boris but perhaps more in love with dance that anything else in her life. She leaves Boris for her love of Julian but it is dance that drives her to her death. Does she return because of Boris or the ballet? A bit of both and when faced with the decision to choose between her husband or dance,she chooses ballet,at least at first. Does she mean to kill herself? Her mind is in turmoil as she spurns her husband. She doesn't want to lose him,she doesn't want to lose her life's ambition to be the best dancer she possibly could be. It is here that the Red Shoes take over and as she runs to her husband she is blind to the peril that faces her. Ultimately she is stuck in the middle of a love triangle with her husband on one side and Boris on the other. The Red Shoes decide her fate.This is a film that deserves it's status as a classic. Gorgeous to look at and well acted. Moira Shearer exudes charm as Victoria, Marius Goring hits just the right note as Julian and there are nice touches from Robert Helpmann(Ivan) and Leonide Massine(Grischa). It has to be said though that the most compelling performance comes from Anton Walbrook as Boris. Confident,arrogant,charming and aloof,this is a fine performance that stays in the memory. Don't be put off by the theme of this movie. It is very well made and well worth watching."
"First of all, some disclaimers  this is my first experience with Powell and Pressburger, and my knowledge of ballet is very limited. So please don't be upset if I don't offer too many insights along those lines  these are just my personal reactions and reflections on this great film on first viewing.I was mostly taken in just by the style and grace of the film, both in the musical and most of the dramatic moments. Of course in this, as with most great musical films, the line between them is fine. The actual ""Red Shoes Ballet"" itself is an astounding work of art. The themes and their application to the story are quite apparent, but this section has its own integrity and could stand alone as art. Then it's interesting to think about how the overall theme of the film is art itself  specifically the tension between art and individuality, or the works of the artist which stretch for a timeless and placeless value and the personal desires and ambitions of the artist which are limited in scope but have their own value to any person. Like I said I don't really understand ballet, but this sequence is really impressive. We're immediately clued in to the fact that we are not seeing the ballet literally as it was staged, but as a kind of impressionist picture of how it feels to be the dancer in the ballet. To the few who have complained about the fact that it's not showing things that are possible on stage, I feel only pity for those who are so habituated to the pretentiously ""realist"" styles favored in today's cinema that they won't let the cinema explore feelings and fantasy instead of the tiny portion of the human experience that actually exist within the limits of our field of vision. The point of showing the dance in the form of the dancer's impressions isn't simply to provide an interesting spectacle. It's also very important for the filmmakers to keep the focus on the artistic experience not as it would be experienced by the audience but rather as it would be experienced by the artist. In fact the audience itself becomes part of the impression, interpreted as the rolling waves of the sea. If they had not been able to accomplish this remarkable feat, the melodrama that develops  the conflict in Victoria's (Moira Shearer) heart between the domestic life offered by Julian Craster (Marius Goring) and the artistic one offered by Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook)  would feel just like a shallow exercise in romance. Instead we are made here to feel the romance that the stage offers for Victoria ourselves. It's impossible for the filmmakers to give that kind of personal access into the romantic affair with Julian, and perhaps they didn't really want to. Most ""backstage"" melodramas of this era end up heavily emphasizing the appeal of the romantic/domestic situation and to various extents demonize the practitioners of art and theater. But Lermontov is definitely a more complex character than most producers on film, and the way Powell/Pressburger have shown us the dance also compels one to favor the artistic option over the domestic one.The dancers in the film are all superb, particularly Leonide Massine, who makes every scene he's in a joy to watch even for this non-ballet fan. His performance is very good in the dramatic scenes as well, highly stylized but appropriate in the theater setting. For the most part however, in my opinion the actors don't really rise to the level of the material. Shearer came off the best even though in a few of the dramatic scenes her inexperience shows; the directors have carefully protected her screen image and manage to project a kind of fantasy of artistic achievement through her excellence in the dances to the point where we're inclined to accept her in other scenes. Perhaps in an effort to reassure us that Lermontov's emotional connection with art is real and powerful and not just an excuse for melodrama, the directors have included too many close-ups of Walbrook, making his performance feel more forced than it needs to. As for goring, I wasn't too impressed with him but I found the character so hard to empathize with that it's hard to say how much is his fault and how much just depends on what he was given  mostly very difficult scenes in carriages and boudoirs that he pulls off perhaps as best he could.These are small complaints in comparison to the quality of the whole work, and probably unavoidable given the need to accommodate some of the formula of melodrama, which this film doesn't so much subvert as it does personalize. When I was watching the movie, I was fascinated with every single frame. So to me the directors came off very well. A good example of excellent direction would be in the scene where dancer Irina Boronskaja (Ludmilla Tcherina) is introduced  from a slightly wider set-up showing several actors including Goring and then only a slight movement of the camera is necessary to bring Tcherina's face into almost full-frame close-up, and another movement (as I recall, no cuts, although there might be a subtle one) as we follow them up the stairs. The scene's kinetics specifically match the feel of her character and the way she contrasts with Victoria Page. Also the direction in the ballet sequence is extraordinary; this isn't just an impressive use of FX. I noted how the directors once again had to use only minimal camera movement and editing to alternate at various points between extreme close-ups of the actress' face and the movements of her body and the other dancers.A very impressive film that I hope to rewatch in the theater some day so that I can fully appreciate the style of the dynamics of these scenes."
"The creative force that was the Archers created a number of masterpieces, and this is probably the best known and the most influential. It's a sweeping blend of romance, drama, fairytale and tragedy, which was also a little-acknowledged great leap forward in the language of cinema.Powell and Pressburger had been experimenting with the musicality of their films for several years now, culminating in some brilliant, almost balletic moments in their previous picture Black Narcissus. With the Red Shoes however they created their first ""composed film"" as Powell described it in his autobiography. Music is an almost constant presence, and the imagery and movement always correspond to the music. The opening scene is a brilliant example (not to mention a great exercise in how to open a large-scale drama), in which the ballet performance going on all but ignored, but the music serves as a backdrop to introducing the characters and the interplay between them.The centrepiece of the whole picture is the performance of the Ballet of the Red Shoes itself. In a bold and completely unprecedented move the regular narrative entirely breaks off for a seventeen minute set piece that is both a genuine ballet performance and a piece of pure cinematic fantasy. On one level, it is a story within a story (Vicky's fate mirrors that of the heroine she plays). It is also a celebration of the possibilities of cinema, employing dozens of techniques (many of them harking back to the silent era) in order to enhance the ballet in ways that could never be done in a real performance. And yet it is never disrespectful to the older art form, as after all ballet bears a good deal of similarity to cinema, as it is story telling through music and movement.Although it's not technically a musical in the conventional sense, The Ballet of the Red Shoes certainly gave a massive boost to the evolution of the Hollywood musical. During the fifties few musicals were complete without a lengthy, slightly unreal dance sequence. Examples include the paintings-come-to-life sequence at the end of An American in Paris, or Gene Kelly's outlining of his ""Gotta Dance"" show in Singin' in the Rain. You can even see examples in the epic musical that began to appear later on  such as the ""Small House of Uncle Tom"" play in The King and I. The Ballet of the Red Shoes was the original inspiration for all these sequences, and is probably still the best.The ballet segment of The Red Shoes has also influenced successive generations of filmmakers in subtler ways. Not many would think there is a link between the Red Shoes and Martin Scorcese's violent boxing drama Raging Bull. However, Scorcese's mantra when shooting the boxing scenes was always ""stay inside the ring"". His aim was to show film the experience of the boxers, not show a tiny little ring from the audience's point-of-view. Thirty years earlier, Powell and Pressburger did the same thing with ballet. During that seventeen-minute sequence, the audience disappears, and the camera is inside the performance, not only showing us Vicky's point-of-view but also her hopes and fears through its expressionist techniques.Of course, most of these ideas had been explored before, perhaps most notably in the early Disney features which are constantly musical and merge fantasy and reality (Fantasia was a massive influence on Michael Powell). However, it's a lot harder to achieve the same effects with live action, and The Red Shoes brings back all those elements of exaggerated reality and cinema as a kind of dance which had been lost at the end of the silent era. It's also one of the earliest self-referential pieces of cinema, as it is an exploration of what it means to be a performer or a creator in a grand-scale collaborative artistic production.Talking of performers, The Red Shoes also features a nigh-on perfect cast. Marius Goring, who had already played several memorable supporting roles for the archers here gets a crack at a lead role, and does an absolutely brilliant job of it  it's a shame he never became a major star. Moira Shearer and Leonide Massine were hired mainly because they were world class ballet dancers, but their acting abilities were not far behind. Other Archers regulars like Robert Helpmann and Esmond Knight give good support, and Anton Walbrook is absolutely mesmerising as the Svengali Lermontov.The Red Shoes is one of cinema's absolutely perfect moments, without a single wrong note. Although its influence was everywhere, it remained something of a forgotten film itself for decades (typically for anything innovative or irregular, distributors regarded it as an expensive oddball), but fortunately all Michael Powell's films have recently been receiving a long overdue revival."
"In an era where nothing is sacred and corporate profits supercede personal worth, watching a movie as beautifully created and finely acted as this helps us remember how much beauty there really is around us.Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Red Shoes"" - a moral tale about a mischievous shoemaker who tempts a young girl or boy into buying the beautiful shoes, only to discover that they cause him/her to dance restlessly until he/she dies - is the metaphor central to this movie and plays itself out both in the movie's ballet masterpiece and the lives of the characters.The ballet company producer is a tortured and possessive man who wants to own the prima donna of the story in the same way that incomplete people want to own and absorb the beauty of something or someone else. But an off-stage romance between the leading lady and the genial composer leads to a rivalry of ownership and a seminal final scene where the Moira Shearer character is forced to choose between her husband or her dancing career.I gather this was a highly political movie of its time. Made in the years shortly after the war, it was probably an attempt by the British film-makers to make sense of the war's madness; this probably accounts for the looming Lermontov's possessiveness and ultimate destructiveness.However, not only the movie's plot line and beautiful direction appeals. Also, the moments when the movie depicts 1948 street life have an amazing effect on you. Seeing steam-trains and pleated summer dresses and reflections of a more innocent age all contribute to the movie's beauty and appeal."
"""The Red Shoes"" (1948) is a fantasy/musical/romance/drama set in the world of ballet and it could be possibly the best or one of the best ballet movies ever filmed. The red shoes of the title are from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale about a girl who tried the shoes on and possessed by their spell, dances to her death. The shoes gave her dance unearthly ethereal lightness and elegance and she paid with her own life for them. Andersen's fairy tale was transformed into a ballet in Michael Powell's and Emeric Pressburger's glorious film. 21-year-old Moira Shearer, the real life ballerina gave a heartbreaking and awe-inspiring performance as a ballet dancer Vicky Page for whom to dance meant to live and to live meant to dance. She never included love in the equation and one day she found herself trapped in the red shoes forever just like the girl from the ballet ""The Red Shoes"" that was written by a young composer with whom Vicky fell in love. The ballet was produced for the stage by a powerful talented world famous impresario Boris Lermontov (based on Sergey Diaghilev, the head of the celebrated Russian Seasons, as brilliant as he was tyrannical, played to perfection by Anton Walbrook). The short ballet is included in the movie and it is 15 minutes of unbearable perfection where colors, music and dance blend into unforgettable delight. When you watch dancing Shearer with her glowing red hair of rare shade that matches the color of the magic shoes you would want to capture the moment of beauty and keep it forever in the vaults of your memory.9.5/10"
"""The Red Shoes"" is set in the world of the ballet, and is a variation on the ""A Star is Born"" theme. Victoria Page, a promising young ballerina, joins the prestigious Ballet Lermontov as the protégée of its autocratic impresario Boris Lermontov. Under his tutelage she becomes a major star and dances the leading role in a new ballet he has commissioned, ""The Red Shoes"", based on a story by Hans Christian Andersen about a girl who dances herself to death after putting on a pair of magic shoes. Lermontov is an obsessive man for whom ballet is virtually a religion, and the requirements he makes on his dancers (at least the female ones) are quasi-religious. He believes that great art can only be produced by those who dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to it, which means that they must give up all other attachments, including love. When Victoria falls in love with, and marries Julian, the young composer who has written the music for ""The Red Shoes"", she is forced to choose between her love for him and her place with the company.The film is more than a simple melodrama about a girl forced to choose between the demands of love and those of art. I have never been convinced by Lermontov's theory that great art can only arise out of ascetic celibacy, if only because a casual glance at history will show that most great art, in all fields of artistic endeavour, has not been produced by celibate ascetics. In some cases it has been produced by those who were very far from being so. I doubt if Powell and Pressburger were convinced by the theory either- both were, after all, married. Although Lermontov is named after a great Romantic poet, his artistic credo is the precise opposite of that of the Romantics, who believed in the primacy of emotion in art and that strong emotions, particularly love, would supply the artist with inspiration.The film works on three levels. On one it is an exploration of the world of the ballet, a subject not often dealt with in the cinema. Even I (and I am far from being a balletomane) was fascinated by the lengthy dance sequences in the central part of the film. Secondly, on the metaphorical level it is an allegory of the artist's need to make personal sacrifices in order to achieve his or her goals. (Andersen's story was clearly chosen as the subject of the fictitious ballet because its theme parallels Victoria's own life). Thirdly, and on a more personal level, it is a psychological drama based around a variation on the ""eternal triangle"" theme.Unlike some reviewers I do not believe that Lermontov is gay. (That idea probably stems from the preconception that any man who takes an interest in ballet must be homosexual). Indeed, I believe that the film makes more psychological sense if one takes the view that he is heterosexual and that he is, on a subconscious level at least , in love with Victoria (just as he was previously in love with her predecessor as his prima ballerina, Irina, who also left the company when she married). He is unable or unwilling to make any direct romantic approaches towards her- possibly he does not recognise his subconscious feelings for what they are, or possibly he prefers her as a remote, idealised figure on a pedestal than as a real-life wife or mistress. Nevertheless, he is as jealous as if she were his real wife or mistress, and knows that she cannot be his ideal woman as the wife of another man. His ""art versus love"" theory can be seen as the sublimation of his own desires for her. It is notable that he does not take the same interest in the love-lives of any of his male stars, and although he admires Julian's work as a musician and is reluctant to lose his services, his relations with Julian do not have the emotional force of those with Victoria.Julian has little understanding of his wife's art- he describes ballet as a second-rate form of expression- but it is unfair to compare him, as one reviewer did to Angel Clare (the faithless husband in Hardy's ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles""). He never insists that Victoria should abandon ballet altogether- he merely insists that she should not work with Lermontov, whom he dislikes with good reason, seeing the older man as a threat to his marriage. Victoria's dilemma is that she believes that she needs Lermontov to inspire her creatively and that she could not reach the same heights of excellence with another ballet company. It is her inability to resolve this dilemma that leads to the film's tragic conclusion.Of the three main actors, I found that the weakest was Marius Goring as Julian. The lovely Moira Shearer, however, is enchanting as Victoria. Shearer was herself a ballerina who made her acting debut in this film. Anton Walbrook is excellent as Lermontov. It would have been easy to make him simply a bully out to ruin the happiness of two young people, but Walbrook invests him not only with dignity but also with a sense of pathos. At their best Powell and Pressburger were capable of producing work of the very highest quality, some of the best films ever made in Britain. (Walbrook also starred in two of their other great films, ""49th Parallel"" and ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp""). ""The Red Shoes"" is among their finest works. 9/10"
"I'm someone who knows close to zero about ballet. I was drawn to this film by its reputation. I will leave a detailed analysis of the film to other viewers who know its history. I'll just say that the staging of the actual ballet of  The Red Shoes' is brilliant. Powell and Pressberger have managed to take you into the subjective world of the dancers while keeping them on the stage. It is perhaps the finest cinematic representation of art's magical ability to transport the artist into another world. One note on the Criterion DVD transfer: while the color saturation is good, there seems to have been a problem with the timing. You can watch an actor's flesh tones change several times in the course of a few seconds (which is a little distracting). Given the great quality of Criterion's other transfers, I can only assume that this is a problem with the source material. The audio quality also suffers by comparison to modern standards.
But my complaints about the transfer do not diminish the accomplishments of Powell and Pressberger in turning the story of The Red Shoes' into a great ballet and a haunting metaphor about art, artists and sacrifice."
"I've been dreading a viewing of this, despite assurances that there wasn't too much dancing (there is!). Despite assurances that a viewer doesn't have to like dancing to like the movie. (You do (I do) & I didn't) Despite a review stating that the first 90 minutes were perfect (Am I watching the same movie everyone else is?). Despite assurances that this was an extraordinary movie and I would love it... I didn't. I really found this movie to be an unremarkable, overinflated beast.Despite a review that assured me this is the best Powell & Pressburger movie, all I saw was the standard harangue about Thee-uh-tuh people with all the clichés the footlights can brighten; a Svengali, a talented kid who just needs a chance to prove it. This is a boatload of clichés without the nuance I've come to expect from Powell & Pressburger. This is a movie with one measly idea, and it takes both too long to get to it, and too long to finish up.I was watching the clock for the entire first hour. I never found this movie the slightest bit engaging, because it repudiates everything that film does well. It's like taking the worst part of Oklahoma (the dream ballet) and making it three hours long. It reminded me of the quote ""Talking about music is like dancing about architecture,"" it may also be like reducing film to the conceits of the stage. Abstract ballet is still vital and compelling. Narrative ballet is about as relevant and heavy-handed as silent film, even when done by P&P, even with film tricks. Perhaps if I was an exceedingly girly thirteen year old... The only pleasure I got out of this was when I began fast-forwarding over gratuitous ballet performances and melodrama in the final hour.Any crappy movie can make you conclude, ""Gee, that was pretty."" It's a rare movie that makes you think. (about anything!) Powell/Pressburger films usually do. But this was exactly the movie I expected and dreaded. I know I'm in the minority but I found this movie fricking awful.The creepy effeminate bug-eyed dancer went on to be the creepy child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."
"I suspect MOST people who like this movie so much do so because they are fans of ballet. Those who are not fans are simply much less likely to watch it. I DON'T care for ballet, so I felt a little odd watching it. I know the movie has a fabulous reputation and there was a lot of good in it, but I used the DVD remote to speed through the long ballet scenes! I know, that makes me a Neanderthal, BUT considering MOST people probably feel about the same way about ballet, this review is intended for those people--not the die-hard fans! Okay--half the movie or so is ballet, so automatically it CAN'T be a great movie to some. But, what did I like? Well, the cinematography was gorgeous for 1948 and the acting was generally first-rate. But, the ending of the movie was a letdown because it seemed a bit silly and overwrought. Plus, I was REALLY hoping someone would punch that really pompous producer (Boris Lermontov) in the nose instead--now THAT would have been a great ending! So, in conclusion, if you LOVE ballet, this movie will make you go nuts because it is so wonderful. But, if you don't, you'll probably find yourself wondering WHY you decided to watch the movie in the first place!"
"The Red Shoes is what a dictionary is for: if you flip to any of those high remarks of comment: beautiful, gorgeous, hypnotic, daring, you may find the movie listed as a prime example. What Powell and Pressburger achieve with their film is a multi-faceted classic of art forms. There's dance, there's melodrama, there's sweeping production design, there's Technicolor, and there is the classical music performed to accompany the ballet. It crosses over from being just a movie about dance or a drama about dancers in love or even a movie about an obsessed ballet company director who can't stand to part with his prized possession into being a piece of art that can be enjoyed by anyone. Take it from me, the last place I would usually be found is at a ballet. But this is a movie I intend to see many times over in my lifetime.On the outset one (me) wondered if it would be much like the Hans Christen Anderson fable, about a woman who puts on red shoes and can't take them off and in the end, as the ballet impresario Boris Lermontov so simply puts it, ""she dies, that's it."" It is and it isn't. It starts off, for at least the first hour, looking like a version of the 1933 film 42nd Street (a theater company putting on a Broadway show) as it shows the taskmaster Lermontov prepare his next show, with the addition of a new composer, a young upstart Julian Craster (Goring), and a young woman Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) who impresses him with the very simple question to a question: ""Why do you want to dance?"" ""Why do you want to live?"" From then on Victoria, slowly but surely, becomes a fixation for Lermontov, putting her forward from the background of the line of dancers to front and center and then, ultimately, the main part of the Red Shoes, which he has Craster rewrite completely.We see how this one decision, one that Lermontov sees as just another part of his word-as-command motions, changes everything, for the better for Victoria and Julian as artists and in their careers (and as lovers), and for worse for Lermontov. Conventional wisdom would think that Lermontov, as performed by the dark-eyed and deviously subtle Walbrook, is jealous and wants Victoria all to herself romantically. This is not correct, though it's fair to think that as it's invited to expect it. Powell and Pressburger subvert this expectation by emphasizing how much Lermantov wants Victoria not for love but for, quite the opposite of Julian, his own sort of creation. ""Do you want to be the greatest dancer in the world?"", he basically asks Page point blank? Her response is, simply, yes, without even thinking about it. What is most intriguing is not even so much how Lermontov acts but how Victoria does, too. For every artistic quasi puppet master, frankly, there is probably a puppet somewhere.And while the story of this strange love-not-love triangle takes us along - and, first and foremost, Powell and Pressburger are consummate storytellers of a near perfectionist nature within their studio-bound limits - it becomes like a fable unto itself. It borrows from Hans Christen Anderson mostly for its centerpiece, which is the actual Red Shows ballet production on stage. This is such a staggering set-piece because it transcends the stage and the audience (we never see the audience itself, a contrast to the opening of the film where we mostly saw audience and little dancing), and becomes just pure cinema. Powell and Pressburger invite- no, demand, that you watch and be absorbed by how Victoria Page becomes absorbed into this world of the Red Shoes, and the sets and color palette reflects this, not to mention how characters go and transform into others (she sees Julian and Boris transform at one point, and then Julian on stage with her). It's so immediate and passionate and awe-inspiring that you could watch it over and over for a week and not attain all of the layers of craftsmanship and style. Only the climax of Singin' in the Rain tops it for sheer spectacle and heart-thrilling magnitude, and just barely.It borrows from the fable for that, yes, but also towards the end of the film it becomes all the more clear that it is in fact a real-life fairy tale, which makes it all the more frightening and haunting. Victoria may be trapped forever in her own ambitions, and the metaphor of the title is just far too much, and the inevitable happens (it's not spoiling since, frankly, it is part of the original fable). And yet most remarkable is that one knows that the film is only in part, on the surface, about this (putting it lightly) ambitious woman with fiery red hair and a determined face in love with this equally brilliant composer. It's really about something deeper, more elemental to people in general. Critics often cite the exchange between Victoria and Boris about dancing and living that I mentioned earlier in this review as a key moment, but the one for me is at another point in the film. The exchange happens between Boris and one of his stagehands: ""You can't alter human nature."" ""No? I think you can do even better then that. You can ignore it!""Throughout the film, we see human nature put up on the screen, as vibrant and as beautiful and (sometimes) disturbing as anything else in movies, and how Boris is doomed precisely because of his ignoring nature of what people really are. And it's his conflict, his ultimate demise, that makes the film so tragic and elevates it from being tawdry melodrama or just another ballet movie. Quite frankly, unless something of a sucker punch comes along, I don't need to see another 'ballet movie' for quite a long while, if ever."
"This movie was a relief to watch. Its not a movie where the dancing makes you sick. It is beautifully made with great costumes, locations, dance numbers, and music. Having shot in Technicolor makes the film even more like a painting. The colors are all vibrant and captivating making it hard to keep your eyes away from any outside or stage location.The film also is an inspirational piece. With the main actor pushing his performers to be the best they can be it has a strong statement, one that is said often. you can't accomplish your dreams by doing nothing, you have to get out there and do something about it. Don't let your talent go to waste. We live this through the Ballerina as she is pushed to her limits.This is a fun romantic drama to watch."
"The Red Shoes (1948): Starring Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring, Leonide Massine, Ludmilla Tcherina, Robert Helpman, Albert Basserman, Esmond Knight, Jean Short, Gordon Littman, Julia Lang, Joy Rawlins, Bill Shine, Austin Trevor, Eric Berry, Irene Brown, Jerry Verno, Derek Elphinstone, Marie Rambert, Yvonne Andre And Ballerinas And Danseurs Of Massine's Company Directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, Screenplay Keith Winter Released in 1948 and directed by the creative British duo directors Powell and Pressburger (of Black Narcissus fame), ""The Red Shoes"" is a brilliant film of the early Techicolor Era (1939-1959). More than that, it is a powerful art-house film with the theme of perfectionism, art and human feelings/love. Ballerina turned actress Moira Shearer, who died only recently, stars as Victoria Page, who quickly rises from the ranks of the lower-level dancers to star ballerina with the guidance of the imperious, cold and demanding impresario and ballet master Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook in a great performance). The relationship between them is at the heart of the film, much more so than the later relationship she develops with music composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring), with whom she falls in love. This love triangle is played out amidst the world of ballet in the 40's, directly after World War II, when such names as Leonide Massine and later on George Balanchine would become legend. Leonide Massine appears in this film as the exotic dancer Grischa Ljubov, basically a parody of himself. Ballerina Ludmilla Tcherina, herself a well-known name at the time, appears as Russian ballerina Irina Boronskaya, parodying herself as well. Shot on location in London, Paris and Monte Carlo, we follow the course of Vicky Page's phenomenal career in ballet. Again, the moving story and the stunning cinematography, make this a wonderful film of the 40's and a treasure of Technicolor. At times, the film borders on dreamy romantic escapism, as Vicky Page suddenly finds herself living the very life of the tragic character she portrays in the new and original ballet ""The Red Shoes"" adapted from the old Danish fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson. In that tale, a ballerina puts on a pair of magic red shoes made by an eccentric shoemaker without realizing they are cursed, damning her to dance to her death. This original ballet is performed in the film, full of surreal nightmarish elements and breathtaking beauty, particularly in the choreographed dancing. The parallel between the fictional heroine she portrays and the actual woman is dramatic and ironic. Soon, Vicky Page becomes the object of Lermontov's obsession and repressed romantic love. She must choose between a normal life with Julian, whom she truly loves, or a life in the glamorous but physically demanding world of ballet. Anton Walbrook, especially, carries the film with his performance as Lermontov, who is a ballet slave-driver, making stars out of young girls and prioritizing art for art's sakes. He renounces love for himself and for his dancers for love makes them distracted and bad dancers. Coincidentally, in the Paris Opera of today, this sentiment remains."
"One of the great ""dance"" movies, The Red Shoes combines several great dance sequences with a behind the doors look at the machinations of a dance company headed by a despotic director.Moira Shearer makes an astounding film debut in this lush and beautiful film. Not only can Shearer dance, but she's beautiful and she can act. And she's central to the plot where the director (Anton Walbrook) spars with rising composer (Marius Goring) over her attentions. Fascinating scripts examines the tensions and rivalries among a group of highly talented and highly strung artists.Supporting cast includes Albert Bassermann as the set decorator, Leonid Massine and Robert Helpmann as dancers, and Ludmilla Tcherina as the temperamental prima ballerina. The acting is stylized and emotive in a hammy way but it works.The Red Shoes Ballet is one of the great dance pieces in all film. The music is wonderful, and the story draws you in. The only flaw is that Goring is 10 years too old (at 36) to be the ""young composer."" Shearer made only a handful of films but will always be remembered as the glorious Victoria Page in The Red Shoes."
"""The Red Shoes"" is a magnificent film, the jewel in the crown of Powell and Pressburger. I have to believe that since the film was first released, thousands of young women have wanted to become ballet dancers.This vibrantly-colored movie concerns a gifted ballerina (the impossibly beautiful Moira Shearer) whom two men want to possess - the head of the ballet company, Lermentov, brilliantly portrayed by Anton Walbrook (perhaps one of the great castings of a role of all time) - and a composer, Julian (Marius Goring, whom I've never liked in the part). She gives up her career to be with Julian, which as far as I'm concerned, was a big mistake. Lermentov believes you can't have it all; you have to marry your career.The centerpiece of the film is the exciting, elaborate ""Red Shoes"" ballet, which is an allegory for Victoria's own life. Shearer is wonderful in the role, though she has always said she wished she danced better. As a bit of trivia, she was part of the Sadler's Wells Ballet when it came to the U.S. after the film was released. The prima ballerina was Margot Fonteyn. Guess who got all the attention? You can see Victoria in her gowns a million times and always have a sharp intake of breath. You can watch the ballet a million times and never cease to be thrilled by it. You can watch the ending a million times and always be touched by it. So it is with this beautiful film, which played in London for four years."
"I just viewed this film on Turner Classic Network. I'd heard and read about it many times over the years (it's a sure sign that a film wants to be seen by you when you keep reading or hearing about it!) but it took me much too long to finally see it. I plan on owning this film by tomorrow morning.I wish I'd seen The Red Shoes (1948) when I was younger because it is a masterwork. In this film, there are no American movie stars - which is what I most love about films from the Golden Age. The winning charisma of Fred and Gene and Ginger and Rita and Betty is not to be found. Instead, this film has a dreamlike cast that brings a classical aesthetic sensibility to the presentation of music and dance. The beautiful, tortured, God-given talents of Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring et al infuse this film with a tragic, romantic artistry that I have never experienced in any other film.This film inspires. The special effects that were used to heighten the drama of the ballet sequence are as sensational today as they MUST have been 50+ years ago. I discovered my higher self while watching this film. Some people might say it's too grand, too histrionic but I feel that truly great artists - dancers and musicians - are compelled by the same divine madness that possess the characters of The Red Shoes.Please see this film, for yourself, for your children, for the future of cinema."
"Early on in THE RED SHOES (1948), ballet company director Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) encounters tiny, young flame-haired dancer Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) at the refreshments table after a spellbinding evening of ballet. Walbrook, half-interested, half-annoyed, asks her what seems a throwaway question ""Why do you want to dance?"". The young girl considers him for a moment and coolly retorts ""Why do you want to live?"" Clearly taken aback, Walbrook replies ""I don't know why exactly...but somehow I must"". For Victoria Page, his answer describes her exact feelings towards dancing. And so THE RED SHOES (1948) follows Vicki's journey from ambitious unknown to famous ballerina, and her inability to separate the lure of art from real life.The entire production is a triumph. Powell and Pressburger, British cinema's finest collaborators in the 1940's, weave a dazzling interpretation of Andersen's story of The Red Shoes. Their regular cinematographer, the still-living Jack Cardiff, films the action in dazzling Technicolour. The sets and compositions of every scene are a masterwork- it all adds up to near-perfection. The technical wizardry is topped off by the stunning ballet sequences, most notably the mid-way set piece 'The Ballet Of The Red Shoes'. American imitators such as he Gene Kelly films ON THE TOWN (1949) and AN American IN Paris (1951) would try and replicate THE RED SHOES'(1948) re-telling of the larger story through dance, yet the THE RED SHOES (1948) stands alone.Aside from the vast technical achievements, THE RED SHOES (1948) is also astonishing for the level of engagement it provides with it's plot and characters. Shearer is amazing and entirely convincing as Vicki, caught between her artistic passion for the wondrous, almost-mythical Lermontov ballet company and her all too human love for composer Marius Goring. Walbrook is equally perfect in his role, making what should be a typically villainous, repulsive character infinitely watchable and almost sympathetic. The central love story behind THE RED SHOES (1948) ends in tragedy, yet one can forget the inevitable anguish of it's final moments for the glimpses of consuming romantic passion between ""Romeo"" Julian and ""Juliet"" Vicki, dreamily drifting through the night together in a carriage."
"All the glories of this film have been articulated many times by more able commentators, so I'll just add that I still find it a powerful emotional experience. Considering how silly certain aspects of it are, when given any kind of careful thought (Shearer herself asserted the falseness of its central dichotomy between artist and lover), the sheer power of its vision overcomes any rational objection. In other words, it by-passes the mind and heads straight for the heart, which pretty much defines the word Romantic. And this is a great piece of Romantic art.Even so, the film's portrayal of the hierarchical, disciplined world of ballet has an authentic ring, as do the passions of its inhabitants, superbly and sympathetically played by the likes of Albert Basserman and Esmond Knight. The central trio are totally wonderful - I really don't think Marius Goring did anything better in his long career, and Shearer must have surpassed all expectations of her as an actress. For Anton Walbrook, praise is not enough: it is one of the great performances of cinema - the sheer accomplishment in those quicksilver changes of mood and scale invite comparisons with only the very very best.For those behind the camera, again, the highest possible praise, not least for that amazing central ballet sequence. Hein Heckroth's designs, Reginald Mills' editing, Jack Cardiff's cinematography - are all awe-inspiring: who can possibly forget images like the auditorium, as seen from the back of the stage, flooded with waves, confronting Shearer, as Goring conducts? Breath-taking stuff! And Easdale's music is excellent: essentially a melange of the three great ballet composers of the first half of the 20th century - Stravinsky, Bartok and Ravel - it presses all the right buttons at the right time, notably in the ""Red Shoes"" theme itself, which is perfect.Because of the nagging sense of silliness, I had wondered whether 9 out of 10 would be more appropriate, but when confronted with the sheer grandeur of this film, the breadth of the vision behind it, the scale of ambition matched to its complete realisation - it has to be full marks."
"Powell and Pressburger's movie about the young dancer moulded into a great ballerina by a Svengali-like impresario is a a masterpiece. Everything about the film is heightened from the superlative use of colour to the deliberately melodramatic score to the performances. Anton Walbrook is magnificent as Lermontov, the impresario and the dancer Moira Shearer is extraordinarily beautiful and touching as the girl.The Red Shoes ballet itself is a classic example of something that could only be achieved in the cinema and on a sound stage and not in the theatre and is, perhaps, the highpoint of Powell and Pressburger's work. The intimate details, too, of backstage life has meant that the film has dated not a jot. Psychologically, of course, the film's study of jealously and madness is novelettish at best but is in perfect keeping with the nature of the story. Like the potency of cheap music this riot of colour stirs the emotions in the ways many more subtle films could never do."
"Victoria Page is an up-and-coming young ballet dancer, seemingly headed for superstardom. She has just landed a great role, in the ballet The Red Shoes, a role that gets even better when the lead ballerina leaves and she replaces her. However, things get complicated when she falls in love with the composer of The Red Shoes. This does not sit well with the ballet's director...I really don't know what all the fuss was about. Maybe it's because I am not a huge fan of ballet, or just found all the goings-on rather pretentious, and over-dramatic, but this movie was OK, not great. Plot is pretty conventional, though drawn out. Direction is good though, for its time. Acting is like something out of a soap opera. The only plus in the casting is the beauty of Moira Shearer."
"A young ballerina (Moira Shearer) becomes a great star but comes under stress when torn between love and her career.Never was a better film made from such a plain story so unpersuasively written and performed; the splendour of the production is in the intimate view it gives of life backstage in the ballet world with its larger-than-life characters. The ballet excerpts are very fine, and the colour distinctive; the whole film is charged with excitement.Although loosely based on the Andersen story, it was also said to have been inspired by the real-life meeting of Sergei Diaghilev with the British ballerina Diana Gould. Diaghilev asked her to join his company, but he died before she could do so. Diana Gould later became the second wife of Yehudi Menuhin."
"Okay,I admit it...I'm not the biggest ballet person (although I can respect it as an art form). However,this did not sway me one bit from enjoying 'The Red Shoes',one bit. The story concerns a young,up & coming ballerina,Victoria Page (played by Moira Shearer),who wants nothing more than to dance in the legendary Lermontov dance company. When good fortune drops in her lap,she joins the company. She has to win the admiration of it's founder,Boris Lermontov (played to the nine's by Anton Walbrook),who is shrewd,controlling,calculating,but wants nothing more than to have the best dance company in all of Europe. When a young English composer,Julian Craster (Marius Goring) becomes the new conductor/music arranger/composer of the company,potential romantic sparks fly between him & Victoria,much to the chagrin of Boris,who also has an eye for pretty,young Victoria. All of this makes for splendid drama. One of the high points of the film is a ballet rendition of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale,The Red Shoes,with an original musical score by Craster. All of this makes for a beautifully filmed event (shot in the old I.B. non fading Technicolor process by Jack Cardiff),with superb editing by Reginald Mills. The production design,by Hein Heckroth & art direction by Arthur Lawison conjures up a dreamy,surreal look to it (especially during the Red Shoes ballet sequence,that reminds one of some of the films of Jean Cocteau,at times). The rest of the cast turn in bravura roles. Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger co direct from a screenplay written by Pressburger & Keith Winter. What I really admired is that this film reminded me of another film from the same era (Childern Of Paradise),which concerned people in the performing arts,their lives & loves,and the sacrifices they make for their art. Perfect film entertainment for the whole family. Currently making the rounds in a superb,brand spanking new 35mm print,with restored Techicolor (overseen by Martin Scorsese,and others)on the revival/art house circuit. Not rated by the MPAA,but contains absolutely nothing to offend"
"The Red Shoes is another favorite story from the pen of Hans C. Andersen, though it is a very sad story. Now I had seen various promo pictures for this film and I had gotten curious. I wanted to see the film and I did on TCM. And then, I taped it too.The version of the story for this film, is about a woman named Victoria (Vicky) Page who dances in the Lermontov Ballet Co. After dancing the leading in the ballet version of the fairytale, she rose to ballerina fame. Until she fell for the ballet's composer Julian Craster. And when they married, the ballet's director Boris Lermontov got angry about it, and scornfully relents his decision to enforce Vicky's contract, and permits her to dance where and when she pleases. The one exception is The Red Shoes: Lermontov retains the rights to the ballet and ownership of Julian's music, and refuses to mount it again or allow anyone else to produce the ballet. So, I won't give you anymore details, you'll have to see the film for yourself. Also I hated the cold-hearted bastard Lermontov.I thought ""The Red Shoes"" ballet is the best part of the film. And overall, I love this film from beginning to end."
"Coming from the Powell-Pressburger team you shouldn't be surprised. This is not only one of the best dance films ever, is THE film about artists. It tells the story of a unknown ballerina (Moira) who becomes who is between the love of two possessive men: A composer and famous ballet producer. Art imitates life.The movie could take the Anderson beautiful tale in form as Powell do with THE TALES OF Hoffman or maybe what Bergman do with THE MAGIC FLUTE, but Powell-Pressburger uses the tale as a metaphor of the future confrontation of our leading lady between her life, her job or her love. And the ending is a heart breaker. And are the Technicolor sets and, what it could be the typical MGM musical long dance sequence is masterful, beautiful scene that keep your senses out of orbit.A MUST. A CLASSIC. Though Criterion Collection can be observed as an easy choice with their fame, their print is definitely not the best (Actually is kind of poor) ... There's an European edition that, it seems, contains the best negative."
"If you think you shouldn't watch The Red Shoes because of the ballet you will be amazed. If you think it will be old-fashioned and boring you will be amazed.Ever since I saw this aged 5 it has been a family favourite. My three daughters love this and watch it over and over again, my brother and I sit together with our parents and watch this at Christmas . it is simply stunning, exhilarating, and above all full of the spirit of life.The struggle to create great art that consumes all involved is eternal, and the way the film is directed is faultless. Yes it is stylized but if you watch with open eyes and an open heart you are guaranteed an experience to last a lifetime.More than just a classic of the cinema it is a brilliant tale that genuinely makes the soul sing in a way that even Anchors Aweigh, and Fame, and Top Hat do not.Highest recommendation possible - one of THE films to see before you die."
This film is a terrific achievement shot in technicolor in 1948. About a young ballet dancer called Victoria Page who is torn between being a world class ballet dancer and the man she loves. There are some beautiful dance sequences particularly one in the middle of the film that goes for 15 minutes. The film is beautifully directed and cheoregraphed. The music is exceptional and high class. The acting is also very strong. This is one of the best films ever made. A great achievement.
"The cinematography is visually astonishing and the ballet sequences are beautifully choreographed. The acting is superb. The one problem with the film that I found is that the two main characters' romance to be rather disinteresting. Nevertheless, it is a classic."
"THE RED SHOES tells the tragic story of two people and their selfless love for each other and their respective passion in an egocentric world. A world which is phony, mendacious und destructive in it's very nature. A world in which authority is inextricably linked with seeming infallibility. A cold world in which talent, skills and people are just a commodity und not met with artistic respect.THE RED SHOES is equally a celebration and a swan song of art und the people running the art world. It's about the superficiality of the profound and about how it all doesn't matter in the face of love."
"If there is a poll of the most factitiously gorgeous movies of all time, Powell-Pressburger's THE RED SHOES will no doubt be surmounted on the top tier, for its kaleidoscopic use of Technicolor, highlighting the minutiae of its personages' fine complexion under sublime warpaint, carrying on to a fairyland luster that reflects the center story, and most extraordinarily, its scenography of phantasmagoria and spectacle, conjured up by art director Hein Heckroth. Certainly, for highbrow spectators, THE RED SHOES is an absolute humdinger even it is just for its eponymous ballet piece, written by Brian Easdale, choreographed by Robert Helpmann and headlined by a virtuoso Moira Shearer, this Hans Christian Andersen inspired magic tragedy has been roundly integrated into the narrative, where a budding prima ballerina Vicky Page (Shearer) is torn by her hankering to play her bespoke showpiece and the secular love with Julian Craster (Goring), a promising composer, and the blockade is set by the ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Walbrook), who has discovered Vicky in the first place, and loathes whoever dares to blemish the purity of devotion to art by falling into that profane thing called love, already he has instantly dismissed another ballerina Irina (Tchérina) when she delightfully apprises the news that she is going to get married, so both Vicky and Julian should have known better.First of all, the ever-dapper Austrian actor Anton Walbrook effuses a superb air of condescension, complacency and cruelty that gives to the propulsion that the lax plot needs the most, calibrating every line and gesticulation with tacit investment of Boris' warped tunnel vision, he runs rings around his co-star Shearer and Goring as inhabiting ""the man with no heart"" with unyielding determination, he is at once obnoxious and fascinating. The fascination must be dialed down towards the ill-sorted pair, Ms. Shearer, is a fabulous dancer but not exactly what one might call as a supreme hyphenate, and even under the slap, furrows materializes on the face of Goring, who was 36 years old and looks like a doppelgänger of Dirk Bogarde (who would be a perfect Julian at a tender age of 27) to this reviewer's eyes, then yet has to play a sapling, so it is somewhat grating to see he is constantly referred as a ""young man"" by Irina (Tchérina is only 24), premature senility prevails, and that is not to say he is given much to do as the thankless fodder who bewitches Vicky into wedlock and cannot let her embrace the glory she yearns. Whereas viewers are showering in divine immersion of the most astonishing craftsmanship ever been executed on the screen, the discrepancy between its visual-and-aural extravaganza and a hoary, faintly incoherent (no effort is made to emphasize what the titular ballet means to Vicky, for instance) and evasive (unpunished plagiarism needs some scathing condemnation here) script only mars the ascension of THE RED SHOES as an irrefutable chef d'oeuvre that creates a harmonious symbiosis of cinema and ballet, and by the time they launch another attempt in THE TALES OF HOFFMANN (1951), the duo's mojo has drastically faded."
"Not as dark, yet definitely as disturbing as Black Swan. I had no idea what's this movie about, or what to expect of it. All I had known about this movie before watching is that it's hailed as one of the best-looking movies ever, and I couldn't agree more. This movie was shot in three-strip Technicolor, and it doesn't just look good for its time, but it dazzles and mesmerizes as if it was shot this year! It is simply one of the most beautiful movies to date. The Red Shoes is a visual carnival full with vibrant, and consistent colors that will easily captivate you as well as its characters. From the first scene I could see that the characters would be fully fleshed-out at the end of the movie. Powell and Pressburger's screenplay, who also directed the movie, gave our three main characters a lot of depth that they can be analyzed, while also balancing between them, and that by making them equally important to the main plot. Each one of the main characters has their own subplots, but I never felt there's a subplot that seems forced, or outbalance another. That wouldn't be achieved without the impeccable direction that walks a thin line between quirkiness and darkness. 
 
The theatrical performances are completely intentional. They make me feel uneasy because the subject matter is so dark and serious. These contradictory moods made the movie painful and disturbing in its own way. Maybe in a way that kinda resembles dark comedies. You'll know that such decision is appropriate when the credits roll. You'll get a very agonizing and maddening feeling! Anton Walbrook delivered one of the best over-the-top performances ever as Boris Lermontov, a very complex, and compelling character that is hard to be understood.
The only hammy performance that I couldn't stand is Ludmilla Tchérina's. What a highly melodramatic! It's really unbearable and annoying. Between all the theatrical performances, this just feels off, and awkward. 
Marius Goring and Moira Shearer gave fantastic and appealing performances. 
Grischa, played by Leonide Massine, was such a very interesting character; he is the comic-relief, but it's a character that seems if it is came out of a literary work. It made me see all the other characters differently. I saw them as I saw Grischa; fictional literary characters, and it really made sense! Grischa was the key that made me see how Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger blur the barriers between cinema and literature, or theater, in a very smooth way. Powell and Pressburger proved that cinema is a real magic, and ""The Red Shoes"" ballet sequence is more than a fine example. I won't be exaggerate, even a little bit, if I said that this 15-min-long sequence is one of, if not the most enthralling and spellbinding sequences ever shot! 15 minutes of visual storytelling at its best. I was just hypnotized, and I wish it would never end. The Red Shoes is also masterfully edited. In fact, the editing is one of the main reasons this movie is timeless. The switching between one scene to another is very slick and smooth; however, there are many continuity editing glaring errors. Despite how simple this issue seems, I found that it's so obvious, and quite annoying, that I can't avoid mentioning it. All I can say is that The Red Shoes is an idiosyncratic piece of work that will never age.(9/10)"
Very beautiful and inspiring film. I'm very impressed by the choreography and music and a great acting game.
"The story of a young ballerina (Moira Shearer) and young composer (Marius Goring) being accepted into a ballet company and then working their way up by demonstrating their skills to an irascible producer (Anton Walbrook) is decent in its own right, and the first half of this film gives us a 'behind the scenes' look into the making of a ballet, with a set of charming supporting characters. What sets the film apart, however, is the actual production of the ballet, which directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger give us in a visually stunning extended sequence, using various film effects to enhance its dreamy feeling. You don't have to be a lover of ballet to appreciate the artistic beauty of these scenes, and it's no wonder the film won Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Score. Shearer being asked to choose between a husband and a career may be a little maddening and sound familiar to women, but the demand is not from her husband, it's from her producer. The ballet shoes that she puts on which promise worldwide fame are a bit of a Faustian bargain, with Walbrook's character Mephistopheles. It gets a bit melodramatic as it plays out, but it's always entertaining. Strong performances, strong direction, and fantastic artistry."
"I was reminded of this film when i watched a modern ballet series called Flesh and Bones. The Red Shoes was mentioned in many of the reviews. I had watched this film years ago, and decided to revisit it. What can you say really, the dancing in the middle was simply breathtaking and Moira Shearer such a wonderful dancer. The impresario takes a young ballerina under his wing. In Flesh and Bones we have the same with the director who takes a young ballet dancer under his wing. Both of these characters were like Svengali, and demanded much of the dancers to the point of excluding them a life outside of the dance. Even the premise was similar The Red Shoes a fairy tale, and for me I found Flesh and Bones was a dark and disturbing fairy tale of a young troubled dancer escaping her life and being finally set free by the Knight who slays the dragon. The one difference was for me it was so innocently produced, no horrific graphical sexual scenes covering such things as incest and sodomy.The story ended as the Ballet The Red Shoes came to life. It was quite sad at the ending and i must admit I did shed a tear or two on both of them. I would recommend this film to youngsters who love the ballet, even with dramatic content. The dancing was simply superb the scenery at times breath taking, and i actually felt sorry for the Impresario as i felt he actually was in love with Moria Shearers character, and used her love for the ballet to come back to him."
"British cinema often gets criticised for its so-called narrow milieu, be it historical/period dramas, feel-good comedies, social realism & gangster films. The films of Powell & Pressburger stand apart, distinctive in the English canon, the artistic marriage in this post-Brexit age of an English maverick (eccentric individualism) to the European sensibility of the émigré Pressburger. Their retinue (such as the cinematography of Jack Cardiff) produced films that are imaginative, passionate, full of dramatic power & beauty. What struck me about 'The Red Shoes', their wonderful modern take on Andersen's tragic fairy-tale, is how ravishing it must have looked to a post-war audience worn down by war & still enduring rationing. A film cannot fill an empty stomach, but the cinematography, the bright colours & exotic locales must have been a feast for the eyes, art as both escapism & entertainment.The story is elegantly structured with the ballet segment 'The Red Shoes', a stand-alone piece on its own as entertainment but which reflects the story set in the present (Lermontov as the shoe-maker who entices the girl to wear the red shoes, the circus represents international fame). Vicky & Julian are introduced, both overcoming initial obstacles to their dreams, then begin to impress the stern task-master Lermontov before fate offers them a chance to finally realise their ambitions.'The Red Shoes' is the story of a young woman who dreams of becoming a celebrated ballerina, though in the background hovers the whisper of 'be careful what you wish for'. It is the story of Vicky's relationship with two men & the eventual conflict which sees them wrest for control of her.Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) is a fascinating character, portrayed as darkly charismatic, detached & cynical, an aesthete, a Diaghilev-svengali type of figure, who runs a world famous ballet company. He is obsessed with art to the point that he demands absolute loyalty to its precepts, even to the extreme where he denies the human, which, in itself, is a contradiction because art is in itself the deepest expression of the self, of our selves & what it is to be human. He is a control freak (the miniature ballet stage on his desk in Paris), one of the ballets referenced in a montage is 'Coppelia' based on Hoffmann, a tale about a diabolical inventor & his mechanical doll. Vicky, too, makes a diabolical pact with the Mephistophelian Lermontov as he & his travelling ballet company casts its spell over her. It will also demand a human sacrifice (Rites of Spring). In the same Paris office, a slightly sinister plaster-cast sculpture of a ballerina's foot anticipates the tragic ending.Julian Craster, in a less obvious way, also mistreats Vicky. He is impetuous & passionate, perhaps representing the emotions. Together, Craster & Lermontov produce a masterpiece & platform for Vicky's talent. After his marriage to Vicky, he returns to his work as he cannot resist the creative impulse, but fails to realise that she, too, has a need for self-expression. Both Lermontov & Craster deny Vicky her individuality: the first views her as his creation, demanding absolute loyalty, the other views her as his muse, subservient to his wishes.The ending is poignant, the ghostly last performance of 'The Red Shoes' & Vicky's final haunting request."
"The technicolour cinematography was outstanding.My only complaint would be that the performance of The Red Shoes in the middle went on too long, and as someone who isn't too big on ballet I got bored during this scene.Characters were really well developed and the performances were great. Extremely well written film. The ending was quite shocking to be honest, didn't really see coming. It felt very modern for a film made in 1948 as well, not dated at all.I'd easily give this a 9/10, and perhaps on a rewatch maybe a RARE tg-esque 10/10!"
"For years I had heard of how many directors had been influenced by the 1948 film by directing team Michael Powell, and Emeric Pressburger. The story about a young ballet dancer who wants nothing else in the world than to dance, until she meets her first true love is set against a beautiful score and glorious Technicolor. Starring Moira Shearer & Anton Walbrook The Red Shoes is a remarkable classic and one that the audience is fortunate enough to have restored for years worth of enjoyment. Martin Scorsese, one of the notable directors to have been inspired towards filmmaking because of the film The Red Shoes, had the film restored with painstaking detail, then screened at Cannes in 2009; audiences owe a great deal to his efforts for guaranteeing the film lives on nearly 70 years after its release.Victoria Page is a young dancer absolutely smitten with ballet, believing it to be the reason she is on planet earth; what else is life but to dance, she often ponders. When she meets, quite by chance, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) a well-known ballet impresario of a famous ballet company, she sees her dreams finally coming true when given a chance to dance in his company. The catch with Mr. Lermontov is that he requires full devotion from his dancers. Mr. Lermontov even becomes enraged when the young dancers in his troupe become engaged and leave dancing to build families. Mr. Lermontov demands fierce loyalty of those who work for him, in exchange, he gives them a chance to become world renown dancers and an unlimited artistic potential for their craft. Victoria has no problem devoting herself to Mr. Lermontov because she sees no other purpose in life but to dance. She is living her dream and gaining notoriety as one of Mr. Lermontov's dancers, especially when she dances The Red Shoes Ballet. It is through her quest for perfection, however, that Vicky grows to know The Red Shoes composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring). After working together to make sure the ballet is perfect, the two grow to love each other, earning the wrath of Mr. Lermontov. Seeing that his next star ballerina is no longer solely loyal to him, he fires Julian, which leads to the resignation of Victoria Page. Torn between her love and being loyal to Julian and her devotion to her craft, Victoria Page must decide if marriage and true love will overrule what she believes to be her reason for life, ballet dancing.This film is every bit of the perfection I have always been told that it is. The pacing is perfect, enrapturing the audience from the opening scene of young people rushing into watch a ballet of Mr. Lermontov's. The camera work utilized in The Red Shows was nothing short of incredible. The turning cameras as Victoria dances, the close ups on the posters announcing each ballet, the panning of the cameras as the red shoes are being selected for the ballet, and the brilliant overlays all go to show the directorial prowess of Powell, and Pressburger. What brings the whole film together is the character of Boris Lermontov. The character that may be one of the most wonderfully complex characters to ever grace the screen, Anton Walbrook played the part with extreme skill. The God-like character of Mr. Lermontov brimming with his various frustrations that can not easily be named is a fantastic illustration of good filmmaking. The character demanded loyalty and was so careful to present the image that he was secure in himself and self-assured, yet overwhelmed with questioning doubts of his worth after the curtains of his ballets dropped. It wasn't simply sexual frustrations that enraged Mr. Lermontov when his dancers left him, there seemed to be a deep abandonment complex that filled his soul, that the audience is never fully made aware of, and oddly, that lack of knowledge is forgivable. We don't have to know why Lermontov is how he is, we're simply blessed with the opportunity to examine such a brilliantly complex character. The Red Shoes gives audiences a chance to explore beautifully intricate characters, witness gorgeous shots, and coloration, and see a magical retelling of a grim Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, a chance we should never pass up. Whether you are a fan of ballet or not, The Red Shoes is a film anyone can not only enjoy, but grow from."
"'The Red Shoes' directed and written by the legendary British filmmaking duo Powell-Pressburger is very often called the greatest ballet film or even the greatest dance film of all time. After watching this, I can understand why. The screenplay written by Emeric Pressburger takes inspiration from the fairy tale of the same name written by Hans Christian Andersen and it employs the story within the story technique. The storyline of the film is pretty simple but effective. We are introduced to three principal characters namely Victoria 'Vicky' Page, Boris Lermontov and Julian Craster played by Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook and Marius Goring respectively. The film can be in a basic sense described as a love triangle between the three with the seductive ghost of dancing hovering over all of them. In a way it is a horror film too, because the central theme is something that many artists have or will face in their real lives. What do you choose between your personal life and your art? This is the question that this film asks. Even if you choose one over the other, the option that you abandon will continue to haunt you. This particular issue is beautifully conveyed visually in a long uninterrupted shot of Victoria and Julian in their bedroom towards the end of the film.The acting is good from everyone. Moira Shearer's performance off the stage when she isn't dancing is good, but when she is dancing on stage, she just becomes this almost heavenly figure with unending grace, elegance and charisma. Marius Goring is also good as this talented young composer who is eager to make his mark and won't stop till he gets what he wants. But for me the stand-out performance comes from Anton Walbrook as Lermontov. He could have easily played the role in a very generic way to make the character a standard villain in the context of the film. But the depth, charm and pathos that Walbrook brings to the character elevates him from being a generic villain to a complex, interesting human being. The issue as to why Lermontov became so adamant about what choices Victoria should make has been analysed by many critics and viewers. Roger Ebert compared Lermontov to Mephistopheles since he is willing to help Victoria all the way to make her a great dancer as long as she gives him complete and unflinching obedience in return. This analogy does make complete sense from a symbolic point of view. But for me Lermontov is a human being who is lonely and has no real connection with any human being. He hides behind his mansions and flamboyant housecoats. His ballet group is his only connection with others and his family. He loves dancing and considers it his religion. He develops an intimate relationship in his heart and mind with these dancers. He became intimate with Victoria too after discovering her talent. But this intimacy is not a romantic one as far as I am concerned. He loves them as his creations. But once he accepts them, he expects these dancers to be singularly dedicated to him and his ballet with no other distractions. This is where Lermontov's comment about dance being a religion becomes a bit of an irony in itself. He calls dancing as his religion but instead he expects the dancers to take him as their god and any semblance of 'disobedience' is blasphemy. Michael Powell's direction is absolutely unflinchingly operatic. He takes Pressburger's script and conveys it in the most dramatic manner. The film's narrative comes to a halt temporarily at a point and the famous ballet sequence starts and what follows is absolutely other-worldly. Powell dissolves the distinction between cinema and ballet. Shearer is absolutely spellbinding. The ballet itself tells you everything you have to know about how the rest of the film will move along. Powell adds some dream-like elements to the ballet sequence which doesn't make it realistic, but they do make it a form of psychedelic storytelling.This is one of the most influential films of all time and I can refer to few films that were heavily influenced by 'The Red Shoes'. 'Black Swan' is a film that owes a whole lot to Powell-Pressburger's style. When it comes to the theme, a heavy resemblance can be seen in 'Whiplash' which also deals with the dilemma of how much sacrifice is someone willing to make in his/her own personal life to pursue perfection in an art-form.My favourite Powell-Pressburger film is still 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp', but even then I consider 'The Red Shoes' to be a masterpiece and a breathtaking exploration of the life struggles of an artist. A must-see for film lovers."
"Even after sixty-five years, THE RED SHOES remains compelling viewing. Based on the Hans Christian Andersen story, it is a study in obsession; the obsession of the Svengali-like Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) for his prima ballerinas, and the parallel obsession of dancer Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) to reach the top of her profession. Both characters are driven to extremes by their desires: Lermontov pushes his dancers beyond endurance, while Victoria ends up committing suicide. Technically speaking, THE RED SHOES is quite brilliant: Jack Cardiff's Technicolor photography consistently juxtaposes picture-postcard locations (in Monte Carlo and post-war London) with deliberately disconcerting shots, where the characters are photographed from disconcerting angles. We have to admire Powell and Pressburger's boldness in including a lengthy dance- sequence that rehearses the film's entire plot, and then photographing it in such a way as to emphasize the sheer strain for everyone involved, both on and off the stage. Some of the sequences are, quite simply, brilliant - for example, the point-of-view sequence where Victoria imagines the world around her moving round and round, faster and faster, as if she were caught on a roundabout and unable to get off. THE RED SHOES deserves repeated viewings, if only to understand just how brilliant the film is."
"""Time rushes by. Love rushes by. Life rushes by. But the red shoes dance on.""I know next to nothing about ballet. My knowledge begins and ends with ballerinas, pointe shoes, tutus, and pirouettes. I've never even been to a performance (though, I would like to go, especially after seeing this). I still can appreciate a good ballet movie, though, and The Red Shoes is indeed one of them. Is there room for any distraction in the drive for perfection in art? Boris Lermontov, impresario of a famous and successful ballet company, feels there is not. He loses one prima ballerina to love, and sees his new young ingénue, Victoria, following down the same path. In Boris's mind, the Hans Christian Anderson tale of The Red Shoes rings true, once the dance begins, it should consume all. It is the only thing that matters. Heart and mind and soul must be in the performance. Vicky initially wants nothing more from her life but to dance, but by the end of the movie, she has to choose between her passion for ballet and her passion for the rest of her life. Alas, some decisions are too difficult to make. One of the coolest parts of The Red Shoes are the ballet performances. Elaborate choreography and costumes are made even more impressive by the excellent special effects (especially for the 1940's!) that augment Victoria's performances as she completely submerges herself in the music and the dance. The imaginative and surreal sequences take us from the passive perspective of the audience to a view from the other side, where the dancer transcends performance and accepts the dance as their reality. The rendition of The Red Shoes ballet that comes about halfway through the movie was my personal highlight of the entire film. It's really awesome.For a movie like this to thoroughly impress someone who doesn't have any particular fondness for dancing or dancing movies, well, that just lets you know how good it must be. On a technical, aesthetic, artist, and entertainment level, The Red Shoes is classic. I definitely look forward to seeing it again. Film lovers, don't hesitate."
