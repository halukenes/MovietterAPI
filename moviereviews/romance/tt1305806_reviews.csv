"""El Secreto de sus Ojos"" hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn't have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog, acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!"
"This is quite frankly an astonishing film. One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact the secondary acting is all first-class. The camera-work is impressive, especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups, and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's, it deserves to walk it."
"Simply put, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies -- but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work, to the directorial decisions, is grade A. The story deals with deep matters, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity, not settling for easy answers or plot points, not cutting corners. The characters are complicated, interesting, believable, flawed, funny, tragic and deeply human.I prefer not to get specific about what happens -- I mostly want to try to get across the quality of this bugger. So I'll say it again: it's one of the best films I've ever seen, as good as anything out there. If there's any justice, a lot of people will see it."
"Last night I went to watch this flick, and I must say that all in all, I ended up quite surprised because of it's impressive quality. Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale's are just true, no matter how incredible they might look."
"This is it. A film that you can't get your eyes off until lights are back on... and then it's still difficult to stand up. A thriller, with lovable main characters, that makes you smile and think. A movie about a crime and a love. It has one of best chase scenes I've ever seen, involving what seems to be real complex camera work, something that could've been part of a Lord of the Rings movie maybe (at least that is what it looked like from my seat). Simply amazing. The acting is perfect. The pace is perfect. The ending couldn't be better (and we have seen so many great films that spoil it all at the end!).Just go see it and enjoy what cinema should always be. It's a 10 out of 10."
"In my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of 'cinema of the highest order'. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what we're going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the country's past, a love story. And technically, if it's the highest order, there won't be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.""El secreto de sus ojos"" tells the story of Benjamín Esposito (Darín) and his need to tell the story of a case that wasn't completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales (Pablo Rago) who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. ""You have to see his eyes; they are in a state of pure love"", Benjamín professes in front of Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); his boss and the woman he loves.There are things we never forget, Campanella knows well, and that might be the film's most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years, as we saw with Darín and Villamil in ""El mismo amor, la misma lluvia""; we expect characters with inner ghosts, things to hide and things to hold on to; we expect total control over the language of the environment (in ""El mismo amor..."" it was a magazine staff, in ""Luna de Avellaneda"" the neighborhood club), a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for day-to-day comedy. In this aspect, the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look, the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year's best performances. That's about everything we can expect. The fact is ""El secreto de sus ojos"" is a very good movie because there are things we don't see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasn't been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture, Campanella flirts with thriller, mystery and real action (handy-cam included); he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters –each of them with a rich, mysterious private and inner world- must be seen fully. It's quite embarrassing in fact, because Darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with ""La señal"". Even though it's obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film, everything that went wrong there can be seen here, improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk, however, and defy you to tell me if, because of image and makeup resemblance, and disposition of images and voice in off, the movie towards the finish line doesn't take direct inspiration from Chris Nolan's ""The Prestige"". It's quoting it somehow, at least.It's very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. We've seen them on screen so much, we know what they do, we admire them and respect them and, as with Campanella, we tend to know what to expect. However, sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame, with every word in every conversation. I'm trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darín do in this film: it's enchanting and contagious, purely human (as it occurred in ""El mismo amor...""), but at the same time moving, simply because they're not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film, or young actors with expressive faces, or newcomers that take our breath away: they are Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this, because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film I've mentioned.The fact that Fernando Castets didn't write the film calls our attention; the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this film-making of the highest order? I believe so, in our country, and speaking of something commercially successful too. It's the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director's previous work and, who knows, maybe other national pieces."
"I am a big movie aficionado and watch a lot of movies. I guess you can say movies are my passion. After watching The Secret in their Eyes, though I confess I had my reservations as the movie was in a foreign language and I felt I won't be able to enjoy much as the real emotions and feelings mostly can't be conveyed in translations. Thus with such thoughts I proceeded to watch the movie. Initially, the plot and the character build up seemed nothing out of the ordinary but then gradually as the movie progressed it held me in rapt attention.Then it was simply impossible to let go, I was entirely swathed in this marvelous and sublime creation. The story line, the direction,the acting, editing, background music etc. simply sublime. This is the kind of movie which mesmerizes you, captivates you and simply won't let go. The human emotions expressed and portrayed are bound to touch the viewer regardless of the region he belongs to. This is the kind of movie which exemplifies that cinema has no boundaries and has an universal appeal. A must see for all movie aficionados and movie well deserving the Oscar.This movie ought to go in Top 250 movies of all times and Hall of fame."
"I agree with SanFava. I am a follower of Campanella's and Darin. I have seen all previous three films. However, this one surpasses them all!. This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks to the excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basically explores what ""passion"" is to the human being. A great passion (on various areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense, a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an ""aura"" (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, ""The Aura"") that illuminates the whole screen. His presence is as powerful in the screen as that of Gene Hackman, Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman (the top, great ones). I sincerely hope this movie gets his due awards (Oscar included), because it deserves so!)."
"One of the most perfect movie i have ever seen.This type of movie come once in a while,and remains with you for a long time.The best thing of the movie is cinematography that makes movie so beautiful.They use camera so well and scenes are shot so beautifully especially soccer match scene.They give a very realistic feel to movie. the scene of the crime is shown very realistic.Great acting by all the actors.all characters are very well portrait by actors.The story of the movie is so emotional and deeply involving and have very well written dialogues. this movie kept me so engaged with all the perfect twists and pace. this movie have everything crime,romance,drama,thriller and have some moments that makes you laugh.Direction of the movie is flawless,this movie is almost perfect in all the departments.I hardly found any mistake in the movie.This movie deserves at least three Oscar nomination this year for screenplay ,cinematography and best movie in foreign language.This movie is a masterpiece and will be remembered among greatest movies ever made(at least by me).I give this movie 10/10"
"I can't add a lot to what has been written. The direction and cinematography aside (which is magnificent), this is an incredible psychological study, involving a group of the most complex of characters. Esposito finds himself in love with two people: the woman who was once his boss and because of inaction, left him heartbroken, and, secondly, a beautiful young rape/murder victim. Over a twenty-five year period, these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time, we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also, in the middle is the messed friend, an alcoholic, who can be a true talent, but is submerged in his problems, spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him, you will see why I choose this character as a reference. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It has it all."
"Wow what a great movie really! It began like a simple crime story but the wonderful use of subjects, symbols and strong references turned it in to a masterpiece. Details about Eva Peron's Argentina and questioning of the terms of law and justice. My interest is increasing for Latin American Cinema when I watch such beautiful works. By the way I watched this movie in It's original language. Subtitles were translated into English. I think by using ""Google Translate"" which sucks. But I had to use it cause there was not any subtitle in my native language yet. Despite all these problems, it was so impressive. You shall see it at once!"
"The retired justice officer Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel based on the Morales Case of twenty-five years ago and has difficulties to find the right beginning. He visits his former chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) in the tribunal to show his draft. In the 70's, Benjamín has an unrequited love for his new-hired chief Irene that belongs to an upper-class. Benjamin is assigned to investigate the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a beautiful woman recently married with Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) that had been brutally raped and murdered. Benjamin and his alcoholic partner Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) feel touched with the grief of Ricardo and go further in their investigation. Benjamin observes that a man named Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is staring Liliana in many pictures and he becomes the prime-suspect. Meanwhile the tension between Ricardo and Irene increases along the days but Ricardo does not understand the signs of her eyes. Twenty five years later, Ricardo is still haunted by his love for Irene and for the unsatisfactory resolution of the Morales Case.""El Secreto de Sus Ojos"" is a film awarded with the Oscar of Best Foreign Language Film of the Year with a dramatic story that perfectly entwines crime, thriller and a subtle romance in an adequate pace. The direction of Juan José Campanella is tight and the screenplay is wonderful, unfolding two lead stories – the brutal murder of a young woman and the repressed love of a subaltern for his chief – with many subplots. The acting is top-notch, with excellent dialogs and many funny lines but never vulgar. The cinematography and the camera work are magnificent and there is one specific scene very impressive with the camera approaching to the stadium in the middle of a soccer game between Huracán and Racing. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Segredo dos Seus Olhos"" (""The Secret of Your Eyes"")"
"When Juan Jose Campanella is not directing episodes of Law and Order, CSI or the like, he periodically returns to Argentina make a movie. In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection."
"OK, frankly, I didn't expect much of this.I'm not familiar with Argentinian cinema, so this was my first acquaintance with director, writer and actors.Boy, what a surprise this movie made. It's beautifully filmed, it has lovely slow parts where director and actors narrate emotions through silence, this feature is almost vanquished from modern cinema where any frame that doesn't contain action is considered boring.I thoroughly enjoyed directing, but acting left me pining for Spanish classes. Impressive portrayal of characters if self-evident, with Soledad Villamil's performance shining out as an example of true actress. Unfortunately, we Spanish-impaired people can only sense the beauty lying within spoken lines and rhythm of the language that subtitles just cannot convey. As for violence and nudity they are used in glimpses, not more than necessary and in meaningful places, I spent good part of the movie fearing that it must eventually get ruined with some trendy shocker effect. But it doesn't, it flows it's own way beautifully to the end.If one can use small court office and a rape case to tell a love story in such subtle and profound manner it leaves me wandering what Argentinian cinema has for us for the future. I'll jump on digging through it's past right away, and I hope anyone wondering if this movie is worth their time can be swayed to yes side by my humble recommendation."
"I am one of the people who always criticized Argentinian movies, because most of the times the scripts makes no sense or the story is slow or some scenes pointless, but El Secreto de sus Ojos is a master piece.The ambiance, the photography, the script, the acting (I cannot stand Guillermo Francella but in this movie he completely shut my mouth, wonderful acting), everything makes this one of the greatest Argentinian movies I ever saw.On a side note, as a reply to dardo766 I have to tell you that it may be childish for you the language in that scene, but actually is very common here all the swearing you are complaining. I think one of the greatest things of the movie is the dialogs, with or without swearing, it is very local and this might be the only flaw of the movie."
"Not often I come to an IMDb review page and think what can I possibly add to all the comments that came before? The movie is staggering in its ability to engage and while engaging to constantly fiddle with the expectations of the viewer. It is the rarest of movies, a slow movie that is never boring and one you never want it to end.I want to ask aloud why Hollywood feels the psychotic compulsion to remake every decent foreign film whether it needs remaking or not? I remember that one of the best horror films I have ever seen was about an undead girl in a climate so cold that the thought of living there was scarier than the story (LET ME IN.) It was a foreign film and the Hollywood remake took place in ... Mexico.Some people will never get it.Highly recommended. But you already knew that."
"Well..I don't write reviews. I often vote for the movies I watch, but usually not jump in to reviews, and I have to mention that I don't understand Spanish, I watched it using subtitles with original language spoken (which I don't like at all, but just watched it anyway because it had some good ratings here) I'm writing this because this one deserves it.Just watched it. From the very beginning I forgot that I can't understand a single word they speaking. The movie glued me into it so that I can't get my eyes out of it. At first, I thought its a same old story a person looking for his wife's murderer 30 years later. Sooner the movie turned in to a masterpiece by attaching romance, humour and mystery/thriller into it.The plot is well executed, casting was excellent, camera angles were directed 100% accurately to express the sadness, humor, fear and romance of different situations of characters. Every single frame constructed towards the final decision of the movie, as in missing a frame would result in a loss of information, and I think that final result beats the endings of Shawshank Redemption, The Usual Suspects which I liked most. Also I think this still underrated at 8.5.If you still didn't watch it due to the language problem or any other concern, please watch it immediately. It's an excellent piece of art!"
"Nothing, nothing in this movie did not surprise me.I expected not much, I tend to be overly critical when it comes to movies (Avatar made me yawn, The Silence of the Lambs wonder) and I'm very critical of foreign movies (meaning non-Hollywood), because they tend to be too dramatic. (Not that I have anything against drama, but most of the times it's just laughable over the top) This movie has great characters, a great story, and great directing. One of the few movies that combined all three in a masterwork. It was one of the few movies who described love and passion without getting clichéd.I don't want to spoiler anything, but I think I can give this movie a recommendation to anyone who cares about the art of cinema."
"To get the big picture before beginning this piece, I did a quick sweep of previous reviews and immediately had to ask myself: why does the same film generate such passionate applause on the one hand, and such punishing comments on the other? I suppose it goes back to the question of ""sus ojos"" (your eyes). Those looking for an American style murder mystery or a boy-meets-girl, loses-girl, finds-girl romance may in fact have their eyes closed to some important possibilities. But those willing to see film as a novel have an experience to look forward to an experience that satisfies and enlightens on every level.""Sus Ojos"" is a multilayered film that, like the work of Dostoevsky, makes us totally vested in the lives of its characters while exploring universal themes that can resonate with all of us. There are two major threads here that are worth close examination: the first is the unrequited passion that the intelligent and humane legal affairs clerk Benjamin Esposito feels for his well-bred supervisor, the beautiful, distant and self possessed Superior Court judge Irene Menendez. Having only completed high school, he has convinced himself he has nothing to offer her. In fact, his life is comparable to the clunky typewriter he has been given, with the defective ""a"" that always pops up as a capital letter: flawed; just not good enough. Esposito is held back by his self-doubt to the extent that, 25 years after the relationship begins, as he tries to start a novel based on an unresolved murder case, the prompt he uses to remove writer's block is ""TEMO""--I fear. Yet he is not a true coward: he simply, like any blocked writer, doesn't know how to reach his goals--both the completion of the novel and true connection with Irene.The second theme, one that is strategically intertwined with the first, is the murder case itself. Soon into the film it becomes apparent that Esposito's inability to resolve the rape and stabbing of a beautiful, 23-year-old school teacher--that is, to bring the murderer to full justice--represents his de facto impotence in bringing his relationship with Irene into reality. And on an immediate level,too, his obsession with the case makes perfect sense. Empathetic and perceptive to begin with--who else would continue to give support to an alcoholic friend, as Esposito does--he wants to bring justice to the dead girl and some element of resolution to her traumatized husband. Soon we are intrigued by the growing relationships between not only Irene and Esposito, but between Benjamin and his friend, who disparages him to barfly friends; Esposito and the husband, who insists that life in prison is the only acceptable punishment for the murderer; Esposito and the murder suspect; the murder suspect and Irene, revealing a toughness and ingenuity we hadn't seen before; and ultimately, the husband and the killer. And it is when Esposito sees that the final resolution is left to the husband that he is free to move on with his life. A simple act brings the decision to life: he suddenly realizes that by putting his ""defective"" letter A into the word ""TEMO"", he will end up with ""teAmo""--I love you: the declaration he must make--the action he must take--in order to go forward and leave the past behind.Visual motifs keep the viewer connected and grounded throughout the film but placed to appear to be a natural artifact of the story telling. The most obvious one is the door image, used in promotional posters for the film. The judge's chamber door consistently is kept open or closed, depending on her relationship with those who enter. Esposito, attempting to put the final piece of a 25-year old puzzle into place, must wait for the husband to leave his house and enter a secret door. In the same way, secrets are hidden or revealed throughout the movie by means of doors large and small, obvious or subtle. A second motif is the train image, showing arrivals and departures, journeys and moving on from situations that cannot be resolved. Esposito, his life threatened by associates of the murderer, must take the train to a new town, leaving behind a regretful, running, Irene. The husband tells about murdering the suspect,the roar of a passing train disguising the sound of gunshots. A third, of course, is the eye, seen open and waiting in Esposito in the beginning shots--this is the eye of a person open to experience. The dead girls' eyes must be physically closed by an attending police officer. Esposito feels deep connection to her husband, citing the love for the lost wife seen in his eyes. A fourth is the interplay of columns at the department of justice--seen top down or bottom up--representing the aloof justice system, corruption and bureaucracy of the Argentian course system that prevents justice from taking place.This film has it all under the accomplished hand of director Jose Campanella. Acting is up there:Ricardo Darin as Esposito, Soledad Villamil as Irene, and Pablo Rago as the friend are equally affecting. Then again there are the strong story lines; thematic development; pitch-perfect cinematography (the chase seen through an enormous soccer stadium is as believable as they come); and even touches of humor, developed through perfectly synchronized dialogue. Is there a happy ending? Well, as both Esposito and Irene tell each other at the end--and as we see in the best loved novels--""it's complicated."""
"As an Argentinian i can affirm it, this is one of the best Argentinian movies ever.Ricardo Darin again makes a big film shot, taking his role on this great thriller movie, that mixes a little bit of fantasy and also true stories, all involved between a complex drama, with real life situations and complications.The story would simply keep you on hold until the last minute, it takes unpredicted twists even in the last half hour.Just a few thriller movies can keep your attention for so long as this movie does, even in Hollywood films is hard to find today a real great thriller that can get your eyes watching the movie all along.Also a great, unexpected, performance of Guillermo Franchella, keeping aside his usual roles as a simply comedian, to take an important play on this thriller-drama story.Truly recommended.Doesn't matter if you knew the Argentinian history of the time (on which the movie is based) or not, you'll truly enjoy it from the beginning to the end."
"Everything about this film reeks of class. From the perfectly underplayed emotions of the main characters to the storyline to the cinematography,it's just beautiful.Rarely are films this well done,and it's just so refreshing to see something made for the senses,that sparks them all so well into life.You'll feel exactly as the director/D.O.P/and producer intended for you to feel.Just watch it,revel in it,adore it and tell all your friends to watch it.Happily the best two hours I've spent in the company of celluloid in as long as I can remember."
"El Secreto de sus Ojos is a great film. If you examine the filmography of the director, Jean Jose Campanella, you can see that all his years directing TV in Hollywood has taught him the craft of classic Hollywood style on a high level. But the movie is authentically Argentinian, both in style and in content. Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil are both deeply familiar actors in Argentina, and the romantic melodrama is quite typical, but the tautness of the suspense and the intelligent plot twists bring out the best in both actors, as well as an amazing supporting cast. And I loved the portrayal of politics. Without giving any more away, the scene in the elevator is one of the most effective portrayals of what fascism really feels like.I'm sure Campanella's Hollywood contacts didn't hurt, and that the movie was done in a pretty standard style (note the tour-de-force long shot in the stadium!), but this is a great movie by any standard."
"This is a wonderful, wonderful movie! Easily the best movie I've seen this year. The German's 'white ribbon' was unwatchable. (one of the worst foreign films Oscar nominees I've seen, over-hyped and so undeserving). French's 'A prophet' is good. But it's like a 'prison break' meets the 'God Father'. I can't say it's too original and some part of it was just not very interesting. But this one is outstanding. It's bitter-sweet and masterfully done. it's one of those movies leave you speechless in silence after the end credits. I highly recommended to everyone who loves movies with a great depth."
"I'm Argentinian, but I generally don't like Argentinian movies. And it's not because there isn't any good actor/actress in the country. The fact is that there are a lot of excellent actors... what happens is that normally the movie scripts just suck.In this case the movie blew me away... the plot, the performances, well... everything. A special thing that I really loved was the beautiful close-ups, the little expressions in the faces of everybody, the wrinkles, the words not said with the mouths, but with the eyes, every desire, every single detail of the number of emotions that everyone has.""El hijo de la novia"", ""Luna de Avellaneda"", ""El secreto de sus ojos""... it's not a coincidence that all these movies have Campanella and Darín working in tandem.This is the way more Argentinian movies should be: actors+SCRIPT."
"It's a thriller. It's a love story. It's a puzzle movie. It's It's an acting tour de force. It's spectacular cinematography.It's a masterpiece.Going in, all I knew is that it was a highly regarded film from Argentina that won an Oscar. I know zip about Argentine cinema, but it's hard to believe a better movie has ever been made there.One thing Americans should know is that this ""foreign film with subtitles"" is in no way, shape or form an ""art movie"" loaded with ambiguity and other hoity toity stuff like that. This movie is the work of a master craftsman director working off a brilliant and intricate thriller script.The narrative unfolds in interspersed scenes involving the same people, but 25 years apart. It's the same actors and characters, but youthful in some scenes and with wrinkles and gray hair in others.The plot turns on the aftermath of a brutal rape and murder of a beautiful young wife. Front and center throughout the movie are Benjamin, the passionate young investigator for whom this particular case is one he cannot set aside, and Irene, his colleague (it was a little unclear to an American what their professional relationship was) who clearly is drawn to his passion and has feelings for him, even though she is engaged to someone else (offscreen).Two shots must be discussed. First, there's THE shot. Anyone who has seen it will know exactly what I mean. It's a one-take (seemingly, but not really — it would be impossible without CGI) tracking shot involving a chase in a packed soccer stadium. The second much-discussed shot is only about a minute long and happens in an elevator, but you will not breathe during that incredibly tense minute.Lots of credit goes to the secondary actors, who portray a law clerk with a drinking problem, the perpetrator of the crime, a hapless intern, a weaselly judge and the devastated husband of the victim.The ending is an elegantly shown series of reveals. The next-to-last sequence totally screws with your mind. I kid you not, it's a shocker and it comes out of nowhere. Then comes the grand finale with Benjamin and Irene in the touching end scene.You will leave the theater simultaneously with a chill down your spine and a lump in your throat."
"The second Argentinian movie to win an Oscar, ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (""The Secret in Their Eyes"" in English) looks at a Buenos Aires detective's passion in solving a case on the verge of the military junta that was responsible for the Disappeared. As I understand it, a difference between this movie and Juan Jose Campanella's previous ones is that this is more mainstream, so to speak. I actually found it pretty comparable to ""My Wife's Boyfriend"", which Campanella also directed. I certainly recommend both films. To be certain, this one has some of the best lines that I've ever heard. Argentina has clearly shown itself to be a fine country in terms of cinema during this past decade."
"This is a response to the commentaries of dardo (sorry about my poor English). What you see in the movie is exactly what it is: You can spot a fan because fans of a football team or hooligans, when their team plays as visitor in another team's stadium, the visitor's fans have a sector assigned ( up, in one of the sides), therefore it was enough to look for the assassin in that sector alone, and not in the whole stadium. The players' commentaries of Racing which appear in the letters, belong to old times football players, of whom Gomez was a fan when he was a teen-ager. It would not be surprising that he was commenting on any alternative of a game with his mother which they could have just watched, and that had been discussed with the rest of the family, for instance, in which case, she knew exactly what he was talking about when he was recalling this or that football player.The mind of a rapist and murderer, is not the one of a normal person. There are thousands of examples of people who ended up confessing crimes to demonstrate their value or bravery. The Simpons are a caricature of real life situations because millonaires, drunks, corrupt politicians or whatever, do exist.And at last, the insulting dialog that you refer between Esposito and Romano, is not exactly what they say. Romano never says the word ""ass"" (it's only suggested) and Espósito never says ""first"" (It's a word game between ""to rub"" and ""to put""). Insulting each other never has a real meaning, but the dialog is more sophisticated than what you tell. Translation problems.In my opinion, the captures, scenes, the love story that undergoes the whole movie, a different plot and more than one very out-standing performance makes this movie a remarkable film. IMO.It's a 10."
"A retired investigator, Benjamin Esposito, from a criminal court in Buenos Aires, decides to write about a case that has haunted him since the days he was assigned to cover the crime. In putting his thoughts in paper, he realizes the case is still unresolved. What's more, he is more involved now, than he was back then. For that he must go back and speak to Irene, the district attorney, under whose office he worked. Irene, he realizes, is the woman he has never forgotten in spite of being apart for so many years.The crime in question involved a beautiful newlywed woman found raped and stabbed to death in her apartment. Benjamin and the other investigator, Pablo Sandoval, try to gather as much information about the circumstances that triggered the murder. Both men are hindered by an elusive killer whose only, and possible identity, is a photograph that the investigators find in an album they get from the husband of the victim, Ricardo Morales. The thing that sparked their suspicion is Isidoro Gomez who appears in a couple of pictures almost adoring the dead woman, who obviously, he couldn't have. Benjamin is a self made man. He came from humble origins, in contrast to Irene Menendez Hastings, a girl from money and privilege. In a class conscious society like Argentina, their possible involvement would have been nil. Yet, one can see how Irene gets under Benjamin's skin. Their attraction is mutual, but it will never happen. She, too, is aware of the way he feels, but ultimately, decorum prevails. After all, Irene is about to marry a society man. The pursuit of Isidoro Gomez doesn't go anywhere. Pablo Sandoval's drinking friends crack the code about Isidoro Gomez's love for a soccer team, the Racing of Avellaneda. The suspect, who proves to be a master in the way he can outrun Benjamin and Pablo, is followed to his favorite place, the soccer stadium. When they finally catch up with the suspect, someone well connected with the government of then president Isabel Peron, bails him out. It was clear they had no chance in ever catching the assassin. Benjamin, in frustration leaves his post after his partner Pablo Sandoval is killed, a death that was meant for him.Years later, Benjamin returns to Buenos Aires and goes back to Irene with the notes he has written. Irene, now married with children, realizes whatever they felt about one another, never having said a word, is now stronger than ever. Benjamin gets lucky when he decides to pay a surprise visit to Ricardo Morales, the widower of the slain woman. When Benjamin finds him at a remote place in the country, he is for an unexpected surprise.Juan Jose Campanella is one of Argentina's best directors. Working with Eduardo Sacheri, and his novel, ""La pregunta de sus ojos"", the director struck gold. The film can be a bit disorienting for people without much knowledge of Argentine history that is at the center of the story. Most of the action takes place in the Buenos Aires of 1974, when the corrupt government of Peron's widow Isabel, was in power. One can relate to the way the story of those years work well with what the creators wanted to present. With the presence of Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil the director had it made. Both are excellent actors who will enhance any film in which they appear. They both shine as Benjamin and Irene. But it is with the supporting players that Mr. Campanella achieve greatness. Guillermo Francella, who plays Pablo Sandoval does an amazing job. As he proved with ""Rudo y Cursi"", Mr. Francella steals the film from the principals any time he is seen. Pablo Rago, is brilliant in the way he approaches his role as the husband of the assassinated wife and whose life ended on the tragic day she was killed.Felix Monti's atmospheric cinematography works well, capturing that bygone era. So does the fine musical score by Fererico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer. This is another triumph for Juan Jose Campanella."
"I had heard such rave reviews of this film from my friends and colleagues that I just had to watch it, and I'm glad that I did. What an exquisite piece of work. I loved the cinematography and the casting was perfect. Darin and Villamil, as well as the supporting actors, delivered outstanding performances--so believable and touching. Took a bit to get into this movie, but once into it, I became immersed. Afterwards, I couldn't get the movie out of my mind. Really stayed with me. What I originally thought of as slow was simply a steady build up to the movie climax. Nicely done. Intriguing. The romantic storyline didn't do anything for me (and I found it implausible) but the detective/suspense part was awesome. Not sure if I want to see the recent re-make because it might ruin this version of the story for me."
"It took me three years to finally watch this movie. It was in Spanish, and it was always easier to watch a silly blockbuster or some series when coming back from work, so I always waited it out. I am glad I did not wait any longer. As other reviewers noticed, it is hard to find flaws in the movie, from the beautiful story, nice camera work and great acting to the painfully emotional feel and the depiction of Argentinian corrupt justice system.The film is slow paced, but building strength with every scene. The characters are complex, the situation is complicated and real. There are no useless plot devices, gratuitous violence or nudity, no ridiculously moral or powerful or lucky or beautiful people. No pointless Spanish cursing and over-dramatic scenes. It's painfully real for its whole length and, even if the ending is pretty intense, you get there in a smooth curve.Bottom line: if this is the film, I really wonder how good the book was. The movie was perfect for me and I can't recommend enough watching it. It deals with love, pain, obsession, helplessness and retribution is a way few films ever succeed or even dare."
"In the last Oscar celebration when we lose the gold little man statue in foreign language categories for this movie -before I see this masterpiece- We all feel sad here in Israel- although we all know Kubati the ""AjAMI"" movie director is a amateur student only, nevertheless we hope -but now i understand why...this movie deserve 3 Oscar nomination and is better than "" Ajami"" Thousand time. One of the perfect and touching movie i see for years. all my applaus for the Argentinian team and movie industry for this remarkable beautiful movie! I see the movie 3 times now -and every time a find something new I discover in this intelligent puzzler,or in the brilliant dialogue between all the characters."
"This is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years. It is intelligent and crafted to perfection. It also stays two steps in front of the audience trying to guess what is going to happen next.By the looks of it, Argentina is producing movies that are at par with the best of the best.One only has to see Las nueve reinas and El secreto de sus ojos to appreciate first rate cinema.One thing that has surprised me is the lack of reviews from mainstream press in the USA. This movie is better than anything Hollywood has put out in the last 5 years. F"
"Was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it. A lot of things happen on the screen, but the emotions are very subtle. In essence, it's another take on the age old question, ""How far would you go for the one you love?"" Here, we have two completely different angles to it. One man who walks away while another can never forget. I did not expect the ending, and while I'm generally not keen on any ""twist"" finales, this is one I'm willing to overlook because it makes sense. We should have known, in fact, that his love was that strong. Absolutely. It's an emotionally honest and subtle drama which centers around the idea that people search for a substitute in order to not fulfill what they are really looking for. The love story between Esposito and Irene who need many years to utter their feelings for each other on the one hand, and the cruel story of cold-blooded murder contrast in a brilliant way, and somehow all of the paths the film shows lead to one point, the disturbing scene where Esposito discovers the victim. The film is more complex and allegorical than one is used from that ""genre type"", and also manages to integrate the ""porteño"" humor perfectly. It's likely my favorite among the Oscar nominees and one of the most pleasant surprises from 2009 aside ""About Elly"" and ""Like You Know It All""."
"It is never easy to write about a movie that you love because the words are never enough to describe the emotions that it gives you. This is one of my favourite movies of the last decade: made with a slow pace and always careful not to let the cruelty of the crime to take over and tell the story. We meet the main characters in Buenos Aires in 1999 when Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) is trying to write a book about a 30 years old cold case occurred while he was a legal counsellor. Benjamin has been haunted by the past and is in desperate need of closure, still in love with his ex-colleague Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil) and hoping to finally let the victim rest in peace. A young couple's dream of happiness is savagely destroyed and what remains of it carries such a deep and honest grief that no one is left untouched. Pablo Rago is brilliant playing the young widower Ricardo Morales, his inconsolable but calm way to grieve introduces us to a man made of love and patience while Ricardo Darin, never over the top, portraits a middle age man lost in a limbo of memories and who has waited for years to see his passions for Irene and for justice to prevail. Passion and melancholy are the elements that have made this movie a masterpiece, and the poetry of a director like Jose Campanella has borrowed nothing from overseas: this is an Argentinian movie with an Argentinian heart and this is why it has to be seen in his original language to be truly appreciated because nothing like the Buenos Aires's accent will rock you through the events. My vote 9.5/10"
"This movie is absolutely perfect. It has an amazing and emotional story, outstanding directing and acting, and impressive cinematography.As a matter of fact, this movie should be mandatory study for most current movie directors and writers, especially those who manage budgets of hundreds of millions of dollars to only produce summer blockbuster garbage. This movie is the perfect example that you just need talent and creativity to make a great movie. If you have not seen this movie yet, please run to the nearest rental and watch it as soon as possible."
"This is it. Cinema at its best. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen until lights came up, and I never saw the final twist coming. A thriller, with likable characters, a sense of humour, and a plot that develops at just the right pace. The acting is wonderful, and the direction and cinematography support the plot perfectly. The camera work is fantastic throughout, and there is one scene with a single sweeping shot from high above a football stadium down to crowd level which is truly amazing. In the end this is a movie about two kinds of love and one kind of passion, but it's far from clichéd. If you get the chance to see this one, don't miss it."
"Perceptible drama with suspense filmed with sensitivity and feeling. The story, set in 1999, is told in flashback way : in June 1974 a Justice Officer , Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin), becomes entangled in the investigation of the crime of an ill-fated wife named Liliana , cruelly raped and killed inside her home in a Buenos Aires neighborhood. Her widowed husband named Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago), is shocked by the crime ; Espósito promises to find the murderous and bring him to justice. Benjamin is helped by his drunk assistant Pablo Sandoval and a newcomer, the upper class Secretary of Court named Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil) who is hired at the Criminal Court . Despite the department already having two other suspects Benjamin seeks tips off . Espósito's rivaling partner Romano pins the killing on two immigrant employees so as to get rid of the case , an issue that infuriates Espósito, hitting Romano in a fury. He finds a track while seeing some photos provided by Morales: he comes across a strange young man identified as Isidoro Gomez(Javier Godino) who watch the victim in a rare manner in various pictures. Espósito investigates the whereabouts of Gómez, and learns that he is residing in Buenos Aires, but fails to chase him. Espósito and Sandoval break into Gómez' household in an illegal entrance and take some letters that lead a clue about his liking to Racing Club . The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, and they set out in pursuit . Meanwhile Benjamin Esposito is writing a novel, using the matter as the source material. Benjamin was personally affected by the case as he tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. This sensitive tale contains intrigue , tension , drama, and an enjoyable love story . It's a brilliant and touching film though sometimes is slow moving and tiring but is developed with intelligence and sensibility. In the picture are treated ethic and moral themes narrated with great sense of fairness and ductility . Marvelous relationship between two main starring , they are frankly wonderful . Very good interpretation from Ricardo Darin as impulsive Justice Federal Agent who embittered by unsatisfactory ending to the case will have to face the traumatic truth and special mention an awesome Soledad Villamil as intelligent and wise chief department . It's impossible to escape to spell of the Argentinian movie star Ricardo Darín. Not only is he continually employed but whichever body chooses Argentina's Oscar submission each year has a huge crush. Darin's the star of their 2001 nominee Son of the Bride and this 2009 winner The Secret in Their Eyes and he's also principle cast in their submission titles that weren't nominated from 2002 (Kamchatka), 2005 (El Aura) and 2007 (Xxy) . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Juan Jose Campanela and deservedly prized with Oscar winner for the best foreigner film . He's a good Argentinian writer and director as Television as ¨Law and Order¨, ¨ Winds of water ¨,as cinema as ¨The Avellaneda's moon ¨, ¨Same love same rain¨, ¨Son of the bride¨ again with his fetish actor Ricardo Darin . Rating : Above average , well worth seeing . This a good-feeling movie full of intrigue , drama , tension , and agreeable message . Essential and indispensable watching ."
"I am not a big fan of rape movies no matter how well made they are. So I was about to walk out of the theater after watching a beautiful girl's body on the floor covered with bruises implying a rape and murder case. I am so happy I did not.The first thing I loved about the movie was the story. Most rape movies show the reality of rape and the aftermath. It is very true that most of the time there is nothing you can do that can come close to revenge. when you leave the movie theater, you can feel how the real world is full of disgusting crimes we can not do anything about. This one was different. this one had a plot that real or not, fixed things. you leave the movie theater smiling knowing that he got what he deserved. You enjoy watching people trying to set things right even after 25 years. you watch them change ""Temo"" to "" Te Amo"". the second beautiful thing about the plot is the suspense. you barely notice the passage of time and the plot changes directions at all the right times.The second thing I loved was acting. I really think they could have casted someone less creepy as her husband. I had a hard time believing that he did not do it himself. :) but apart from that I enjoyed the acting very much. Everyone from the detective to the rapist did a great job. Top notch acting indeed!Last but definitely not least is script. It is not the most beautiful artful script but it is simple, strong, heartfelt and with nice twists like the ""missing A"" and the themes that are consistent through out the whole movie. beautiful look at love, passion and devotion. there is not even one single sentence that is left unexplained. everything comes to a beautiful whole at the end. A very touching work of art."
"I don't typically write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to do so with this one. Note: I speak Spanish fluently so I watched without subtitles. I don't know what could be lost in translation. But being able to fully understand the dialogue surely makes a difference. I've seen this movie many, many, many times in the years since it first released in the USA. I saw it twice in the theater, I've never done that before this movie and since then. It is by far the best movie I've seen. The acting is outstanding. Ricardo Darin always delivers, but this one was just amazing. Even though the storyline moves back and forth in time, it's so that the viewer understands exactly why things happen. You laugh, you cry, you cringe. It's a roller coaster of emotions. The dialogue is amusing and spot on. The closeup of the different characters eyes at peak moments is subtle but so telling. The one camera take of the climatic scene really takes your breath away; you feel like you're there. I recommend this movie all the time. Perfection!"
"Some movies just connect with us more deeply and increase our respect towards films. This is one of such movies. The way story is told and the impact it leaves after we finished watching can't be explained in in words. Even though I watched the whole movie with the help of subtitles(as it is in Spanish) , I never felt any significant difference in movie experience , it's largely due to amazing acting and direction. One of the unforgettable movies I watched ever.Final 30 minutes is just mind blowing."
I haven't seen such a good film in a long long time. The cast was perfect as was the story. Thank's to the HBO Nordic that I got to see this Argentinian gem.
"Only the second Argentinian film to win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, The Secret in Their Eyes is equal parts a slow-burning crime thriller and a forbidden love story that affects everyone involved for over a quarter of a century, following two separate timelines. In 1974, Judiciary employee Benjamín Espósito begins investigating the rape and murder of a young woman named Liliana Coloto. Assisting him in the investigation are his assistant Pablo Sandoval and his superior Irene Menéndez Hastings. Twenty-five years later, Espósito decides to use the case as the basis for his first novel, leading to a reunion with Hastings and the revelations that arise from discovering events that were set in motion twenty-five years prior. Although the majority of the film's runtime is devoted to the 1970s timeline, director Juan José Campanella, who also served as the film's co-writer and editor, finds a masterful balance between the two, crafting a non-linear narrative that provides a satisfying resolution to both threads.Admittedly, the film takes a while to get going, with the initial back- and-forth between the two timelines feeling a bit jarring. However, as the story begins to unfold and we delve deeper into the investigation, the film simply captivates, as Campanella delivers an engrossing crime drama with an ending that left me breathless. I will say, however, that I found it difficult at times to keep up with the film's rapid-fire dialogue. Even though I speak Spanish myself, some of the film's dialogue-heavy scenes demand the full attention of the viewer. While I don't know how this problem might play out for someone watching the film with the English subtitles as they might be simplified, but it is a problem that I found worth noting.The film's engrossing nature rests on the strengths of its performers, which include Ricardo Darín as Espósito, Guillermo Francella as Sandoval, and Soledad Villamil as Hastings. Darín does magnificent work in the lead role, expertly capturing Espósito's growing obsession in regards to the case. Francella, in his after first dramatic film role after an established career as a comedic performer, turns the alcoholic Sandoval into a fascinating character. Sandoval, whose relationship problems and drinking habits often conflict with his occupation, could have easily been a one-note stereotype, but Francella (who bears an uncanny similarity to Steve Carrell) manages to make him a likable character. Sandoval's friendship with Espósito leads to one of the film's most emotionally charged scenes. Villamil also delivers a mesmerizing performance. Much like the film's title implies, the eyes of these characters play an important role, serving as a method of non- verbal communication. And none of the other performers use their eyes to their advantage as much as Villamil does. Through her beautiful gaze, we see the complex relationship she forms with Espósito, whose eyes convey a buried, unspoken love for her.The film also benefits from more than just Campanella's storytelling abilities. This is a marvelously well-composed film, one that takes full advantage of the cinematic medium. Each frame feels tightly constructed, with Campanella sometimes telling two different stories in the same frame or obfuscating characters behind chairs or piles of documents and folders. In regards to the latter, by framing his characters in such a way, Campanella subtly communicates the growing obsession that they feel as the investigation begins to unravel. The film's technical prowess doesn't end there though. The film contains an enthralling five-minute long take set in a soccer stadium that ends with Espósito and Sandoval chasing their primary suspect, one Isidoro Gómez (acted to chilling perfection by Javier Godino), on foot. Campanella isn't just concerned with ideas of obsession, however. The film's conclusion allows for it become a meditation on justice and to what ends someone will go to punish a guilty individual. And Pablo Rago, who plays the deceased's husband, shines in these scenes as he delivers a haunting performance.Campanella's The Secret in Their Eyes is a thoroughly compelling film that benefits from a well-executed screenplay, skillful direction, and a host of strong performances. It's a shame that Hollywood couldn't resist the urge to remake the film years later with Billy Ray's Secret in Their Eyes, which ended up being a decidedly inferior production. Campanella's original, however, stands on its own as a modern classic.Rating: 9/10 (Amazing)"
"I came up to watch this film after its Oscar award as best foreign language film. Although it starts like a crime movie, slowly it becomes into a love story, when we see its development through the eyes of Benjamin Esposito, the former legal counselor, who tries to solve a long ago murder.What I liked about this story is its reliability portrayed from the 70's - when being a critic of the government was considered a reason to be prosecuted by the state- combined with two loved women stories that have lasted for 25 years. One lesson this movie gives us is ""love can last longer than you think"" and another is ""even a forbidden love can even last longer"". And it's precisely those lessons the key for Esposito to solve a crime long ago closed."
"If you want to understand what this movie is about you need to ask yourself why the movie ends the way it does. One may think this is a crime movie, other may think this is a love story. I lived in that Society and I believe it is much more than that. The movie traps you right from the beginning, but the end is so logical that, even if it made me feel sad for the implications, I had no words to express the feeling that the logical conclusion produced on my person. There is a message in what the spectator sees at the end. If you think this movie is a thriller or a love story is because you did not understand it. When you understand the logic behind it then you realize the greatness of this movie. Some people may think it is about past times in Argentina. At least this was what my brother, who had recommended me the movie, told me when I asked him why he had enjoyed the movie. I felt sorry at the end because, it is not about the past, it also embraces the present."
"This is a memorable and good movie, proving strength of Argentinian cinema.While the movie is great on so many levels, some details of the plot are not so believable. However, strong delivery makes this not so important. It is atmospheric peace, that shows you some Argentinian culture and problems. However, it is also a powerful examination of justice in a dysfunctional system, has many memorable moments as a great movie would. So it can be forgiven its imperfections. By any means it is a refreshing and original movie, somewhat subtle which is what is the main advantage of such films over Hollywood industrial product."
"Absolutely stunning! This is a jewel of a film from Spain and Argentina. The plot can be found elsewhere. If it was not a film script, this could perfectly fit in the documentary genre.From most perspectives, the depth and breadth of this film is magnificent. In many respects, a film that encompasses what we're living now as a society. A reflection on our maddening sense of futility when we think, or even dare to think about change. A summary of lessons learned in the sewers of reality, of politics, of democracy. Where ""isms"" are everywhere and nowhere, where people are real and helpless, even when under the umbrella of the Governemnt itself.A must see. One of those films that reminds me -again, that what we do in Hollywood is for boneheads. This film makes me think. It makes me feel. It makes me remember that we, the people, should take action, even when it seems impossible and we're running on empty. I bet there's no one whose sense of justice, stability or political affiliation that has seen this film is not challenged with truths that scream in the depths of the soul. Technically, from the cinematographer point of view, the script nuances, the acting, the story-telling, this film exudes quality. The quality we crave for in modern cinema,"
"El secreto des sus ojos (2009)A quietly building up of suspense and romance , a terrific movie. It has some of the slow pace punctuated by violence of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and it shares the steadfast leading man (Ricardo Darin), willing to plod along until the crime is solved. And it's filmed with a contemporary edgy but warm eye, the camera often moving between things so the subject is half seen, or not seen at all, and yet it is so natural you just get sucked in further.The plot may seem ordinary at a glance, with a pair of investigators, one a very funny alcoholic (Guillermo Francella), going after a man who raped and killed a woman, but it isn't really this main idea that matters at first. In the classic fashion of some great detective movies, it's the characters and how they proceed that matters. We come to know the two men (as well as actress Soledad Villamil, a tangential love interest) and wander through less common edges of Argentina, where this was made.The storytelling is given depth by moving back and forth over a 25 year period, and this laying out of ideas slowly makes you pay attention. It's very smart this way, grabbing the viewer. By the end, the tragedies begin to really move you, the final large twist (or two) to the story is utterly believable and sensational, and the love story becomes as archetypal as ""Dr. Zhivago"" and as beautiful. A lovely, involving, and satisfying film."
"THE movie: Drama, action, love, suspense, an amazing scene at the perfect moment, and more, all balanced and part of one story. And even if this is not the best movie that you watched, it shows that with some (a lot) of creativity you don't need to gather a big budget to make an award winning film. The stadium shot is for the history books.... and again brought into the movie at the perfect time, in synchrony with the ongoing plot.If you enjoy movies like Rambo or American pie (or if you had trouble understanding those), then this might not be your movie. If you want some depth, thoughts, emotions, and a meaningful topic of conversation/discussion after the movie, then this is your movie.Bill San Diego."
"Actually, I don't watch Argentinian movies very often. Some of them are very good (Like Son of the bride), but in the majority are pretty bad. But I read some positive reviewers about this movie (El secreto de sus ojos) and I decided to watch this masterpiece. I watched it in Spanish, because I understand this language pretty good. They talked very fast, but the Argentinian accent sounds like that. I enjoyed all the movie. In the first minutes I wasn't convinced about the story of the movie. But after a while every piece of the story was in the right place and I could follow all the story to the end. It's special, non-Hollywood. It makes you think about what life really is. The actors were very good in their roles, special Darin and Francella. Funny, enjoyable, very deep. An excellent masterpiece!"
"Not usually a fan of Argentine movies, I must confess I found this one outstanding. While I agree with a previous reviewer that Rago's performance is weak, i don't think the ending is ruined by it. As a matter of fact, having been twice to watch it at the cinema i can attest that the ending had a profound impact on almost everyone both times.As to this same reviewer's comment that he finds the references to Racing club in the killers letters not credible, I think quite the opposite, he was very careful in not giving himself away, but the point is made that it was precisely his passion he could not bring under control, that finally got him busted.An last but not least, all the swearing in the language is not to be understood as childish scriptwriting.... most of us argentines truly speak like that in our everyday life."
"It is a long time since writing a review for many reasons and I feel there are many films that deserve a mention that I have neglected. However, having watched this movie, how can I not put down in writing the absolute joy and belief that in 129 minutes this movie demonstrates EVERYTHING that a movie should be. Stellar performances from all concerned and it would be churlish to highlight any single person.... so churlish I will be.....Guillermo Francella gave one of the greatest performances in cinema history, showing everything from comedy to despair. Two weeks later my wife and I are still talking about this movie and it induces so many emotions that I cannot say what is the overriding feeling one is left with. All I can say is that we are still in awe and is now in my top 3 of all time with ""One flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" & ""12 Angry Men"" A must see film for any serious film buff and a rare film that touches all emotions and senses. We are privileged to have seen this."
"An Argentinian movie that won the best foreign language Oscar this year. It had me going for this same reason. It in many ways reminded me of memories of murder.However the movies are entirely different from each other. It is about a sheriff writing a novel about a closed rape and homicide case he was involved in 25 years ago. A case that changed his life in drastic ways.As he recounts the past , new revelations are drawn upon him. He starts viewing the case from a fresh perspective and realizes that there is more to it then what meets the eye. The movie is slow and gradually the plot evolves itself .If you are looking for some nice thrilling moments of action, then this is surely going to disappoint you. It is more of a drama thriller . The pacing is deliberately slow but effective. There is also a touching romantic element in the movie.The performances of all the actors in highly commendable and of top notch quality.. It is indeed flawless film making . The story is concrete and never digresses from the main point.Your patience will be highly rewarded by the excellent and poignant ending. It should definitely count amongst the best endings in movies ever.10\10....."
"Huge spoilers ahead.I love foreign films. I love dramas with strong characters. I love films that make me feel with the protagonists and live their journey as my own. No matter good or bad. After reading the numerous extremely positive reviews here, and seeing the prestigious rewards it received, I decided to give it a try.This movie doesn't have any of these characteristics. Both the characters and the plot are extremely preposterous and even laughable at some places.Imagine how disappointed I am right now, to sit at 1 am and to start writing my first review ever after years of membership at IMDb.The plot of the movie is horrible. Even TV series have more believable ""investigations"". Finding a killer after watching a few pictures in an old family album? Seriously? Hey what's wrong and so suspicious in admiring a beautiful girl you know from your childhood that makes you a murder suspect? Okay lets put this aside. So our murder suspect writes barely understandable coded letters to his mothers, containing the names of his favorite football players. Who does that? And a few drunks in a bar decode them and here the main characters catch the suspect right away at the next football game on a stadium with thousands of people. Just like that - as soon as they arrive there. Then, how do you get a confession from him? Easy. Get your boss, a beautiful woman, to tell him that his penis is small. There you go, he puts off his pants and shows her she's wrong and also confesses the murder. Piece of cake.?!I won't continue with the plot, because I already wasted too much time with this pretentious piece of crap.Hey but who cares if the story is believable if you have strong characters! Right? Characters are what drive a good drama.Well sorry, but this movie does not have such.The characters in the movie are not believable at all, except for the rape victim, but she didn't have the chance to prove the opposite. It is not clear what drove the main character to suddenly be so obsessed with the case. At the beginning he didn't want the rape/murder case. But when he saw her, the beautiful young naked body on the floor, he so suddenly changed, that I thought he knew her. That she's his ex-lover, or even... daughter. But she was none of these. Probably he loved her post mortem after seeing her incredible eyes. It was his specialty, yes? But the worst character in this joke was the victim's ""loving"" husband, who's acting was so misleading that I believed till the end that he was the one that raped and killed her. And no, I couldn't read the love in his eyes. There was no love in his eyes, as there was no suffering too.This movie is one of the most boring, character-less and preposterous crap I've ever seen. And I wouldn't spend the time to write a review if it wasn't so extremely overrated. I can not justify any of the positive reviews and even less the rewards it got.Don't force yourself to like it as I did while watching it. The error is not in you.There're so many good films out there."
"I am speechless. Literally out of words. Pardon my upcoming emotional rollercoaster. No eloquence or compliments would be enough for this masterpiece. The true detective, the storyline, the perfect friendship of non-perfect humans, beautiful scenes, the real face of revenge and the love as it is. 
As a junior lawyer, Irene's skills and her character stole my heart. But even when I get older this movie will remain as my top 5. 
I might be too romantic, but I am left with thought that the movie took its name not from the eyes of Gomez staring at his victim on group photos, but from the way Irene and Benjamin lovingly look at each other.
Oh my, this is the best movie about literally everything I need to see in a movie."
"This is only the second Argentinian movie I've seen, both within the past week (the other was ""Wild Tales""), and so far I'm batting a thousand by picking two immensely satisfying films. I was reading some of the negative reviews and I had to laugh, more than one stated that the ending was completely predictable. Yeah right, like anyone could foresee that Morales would kidnap the guy who murdered his wife and keep him a prisoner for twenty five years. Come on, nobody could see that coming.At least not ahead of time. After the fact, when you start putting two and two together, along with the picture's title, one is able to come to grips with the idea that Morales wouldn't let things go the way the corrupt district Judge Romano (Mariano Argento) did, and would relentlessly pursue his side of the case, in the same manner legal counselor Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) did on his. So much of the story depended on the concept that 'The eyes speak', and in more ways than one. It's what trapped the killer and what gave away the feelings between Esposito and his supervisor Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil), even though that relationship went unrequited for more than two decades.The scene that really floored me was when Irene and Esposito began interrogating Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino). I'm not entirely convinced that what Ms. Hastings did was ethical or not, but the way she demeaned Gomez to make him crack was truly inspired. The man would have to have been deranged to expose himself like that in a law office, so you had a pretty good idea right there that the guy wasn't playing with a full deck. The fact that he was released upon executive order is one of those things that makes one see red in any kind of movie, and inspires that much more contempt of the justice system.All the while of course, one wonders why Esposito could never reveal his true feelings and intentions with Ms. Hastings. He came close a couple of times, and it looked like she was willing to reciprocate, but those frustrating moments dissolved into just another distraction. I was ready to give it up for lost until the very last scene when Irene told Benjamin that 'it would be difficult'. It leaves the viewer a bit conflicted because the woman had a husband and family that she was going to compromise, something that she and Esposito had done for the last twenty five years."
"Not easy to write about a movie that so seamlessly and naturally combines humor, and really good one, with a greater than life romance and crimes, in the backdrop of political turmoil and chaos. The mystery within the mystery is so hypnotic that you can see it several times and not get bored and every detail, every shot and camera angle. A true masterpiece that will resonate to local audiences for many years and yet endure the universality themes of love, envy, sacrifice and friendship. If you haven't see it...go on and do so. One of the best pictures ever....and I'm a Star Wars fan."
I just loved the concept of the movie. Even the acting the acting was to class but the concept behind the movie and portrayal just left me speechless. I do not understand the language and watched it with subtitles only but still I find this one much more worthy than other usual English or Hindi movies as the movie bounds you all the time. It does not let you get bored. The acting was good too it totally complements the storyline and the direction. I can not pick out any loose ends in this movie and would surely remind to everyone who wants to see a movie with a great storyline.PS : These are my personal opinions. You must watch the movie and write yours.
"Do not write this off because it is a foreign language film. The Oscar for best foreign film was well targeted and I cannot imagine a film of this calibre coming out of Hollywood. It is in every respect as near to perfect as it gets. It is stylish, funny,brilliantly acted, savage, arrogant and superbly cast. You get a real feel for the characters, city and underlying corruption that permeates the film and makes you feel uneasy throughout. There is also a real insight into the smarter side of Buenos Aires life with stylish bars, restaurants and a culture of humour not unlike the British. I am told by my Venezuelan fiancée that the Argentinians are renown for their sense of humour in Latin America. The justice system and corruption inside it, hangs menacingly in the air throughout the film but then there is justice and real justice here... The twist will literally knock you over! Contender for the best film ever made and I don't say that lightly."
"Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, The Secret in Their Eyes (also known as El secreto de sus ojos) is an ingeniously crafted mystery thriller from Argentina that grabs the viewers attention from the beginning, keeps their gaze firmly transfixed on the screen with its gripping plot, quality direction & compelling characters, and is one of the finest offerings in world cinema today that deserves a much broader audience.The Secret in Their Eyes tells the story of a retired legal counsellor who is planning to write his first novel and chooses a quarter century old case he worked on as his source material. The plot then interweaves two story lines, first covering the case itself which was about the brutal rape & murder of a young girl while the second follows the buried romance between him & his superior, both of whom worked on the case together and are still haunted by it.Co-written, produced, directed & edited by Juan José Campanella, The Secret in Their Eyes is intelligently crafted from start to finish for it brims with multiple layers which unravel itself steadily as the plot progresses and also manages to throw a few surprising twists along the road. Campanella excels in both writing & direction for the plot is highly engrossing, the arc of the characters inhabiting this story is brilliantly handled, and the tense political ambiance in Argentina during the mid-1970s is finely illustrated.The technical aspects are no slouch and is carried out in an effective manner. The splendid use of camera, clever placements & controlled movements, in addition to the warm colour palette provide its narrative a rich, refined look which also fits the timeline its story is set in. The pacing is consistent throughout its 129 minutes of runtime. VFX is rarely noticeable yet its seamless fusion with the film's thoughtful camera-work & clever editing is responsible for a jaw-dropping sequence that would easily go down as one of the greatest scenes ever filmed.Coming to the performances, The Secret in Their Eyes features a committed cast in Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Guillermo Francella, Pablo Rago & others, and all of them are terrific in their given roles. What further helps their performance is that the characters they're given to play aren't weightless and their arcs are wonderfully fleshed out. Darín delivers the finest performance of them all, his chemistry with both Villamil & Francella is spot-on who provide amazing supporting work in their respective roles of his superior & assistant, while Rago is able to leave his mark as the film nears its conclusion.On an overall scale, The Secret in Their Eyes is a masterwork of sophisticated filmmaking that triumphs in nearly all departments to work as an entertaining & enthralling example of its genre(s) and beautifully portrays the fear, vulnerability & flaws of its scripted characters on the film canvas. Covering the themes of love, loss, vengeance & corruption and further uplifted by its assured direction, impeccable script & honest performances, The Secret in Their Eyes is a remarkable film that effortlessly lives up to its reputation and is absolutely deserving of all the accolades it has garnered. A modern classic, this Argentine masterpiece comes strongly recommended."
"The story is incredibly told with great editing, directing, cinematography and acting. Starting out like a normal crime film, the movie juxtaposes the present with those of the past, and along with Benjamin, the audience recounts the past through his memories. It gets more and more complex, as when a suspect is found, what seems to be the end turns out to be the beginning of a mystery. The film also displays the corruption within the legal system, and the battle between evil and good, with Benjamin being the embodiment of morality. The acting as well is great. The connection and chemistry between both Darin and Villamil, and Darin and Francella is sweet. The film aggravates the audience by showing that both Benjamin and Irene love each other, but nothing is done about it. Similarly, there is a bromance between Benjamin and Sandoval that is touching, but heartbreaking when the relationship is broken. Rago and Godino both do a great job at showcasing their characters emotions and expressions. What really stood out for me is the cinematography and editing. The camera moves with such fluidity across spaces that it often makes me wonder how they did it. For instance, there is a scene in a football stadium and in one continuous shot, the camera goes from a birds eye view to a close up of the characters in the stadium. I am thinking that perhaps they used a drone which is pretty impressive. Similarly, the camera work in chase scenes are just incredible, everything form the shot placement to the composition and movement. Additionally, the editing is on par with the cinematography. There are multiple scenes that do not depict what actually took place but is more of a 'preview' into other possibilities of the story. I found this to be very impactful as it disorients you and makes you think about the story more closely. It could be confusing at times though, so it is both a positive and a negative for me.Overall a phenomenal film that tells an incredible story with great acting, cinematography and editing. Only thing is that it is a bit slow at times, but the ending is just chilling. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
Retired federal agent Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darín) wants to write a novel about an old case of the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto. His old boss Irene is still working in the justice department and isn't really happy with him poking around. The case still has some questions about the main suspect Isidoro Gómez who was released early.This is an Argentine movie. Ricardo Darín is very compelling as the lead. I really like the sense of era and place of the movie. It does take a little while to get started. It uses flashbacks to go back and forth. That structure and the subtitles can suffocate the pace and tension from building up. However it gets going nicely with a very interesting ending.
"Hi, This is my first review on IMDb, so please bear with me. I don't speak or understand Spanish and I don't watch many foreign language films, but I somehow managed to get myself in a mood to watch this and I am so glad I did. This movie as mentioned here, had two underlying themes, one is about the obvious rape and murder mystery, and the other more effective theme is the unspoken love between the main character and his supervisor. As for the story itself, its about the rape and murder of a young woman, and revolves around the police team (a detective, his supervisor and his drunk assistant) who try to solve it, her husband and the killer. It is not so much about trying to find out who the killer is, rather about the emotions involved with the people concerned. The untold love story between the detective and his supervisor captures as much attention as the murder mystery and is beautifully told. I really didn't find any negative points with the whole film, the acting was brilliant, the screenplay was superb, the editing was also neatly done. Obviously I cant ignore that one shot of the football stadium which takes your breath away. I guess I am going to watch more of Spanish and other foreign language films after this one. 9 out of 10."
"The movie is the story of an Argentinian detective who pursues a case of a woman who was raped and murdered twenty five years back and how his life has become inter wined with it and how he redeems his lost case. It is quite an intense film but yet it has its lighter moments and passionate moments as well.The film truly deserves an Oscar. There isn't any thing which is missing in the movie. It has a fateful love story, mystery , redemption and drama inter-wined. The director has done a great job in adapting the novel and has obtained great performances from all his lead characters.Though the story is simple, it will make you feel about the kind of life we live and the choices we make to live with it. It is quite a serious film with a simple criminal plot, no high tech criminal investigation or action but great enough to engage the audience till the climax. The film is a testimony for great screenplay and direction and makes Hollywood movies look trivial before it. Watch it!"
"The Secret in their Eyes is a tale of undeclared love, laced in a complex murder mystery that spans 25 years. The details are so densely packed that I almost would have nodded off had its beauty and skill in the telling not kept me shocked in wakefulness. It is a story of remembering. And how that act of remembering can change the present. What is that timeless quality that we sometimes see in a person's eyes? A look that can hold maybe more than anything, and how it can arrest our thought as they travel a sea of faces; a torrent of years. If they 'express the inexpressible,' is there a reason that stops the lips from forming the words? And if that barrier could be removed?Beating such notable competition as Haneke's White Ribbon for the coveted Foreign Language Film Oscar was no small task. That the Secret in Their Eyes fathoms profound emotions (for want of a better word!) perhaps goes some way to explain its appeal.Benjamín Espósito has been employed by the criminal court all working his life. Now entering retirement, he begins writing a novel. The story will be that of a tragic case he once investigated, the brutal rape and murder of a beautiful woman. The legal system in Argentina is not free of corruption but still a highly developed one. The court secretary, Irene Menéndez Hastings, is Benjamin's immediate superior. He is secretly in love with her, but she is far above his social station and he has no hope of being together with her. As he writes the novel, he goes back over events. Including his unfulfilled relationship with the woman he is still in love with after all this time. A love of justice propels the movie forward but at a pace that accepts some things can take a lifetime. Or a single moment.The murder case is far from simple, even with Benjamin and Irene's pooled determination. Benjamin looks back on his life seeking meaning. Both in his own relationships and lack of them, and in the small successes (but greater failures) that accompanied the investigation. As he replays his memories will he be able to re-write his future? Or are there things to which his eyes will forever remain closed? Juan José Campanella's two hour film can occasionally seem affected. But as anyone who has visited can confess, that is true of life in Buenos Aires today anyway. It is still the bastion of European manners from a bygone age and The Secret in Their Eyes sometimes feels like a period piece (even though the film is set in 1974 to 2000). The subtleties of gentlemanly flirtation, the delicacies of social interaction, they present a careful, often unhurried formality through which we must finesse our way with perseverance and appreciation of good taste. We delicately unpick the knotted past so that it does not reap problems for our futures. Does the real life we have lead reflect our inner life and turmoils? The other way round? Or are they not connected? Memory is a powerful thing and can knit together more than just our imagination, our hopes, dreams, and insights. There are clues we have maybe failed to acknowledge. Through stupidity or 'blindness.' And what are the secrets? How do we see them as they really are; spot the clues before our eyes? One secret it's cracked is box-office success. The Secrets of Their Eyes is already a blockbuster in Argentina and enjoying huge triumphs at international festivals. It will probably be one of those 'timeless classics,' as they say."
"El secreto de sus ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes), director Juan José Campanella's pot-boiling mystery romance, comes to North America loaded with the freight-load of expectation. Earlier this year the picture picked up the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, to some surprise, as it beat out two films everyone assumed were duking it amongst themselves: Michael Haneke's Das Weisse Band and Jaques Audiard's Un prophète, two absolutely astonishingly good films.The bad news is that Campanella's film is not as good as Haneke's and Audiards are, but the good news is that it's a close-run thing. While Haneke and Audiard work at the outer limits of biggish-budget narrative film-making - coldly documenting the roots of fascism in the pettiness and cruelty of village life in 1910's Germany in the case of the former and grittily, violently exploring the tension between Arab and Corsican inmates in a Parisan prison in the latter - Campanella's film is old fashioned. Charmingly so, in fact.Argentinian superstar Ricardo Darín plays federal justice agent Benjamín Espósito. Set partly in 1999 and partly in 1974, the film follows Espósito as he tries to complete a novel about a case that he had undertaken 25 years earlier, with the help of his alcoholic assistant Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and ivy-league educated boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil). As the three investigate the case - the brutal rape and murder of a young woman - they must not only piece together enough evidence to find the killer, but also deal with Argentina's slide into political violence under Isabel Perón, a widow with his own agenda and a budding, impossible romance.It's classic retro mystery film-making, made with an incredible eye for atmospheric detail, made by people talented enough to create suspense and old-fashioned thrills without having to resort to cheap action-movie shootouts. It's occasionally corny and often melodramatic, but it is stacked top to bottom with great performances - comedian Francella as the heroically dissolute Sandoval chief among them - and a script that takes us and the trio from authentic-seeming 1974 Buenos Aires dive bars to a riotous football match, from the paper-jammed offices of a well-meaning judge to the gleaming polished wood of a fascist, scheming operative. It succeeds because of its occasional corniness, because packaged along with everything else that the film does so well it doesn't offend, it just seems pleasant, and old fashioned and warm, an entertaining reminder of how un-glitzy, un-rock and roll mystery film-making used - and still can - be. 8.8/10"
"This film is simply extraordinary, it has the building blocks of the great classical works: passion and sensitivity. What I felt throughout the film was curious and engaging, I was wrapped in an original and unprecedented dimension, as juxtaposed brush strokes cleverly intertwined into different layers, which have different stories each with its particular logic, and which inevitably come together and engage in this powerful and subtle work. Finally one has the sensation of floating in a world that is neither our daily reality nor the story one has seen. Such is the creativity that the insight revealed feels natural and unpretentious. It connects us to a mysterious part of ourselves . Someone described it as poetic thriller is more than that, is a huge breath of life, told from a place touched by creative grace. Campanella: Thanks for your fine work and thanks for connecting us to this joyful palette of dreams, poetry, feelings and mystery ... The whole film has an impeccable acting and technique in the service of a great work. It's a 10 out of 10."
"The over-the-top praise for this film is mystifying. The characters and their motivations range from juvenile to incredible, the pace is tendentious, the writing is banal. The actors do as good a job as they can with a poor script and the cinematography is certainly watchable, though I have no sense of having been to Buenos Aires.It's simply not possible to suspend your disbelief to the point where you can accept the premises or characters in this film. The trouble Esposito and Irene have communicating with each other is something most people overcome by junior high school, even given that class distinctions in Argentina in that period are probably stricter than here. The reaction of the husband, Morales, from beginning to end is close to fantasy, and as for the way Esposito and Sandoval track down the suspected perp -- preposterous.So this won an Academy Award and an 8.3 rating at IMDb? What an example of groupthink."
"Am I going senile? I simply can't believe the reviews, awards and ratings that have been festooned on this movie. The plot: based purely on the fact that somebody looks somewhat shifty in an old photo, a murder suspect is identified. Er, OK you've lost me already. Where would we find this murder suspect? Why not pop along to the football stadium, we're sure to spot him in a crowd of only 20,000 or so. There he is! Quick! Now we have him in custody, let's get a confession out of him, we have 6 minutes. Done deal! Next! The relationships between the protagonists are frankly juvenile. The film is an insult to one's intelligence and if it had been made in USA starring - say - Bruce Willis, it would have been pure B list fodder.It's too long as well, and the music made me want to eat my own fingers. Nice cinematography though."
"I always have a bad predisposition against Argentinian movies, because they tend to be boring and pretentious.However, there are some exceptions, because films like Nueve Reinas, Tiempo de Valientes and El Secreto de sus Ojos are clear proofs that excellent cinema can be made in Argentina.The screenplay from El Secreto de sus Ojos is very well written, since it is simultaneously detailed and fascinating, at the same time it presents complex and very interesting characters.Juan José Campanella's direction is perfect, since he drives the movie at a perfect rhythm and he creates a memorable sequence in a football stadium.That scene is simply magnificent.And, as for the performances, they are also very good.The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few elements near the ending feel a bit forced.However, that is a minor fail.El Secreto de sus Ojos is an excellent movie, and the kind of film Argentina needs to have more frequently.I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm."
"This film is about a man working in the Justice Department trying to find justice in a rape and murder case, even with lots of obstacles and after 25 years has passed.""The Secret in Their Eyes"" has a very well written plot. The story is told engagingly in an interwoven series of flashbacks and the present time, but it is never confusing. There are slow parts, and the constant dialog makes it hard for me to keep up with the subtitles. However, the plot is still told in an engaging manner, that makes viewers connect and sympathise with the characters' tragedy and the injustice behind it. The ending is very powerful, I find myself holding my breath for fear of missing any bit of information due to my breathing sound. It's that intense!"
"Are you in the mood for a well written,directed & acted drama,with a hint of romance & intrigue? You can't do much better than 'El secreto de sus ojos' (released in English speaking countries as 'The Secret In Their Eyes'),a film that was Argentina's entry for the Academy Awards for best film from that country. It tells the story of a retired defense attorney (Benjamin Esposito,played by the fine Argentine actor,Ricardo Darin,of 'XXY',and 'Nine Queens'fame) who is writing his memoirs,in hopes of turning them into a book. When he becomes interested in trying to re-open the case of a brutal rape/murder,he goes to his former employer for leads (Irene Menendez-Hastings,played by Soledad Villamil). What Benjamin discovers is lost feelings he felt for Irene). Cutting back & forth in time,we see stories of the young Benjamin & Irene working for the same government law firm,and the ups & downs of the law profession in 1970's Argentina,during their dirty war,which is never mentioned. This is a smart,well written screenplay (by the film's director,Juan Jose Campanella,mostly known for his work in both Argentinian,as well as American television,and Eduardo Sacheri,from the novel by Sacheri). Besides the above mentioned cast,the film also features Pablo Rago,Javier Godino,Barbara Palladino,Rudy Romano & Juan Jose Ortiz. Juan Jose Campanella wears three hats as director,co-writer & film editor. The film's lush cinematography is by Felix Monti. This is bravura film making for thinking persons who demand more from film than just car chases,explosions,fart jokes & other mindless droppings from Hollywood. Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some strong language,flashes of an unpleasant rape scene,nudity & bloody violence"
"I rarely sit down to write reviews for movies, but in the case of El secreto de sus ojos, I simply had no choice. This had to be written. I won't go into much detail, but needless to say, this film is an unqualified masterpiece. I'm currently sat listening to the music from the credits (the film hasn't even finished yet), and I am struggling to define what I have just experienced.The Secret in their Eyes is a movie of immense power, and that power is yielded in its beauty and its pain. If you have ever loved before, you will be moved... But if you have ever loved someone, but been forced to refrain from expressing that love, you will be moved to tears. This is the thread that runs through a complex and engrossing story of a detective that has obsessed over a single case for decades, and seeks to find closure by turning it into a novel. There are twists and turns along the way, and an ending that will be playing on my mind for days to come.In all, this film gets a solid ten stars, please sit down and watch it."
"It is true that the ""unofficial"" runner-up for best foreign language picture in 2010, that is ""The white ribbon"", is much better known than the winning film, however I think this particular award was on of the fairest in the history of the Academy, and the competitor it surpassed tells in itself a lot about the quality of the movie. It goes without saying that the secret in their eyes features an excellent cast, with my personal favorite being Guillemo Francella as Pablo Sandoval, the alcoholic but dedicated best friend and partner of the superb protagonist Richardo Darin as Benjamín Espósito. Soledad Villamil gives a convincing, moving and at the same time classy performance as Irene Hastings. The most memorable scene is of course the five-minute-long shot of the suspect being chased inside the football stadium. It takes no expert to observe the technical expertise shown here. The political context of the movie is easily comprehensible even for people not familiar with contemporary Argentinian history. After all this is not a historical documentary, nor a cinematographic study on the peronist period, but a touching tale of love, friendship, memory, passion and revenge. A well-deserved 10 out of 10."
"A truly stunning piece of cinema, achieved through the sheer brilliance of so many of the films differing facets. Its nonlinear narrative trajectory and perfect execution of its story/ plot should be watched by all even in an educational sense. Such exemplary structuring should be used as a guideline for all young budding filmmakers. Both Ricardo Darin and Pablo Rago give strong performances as two different men afflicted by the same turn of events whilst the roles of the film's supporting cast, such as Soledad Villemil, Guillermo Francella and Javier Godino, all contribute emotional dexterity to an already layered film. Genuinely gripping viewing from start to finish. Really, i can not recommend this film highly enough or do it it's complete justice in words. Watch immediately!"
"I was curious and intrigued, but mostly skeptical when I first read the brief description of ""The Secret in their Eyes"" in a TV- magazine. It stated: ""a romantic thriller about the unresolved rape and murder case of a beautiful girl 25 years ago"". Huh? How can a thriller, especially one dealing with such painful topics like rape and murder, be romantic? And yet, the description is 100% accurate and truthful. This harsh thriller is simultaneously one of the most emotional stories that I ever witnessed and it's romantic at no less than three different levels! There's the obvious but oppressed romance between lead character Benjamin Esposito and his court superior Irene Hastings, and then there's also the more convoluted but undeniably romantic devotion that widower Ricardo Morales shows for his murdered wife and the perverted (but yet somehow romantic) motive of culprit Isidoro Gómez for committing the inhuman crime. One things for sure, ""The Secret in their Eyes"" is one of the most absorbing, beautiful and unforgettable films of the new millennium. I was wondering how on earth it could be possible that Michael Haneke's masterful ""The White Ribbon"" didn't win the Oscar for best foreign film for 2009, but now it makes perfect sense. Those people at the Academy were more than right to award this film instead! ""The Secret in their Eyes"" deserves every price that it won and it also deserves to be seen by as many people as humanly possible! In 1974, the beautiful and lovable Liliana Coloto is found brutally raped and murdered by someone that she obviously must have known and trusted. The crime is so vile and shocking that it even silences the experienced court room counselor Benjamin Esposito. With the help of his alcoholic but brilliant colleague Sandoval and his new supervisor Irene, whom he's desperately in love with, Esposito identifies the unmistakable culprit and promises Liliana's grieving widower Ricardo that he will spend the rest of his life in jail. But the assumed killer is released shortly after due to internal courtroom corruption and personal vendettas and Esposito narrowly survives an assassination attempt. 25 years later, the retired Esposito travels back to Buenos Aires with the intention of writing a novel about this case that altered his life. He goes to see Irene Hastings, who built out an impressive career over the years, and notices that his old feelings are still as strong and irresistible as before. In all honesty, the more you contemplate about the plot and analyze the events afterwards, the less plausible and realistic ""The Secret in their Eyes"" becomes. And yet, for once this doesn't matter because you are so moved by the story and feel so much sympathy for the main characters that you'll gladly overlook any flaws that only come to the surface later. Apart from the story and the unique mixture of styles and genres, there are two other aspects that make this film a genuine masterpiece, namely the acting performances and the cinematography. Regarding the acting, being a European I don't know any of the actors and actresses in this film, but they surely all made a big impression on me. The camera work by Félix Monti is stupendous, with various great sequences in which he achieved beautiful effects through reflection (in mirrors or windows) and extended pan-images."
