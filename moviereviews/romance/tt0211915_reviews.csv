"To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!Compared to most other films ""Amelie"" (and I will stick to ""Amelie"" since ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing ""Amelie"" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us ""Alien 4"" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful ""Delicatessen"" in 1991.Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry ""Amelie"" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.I could go on forever about ""Amelie"". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, ""Amelie"" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too..."
"Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. Some that come to mind include ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Vertigo."" These movies are so distinct and original that they seem to have created there own spot in the universe, untouchable by anything else. You can add ""le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" to that list.Here is a film so original, so funny, and so warm that it left me with smiling for hours and the people on the sidewalk thinking I was crazy. Yes it is heart warming, but not in the phony Wal-Mart commercial sense; but in the sense of how good you feel when laughing with a dear, dear friend.The film tells the story of French waitress Amélie (Audrey Tautou.) She is in her early twenties, lead a gloomy childhood and is missing something in her life until hearing of the Death of Princess Diana causes her to drop the cap of a bottle which rolls along the floor and dislodges a tile on her bathroom wall. What she finds behind that tile leads her to the decision that she is going to do what she can to make the people around her happier by whatever means possible.Amélie goes about this with great success. One particularly wonderful scene shows Amélie helping a blind man across the street and rapidly describing what's happening around them to give him a picture of the world he doesn't get to see. This is only one in a mountain of selfless deeds she does to make people happy.As she continues enriching the lives around her, Amélie becomes challenged with the fact that if she only helps others anonymously, she may live her life alone and without the happiness she brings others.Amélie's conflict is what rounds out the picture and makes it complete. The movie is deep and takes Amélie's inner struggle seriously, but it's never heavy. Brilliantly hilarious, ""Amélie"" has a wonderfully funny script and is brought to life in visual splendor by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Alien: Resurrection"", of all things) and has at its center Audrey Tatou giving one of the warmest, most sincere and funniest performances you'll see this year.I can't tell you how much I love this movie. Just thinking about it gives me goose bumps and I can't wait to see it again. SEE IT IN THE THEATRE IF YOU CAN! This may be the year's best picture and is not to be missed."
"Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie PoulainFor 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain. But it's popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain', obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn't win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.I consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.Jean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Amélie's mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Amélie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amélie's apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven't noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.The atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie's father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Amélie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180° around her to show her hold Nino's red bag that he lost. When Amélie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.Audrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can't imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It's wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Amélie's mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director's choice, so I don't hold her responsible for that.
Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amélie's pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key's silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn't been used very often in the film, except for showing Amélie's heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old's man face, a close-up of Amélie's hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.
Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.In my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion."
"A slice of heaven right here on earth, ""Amelie"" is a joy to behold, and has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen in a movie. 
Audrey Tatou is perfection as the title character.  A combination of Audrey Hepburn, Dolly Levi and Roger Rabbit, she involves herself in the world surrounding her as a means of really enjoying living. There are moments when she finds complete and total joy just walking down the street. 
Some of it is hilarious, too..like when her pet goldfish habitually tries to commit suicide, or when she is on the telephone with the man at the porno shop, or when a character is asked ""Are you a congenital shmuck""?But for the most part, its a human comedy, about love, of course.
Just beautiful.  10/10."
"A year ago, if someone would have asked me ""What is your favorite movie ?"" , I would not have known what to answer exactly, maybe Fight Club, maybe Vertigo, Indiana Jones even would have come to my mind.Since June, I have but one answer: 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' !!! It is simply unique in his kind.  And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple 'feel-good movie'.  It is so much more than that ! Never before has a movie INFLUENCED my life in such a way.  Audrey's performance is simply stunning... she plays with an innocence, a wit, a smartness and naïvity that even someone with 40 years experience could not have done better. (please, will someone give an oscar to that girl, she makes Kidman & Blanchett look pale :-) The score from Yann Tiersen is so beautiful that by now I'm addicted to it ( I read here somewhere something about 'accordeon jingle', please, get some education ;-). The story itself could easily have been abused, and I'm sure that if Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been ridiculous, but now it is a beauty, a pearl amidst broken hearts.This movie is for everyone who understands passion or who has lost his/her childhood somewhere along the way. If you love art & music, sunshine & poetry than you are qualified for seeing this movie, be warned though...this movie can change your life (and maybe..it will ;-)!
Audrey is superb, Matthieu is better than himself, every actor gives a stunning performance, the scenery is beautiful, the whole movie is amusing, entertaining and charming, even CGI is perfectly done ! 10 out of 10 !!!a 21-year-old Amélie fan who can enjoy the little things in life again"
"'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who's hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie's life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.In short 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie."
"I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.Paris is the backdrop and what a Paris, A Paris of La Boheme and the Merry Widow. Audrey is brilliant in the role of Amelie, projecting a true joie de vivre.The film is full of surprises in both plot and characters. I left the theatre feeling lighter. It is truly one of a kind, eccentric, unusual and uplifting. I will not say more on it as it would spoil the fun.I gave it a 10 out of 10 for something so completely out of the ordinary and so very unhollywood."
"Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to ""normal"" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. ""You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?""Hmm, so would I sometimes. Audrey Tautou's been a more reliable friend than most people and has put a smile on my face and lightened my day at the thought of her more times than one. And I still say I'll marry her one day."
"Waiting for `Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer, I wasn't expecting anything more than an over-hyped flick from our friends in France.  I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.Possible SpoilersIt's hard to put into words how much I loved `Amelie.'  I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet, watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas.  I had this strange but fantastic feeling of being inside the mind of Amelie, seeing everything in the vibrant colors she viewed life with, and wanting to remain there much longer than the two hours allotted.  It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel.
I almost always loathe films with subtitles as I feel that they get in the way of viewing the characters actions and facial expressions.  `Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.  Much of this can be attributed to the delightful Audrey Tatou.  Her expressive eyes and sweet caring nature provided the viewer with fond memories of Audrey Hepburn and prevented me from being distracted by the subtitles.  Could a 23 year old actress with little experience be just as fantastic as Meryl Streep and Katharine Hepburn?  I really wasn't expecting it but Audrey Tatou revitalized my interest in film and left me wondering why her name didn't appear on Academy ballots and what possessed the Academy to favor `No Man's Land.'An already perfect film couldn't get much better but along with the lovingly created cinematography and delight of rising star Tatou came the wonderful story of a true do-gooder.  `Amelie' is a film that begs  you to get happy and should give some short-term contentment to even the most depressed of individuals.  Little moments like the tragically funny early years of Amelie are very special and the best I've seen on the silver screen.  The scene where Amelie is skipping stones in the canal should be studied for years to come as the greatest technical moment in cinema.Movies like this one don't come around very often.  Perhaps the creators of films that pander to dumbed-down audiences who apparently can't tell that their watching last year's film should take the hint.  The movie-going public wants to be inspired and wants to be provided with the same imagination they have when reading a great novel. This is why `Amelie' remains #18 on the list of best films.10/10"
It is the best film i've ever seen.Only the French could make films as good as this. Amélie explores the trivial things in life and it brings you to some realisations of your own in that our lives are so simple and we only need the simplest of things to keep us happy. Amélie is a must for anyone
"This gem is one of the most memorable French movies of the new millennium. Amelie wears its heartwarming charm in best way possible. If you have not seen this movie, go and see it now."
"Rating: ***1/2 out of ****What a fun film! From the moment it begins, ""Amelie"" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. ""Amelie"" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.
Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).
I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical ""Bells Are Ringing"", with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.
Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for ""Amelie"". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.
With films like ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"", ""With a Friend Like Harry"" and box-office hit ""Brotherhood of the Wold"", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with ""Amelie"", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world."
"This movie is stylish beyond belief. But what strikes me most is the way it manages to capture the reality of human emotions, how internal monologues are played out in the form of TV programs, how dreams are simulated by the magical movements of inanimate objects and talking photographs! It is a charismatic portrayal of inner existence and the most natural desire to pursue happiness, both in our life and that of others."
"Not too long ago I was watching ""The Hustler"", and it was quite obvious that the film and practically everything about it was undeniably cool. Especially the way Jackie Gleason walked, the way he was dressed, the way he spoke, he wasn't trying to be cool, he simply was.On a minorly related note, ""Amelie"" is a film that wants to be quirky, it wants to be cutesy, but it fails because it tries too hard: The exaggerated camera movements and sound effects, the ultra-luminous (yet rather nice) cinematography designed to turn Paris into a fantasy world, the odd quips of dialogue on orgasms, but the absolute biggest fault of the film is with the lead character known as Amelie.Amelie is a woman-child who likes to take it upon herself to do selfless good deeds for everyone around her, and the entire storyline revolves around her attempts to fix various problems for everyone within her vicinity. The only problem is that Amelie's selflessness isn't real, she's only doing this to feed her own sense of accomplishment so she can crack that god-awful smile at the camera once that good deed is done. Not long after it becomes extremely apparent that she's a psychopath who breaks into other people's appartments to screw with them (because she, not the police or any authorities, must be the one to deal with bad people), appoints herself as an unneeded tour guide for a blind man and basically does whatever she wants, regardless of whether it actually helps anyone.The film has clearly taken cues from the French New Wave (Amelie even watches ""Jules Et Jim"" at the Cinema) but it has taken those editing and storytelling tricks to the nth degree and spoiled the entire film, even Amelie is taken from Irene Jacob's character in ""Three Colours: Red"" and made even nicer and sweeter until she's just plain obnoxious It's an unbearably naive film that's filled with so much sugary fake charm that it becomes sickening rather quickly, and once the cutesy novelty wears off you realise that there's just no substance to the storyline at all. Some people have been enchanted by the magical qualities of it, but I was completely put off as the whole thing was over-the-top and rather self-indulgent. A film like ""L'Atalante"" finds the poetic beauty in the banality of life and simply displays it in all of its ordinary glory. ""Amelie"" constantly forces you to accept its own childish and faux-magical view of the world, some people can accept it, but I can't."
"I've never ever felt so good after seeing a movie, and I'm not even a romantic. I've seen it four times at the movies, and I'll buy the DVD the second it gets up on the shelves. I wasn't the slightest bit surprised to see that it's a top10 movie here."
"I hate to be one of those negative people, but I hate this movie with an incredible fiery passion. I think it's very possibly the most overrated film of all time. I watched it a while back expecting to see something amazing but I was disappointed beyond words. The main character is very possibly the most annoying movie creation of all time. She's really cutesy and pale and she doesn't say anything. She's like a cross between Shirley Temple and a mime. By the end of the movie you just want to reach into the screen and choke her. Beyond that, as far as I can tell, the movie has no point whatsoever. And just for record, I'm not just saying this because I'm an idiot American who can't appreciate French cinema--I actually love French films (my favs are The Girl On The Bridge, La Haine, and Leon: The Professional). But this one just makes me want to pull my hair out. Anyway, I'll certainly attempt to watch it again at some point and give it another chance, but so far I'm at a complete loss as to why this movie is ranked at #18. Feel free to reply and tell me why I'm wrong."
"Let's be honest: is this film really worthy of being in the Top 250? What with all the psychotic behavior and the annoying, creepy smiles Amélie cracks from time to time while she's trying to be cryptic and heroic, this film is easily one of the worst I've seen. The worst part is when people go on trying to defend it, saying that the character is simply misunderstood and that since the film is french, it offers a different perspective. Do we have to remind people that foreign films also have the ability to suck as much as American films? And I tried to give this movie a chance but the more I tried, the easier it was to find things that I didn't like about it. So go ahead, defend it as much as you like, but it doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most annoying films of the decade."
"This piece of art just shocked me.Not by non-sense visual or sound effects,not by its hard,war scenes,not by its too-profound-to-be-understood psycho-socio-sexual comment ,but by its  h u m a n i t y. Humanity...Just think about that.Have we all forgotten the sense of this word?In a world that depresses us into our little caves,in a period when no-one is safe and sure about the intentions of his/hers neighbour ,thoughts about giving LOVE and HAPPINESS to the people surrounding you,me,everyone are really really precious. I do not want to speak about the plot,this you have already read in other comments around.I only want to say one thing.If you believe that people can love and give,then just go see this movie right now.You deserve it!P.S:The soundtrack is just ""parfait"" as well..."
"And I didn't.The scenery is fine and I actually enjoyed the surrealism, but just couldn't get past the plot and main character.Is this really what we want people doing who have no idea what they want in their own lives ... to go around and jump into other people's lives whether those people want it or not?What we have is an early-20s, female, socially adolescent do-gooder who resorts to match-making, forced coincidence and, yes, even trespassing, illegal entry (and a potential arson charge, to boot) to fill her internal emptiness because she can't find a man.  And when she does find someone, she doesn't know what to do.To some, it's a great movie.  Not to me."
"Two of my friends had told me how much they had enjoyed this movie, so it was a big surprise to find how much I disliked it. The main character, played by Audrey Tatou with the most off- putting mannerisms, was so artificially sweet and coy it made me want to puke. Almost the entire ridiculous story was riddled with self-conscious cuteness. I say 'almost' only because after forcing myself to watch it for almost an hour in the hope of some improvement I couldn't stand it anymore and switched it off.In summary, if you admire sugar-coated dross you'll love this movie; if you don't, then steer well clear of it."
"After finding out there is a new movie in the top 20 list which I haven't seen yet, I decided I have to watch this one (#16...). Having 8.9/10 after ~22000 votes, I thought it must be superior, but was very disappointed: It's a good movie, even great one, but it DOESN'T deserve such high grades.The story-line is not surprising at all, and the story itself is not that interesting...My recommendation: avoid big expectations. It's a nice-little-film. Not more than that..."
"If ever I needed a movie dubbed, this one would be it. Normally, I prefer subtitles, but the visuals in here are so incredible that trying to read the subtitles distracts me from taking in all there is to see.Man, there is a lot to see: brilliant, beautiful colors in scene-after-scene. They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is ""French,"" meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean.However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. As the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps. There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the ""R"" rating, otherwise it would be an easy ""PG."" In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes."
"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is romantic an absolute non-icky way, it shows a humans kindness in whole new lighting and Nino and Amelie share this delicate, tender, gentle love without many words said. Jean-Pierre made this film colorful like only few other people did or could do. Paris looks absolute dreamy and it makes you wish you were born in Paris, in Montmartre, with french as your mother tongue. It makes you wanna do something beautiful with your life, to yourself and to others, of course. It makes you brave, although you think of yourself to be the worst coward ever to live on this planet. Acting is perfect and I still can't get over the fact it didn't win an Oscar for best foreign film. Music goes along with the movie just great, it just right, it sets the perfect mood for the viewer. I really recommend this movie to everyone because I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!!!"
"This was a charming movie with delightful simple characters, but somehow it left me a little cold. It has some interesting devices, like the narrator's slice of life pictures, and Amelie's projects are fun to watch. I also enjoyed the quirky characters that fill the story. But to me there was little emotional depth to the film and I'm afraid I kept waiting for something more involving.On the whole a good way to spend an evening, but alas, unless I missed the point, very light entertainment and not especially memorable."
"**very mild spoilers**
I rented ""Amelie"" reluctantly.  I had the impression that it would be a ""girlie"" film with meandering narrative and boring angst-ridden characters.I am so glad I was wrong!  What I did get was a ""magical realism"" tale of an introverted woman trying to improve the lives of the people around her. Amelie, through clever scheming and gentle intervention, facilitates delightful life experiences for her fellow characters.The film does move at a slower pace, but the plot points are endearing, and it never drags. Every scene has a subtextual significance, where every shot adds a tiny sense of guilty voyeurism as we peek gentle into these people's lives.The plot devices are purposely stretched to fantastical lengths at times. Laurant and Jeunet use this ""magical"" aspect of the realism to cultivate an optimism and effervescence that you won't find in any Hollywood movie today. The mood is always dreamy in this film, yet is never childish.The characters will warm your heart.  Audrey Tatou is perfect as the shy-yet-smouldering Amelie, and Jamel Debbouze is perfect as the impish Lucien.You will love the sub plots of Amelie convincing her father to travel, and how she seeks gentle vengeance on the wicked grocer.  The scheme to introduce herself to Nino, and the plot to do matchmaking at the cafe.  All of these little stories are bound to tweak your heartstrings!In the end: Amelie will leave you with feeling that ""Pay it Forward"" should have left you with... a buoyant and optimistic affection for humanity and life!
I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you are an action fan, an intellectual, or a feel-good Hollywood movie buff.  There are clever plot elements and characterization that are good for all movie fans!

"In 1974, in Enghien in the northern suburbs of Paris, the girl Amélie Poulain was born and raised alone by her cold hearted father and her stressed mother due to a mistake of her father's evaluation of her heart conditions. Her mother dies in a weird accident and when the shy and daydreamer Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) becomes a young woman, she moves to central Paris and works as waitress in the café Deux Moulins in Montmartre. On 30 August 1997, Amélie finds a child treasure hidden behind the wall that belonged to a dweller from the 50's, and she decides to anonymously return it to the owner. He seeks out the man and when she witnesses his happiness, she decides to become the ""godmother of the rejected"", anonymously helping people that are her acquaintances using her fantasy and little tricks. She convinces her father to travel abroad using his garden gnome; she helps her neighbor that is an outcast and lonely painter and the super that misses her unfaithful husband; she also helps her hypochondriac colleague that works in the tobacco shop and the man that stalks the other waitress acting like cupid; she plays pranks to an employer that mistreats his employee with abusive relationship. When Amélie finds the album of photos of an intriguing collector that collects rejected photos in the Photomaton of the Gare de l'Est, she seeks him out and falls in love with him. On 28 September 1997, Amélie Poulain finds love.""Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is certainly one of the sweetest and most original movies of cinema history. The surrealistic screenplay is stunning and it is impossible not falling in love for the character performed by the expressive Audrey Tautou. The direction and the acting are top-notch, supported by awesome camera work and the cinematography, excellent edition and magnificent soundtrack. This is a delightful romance even when you watch it for the second time, My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Fabuloso Destino de Amelie Poulain"" (""The Fabulous Destiny of Amélie Poulain"")"
"...in conversations about this movie who simply doesn't like it. When I say that ""I hate it"", everyone starts to praise the whole movie. Reasons I don't like this movie are:1) All too happy in a too sweet way 2) Soundtrack, which is the most stereotyped soundtrack I have listened to 3) Characters. The main character is simply a nut job 4) The overall look and feeling of it. Those zooms and tracking shots...I've always thought that if Amelie would have been an Hollywood movie, everyone would have said ""It too sappy"", but now when it is in french: ""Aaah...it's so nice."" Yet again, I feel I'm the only one who thinks this way. For some reason this movie just didn't work for me. I'm not a pessimist or anything, but all that chirpy and happy feeling just don't cut it. Having watched other Jeunet's movies, I think that his style just doesn't work for me."
"Are you a romantic? Do you notice the little things around you in life? This movie will show you that there are more people in the world like you and me.I urge you to see this film. Five reasons: the story!!! the special ""filters coloring"" the details the actors the unusual crooks in the road of the filmFall in love with Amelie, I have!"
"A smug-faced Parisian pixie with a tenuous grasp of reality decides she is going to influence other people's lives whether they like it or not. Amelie has got to be one of the most annoying characters in recent cinema. She is mousy, meddlesome, mean, and manipulative - and these characteristics are supposed to make her lovable. The film operates under the concept that quirky equals charming. The narration is supposed to be cute and funny, but is grating instead. The plot rambles on pointlessly. The director repeatedly uses zooms and weird sound effects to convey some sort of whimsical film-making but manages to simply be distracting. It's unbelievable that this won an Oscar."
"This movie is extremely static. It is a character study hitched to a romance. What is seen visually is more often than not an illustration for the voice over narration. It is very close to a book-on-tape. The title character is atrocious. She hasn't enough strength of character to confront a loud-mouth unless it is from the back of a crowd. Don Diego de la Vega could have risen to the challenge without donning his Zorro suit. I don't know when unlawful entry becomes burglary. None of the petty crimes she commits are ennobling or endearing. Amelie is a sad case, which makes the love story rather frightening. The man becomes intrigued when he sees her quasi-pretty face and guesses that they might have something in common. That he gets her in the end turns the whole film into ahorror story. What has become of French film! and"
"I cannot understand why so many users are raving about this film.  Yes, it is original.  Yes, the lead actress is cute and holds your attention. Yes, the other characters are bizarre and sometimes funny. But REALLY !!!! This is one of the highest rated films on imdb?  I have been a movie geek for almost 50 years, and this did NOT even remotely jump out at me as an all-time great film.  It is enjoyable fluff, nothing more.  Did it make me feel good about life?  No. I already was OK when I watched it, and it didn't move me, touch me in any real way. I expected so much more, from all the reviews.  I was disappointed.It is like cotton candy as opposed to homemade chocolate.  French cinema has produced much better than this.  Jules & Jim, Z, 400 Blows, Manon of the Spring, to name a few."
"I had expected this movie to be great, given all that I'd heard about it, but it goes nowhere. Not every movie has to have a plot, but every movie should have a _point_. (Am I supposed to be happy that she winds up with the porn-shop guy? How sweet.) What really ruins it for me, though, are the pointless references to Princess Diana's death that seem to be there only to make fun of people who were upset by it and Diana, for not being ""worthy"" of their grief.One star because I can't give it zero."
"I watched this movie because it was a rainy day and i had nothing else to do, but God this is an awful movie. there was nothing funny, exciting,romantic or moving about it. the only reason why people think this is because of the music(which really worked on my nerves). I had to think some time about why I hate this movie so hard before it became clear to me, but this is my conclusion: The character of Amelie is so freaky,(she's a total freak)that if she would have existed nobody would want to be associated with her. Probably she would have been bullied so much in her youth that she would have psychic problems and probably be in some kind of setting for mental people(sorry if my English isn't correct). And there is no normal person who would fall in love with her,like happens in the movie. if it was a spastic thin ugly guy who never washes himself it should have been a little bit credible, but otherwise this is completely wrong. Happy feeling? I felt miserable, and angry because I had lost so many time on this movie. everything Amelie did ennoyed me, and the reactions of the people ennoyed me even more, they should have reacted like: WTF go away are you sick in the head or what? Conclusion: if she would have died a terrible death with nobody who cared about her at the and of the movie, it would have cheered me up. the only positive thing about this film is that it is spoken in french, nothing more ennoying than French people talking English in Paris. Another thing: why does she look Chineze? the family Poulin is just a bunch of marginal people who have no friends. and the way they react they are just little children who will never be able to get a good job and earn money. and if Amelie wanted to try to step out of this marginality, and start acting normal, then it would be a good movie, now it sucked, because it is much to unrealistic. I can continue this for hours but I don't want to loose more time on this ""thing""(dont want to use the word movie)but I Will stop here."
"Amelie: 6/10: Sweet, light and sometimes a little irritating this strangely adult fable starts out very strong and sinks under the weight of it's too cute for words protagonist and her self made predicament. Amelie is a strange bird indeed. She seems initially one of those wonderfully original creations but as time in the movie marches on it becomes obvious. She is a twelve-year-old girl in a woman's body. Yup she has silly crushes plays silly pranks and a vivid imagination. In fact one could very much see her being played by a twelve year old. This would work perfectly if the movie wasn't so jarringly adult in other ways. (Amelie's quest works in a porn shop, people having hook-up sex in a daytime café) It is more of a tone issue than any objection to adult content. (As a glance at most of my other reviews will testify.) Also like most twelve-year olds Amelie pulls pranks and games a little to long. (After the 2-hour mark or so I was practically screaming at the screen to get on with it) Now don't get me wrong the first hour or so is one of the most delightful screen experiences. I loved the traveling gnome (which started a fad that lives on today) and liked the obsessive tape recording man in café.It also shows a true fantasy version of Paris like You've You Mail's New York. In fact when Amelie is helping others rather than on her own quest the movie seems to move briskly and with purpose. It is only in her pursuit of love that Amelie fails as both a person and a movie. Just like most twelve-year-old girls."
"Amélie grows up a slightly introverted child as a result of her unusual parents.  When she grows up she has her own unusual habits and quirks. When she finds a hidden box of childhood toys in her house she decides to track down the owner and return it to him.  Seeing the happiness that she brings to him she resolves to work in secret to make other people happy.  However can she be happy herself?I wasn't sure what to expect with this film - I'd heard others raving on the boards about it but didn't even know the most basic of plot details about it, I didn't even know who the director was.  When the opening credits rolled and I saw that it was Jeunet as director I immediately realised that this may not be as straightforward as I had thought.  Almost immediately, the different humour comes through in lots of ways - from little things like the way the cameras moves up to the full script.  The plot doesn't totally work and some of the strands are a little unclear, but overall the film really works well as an alternative romance that is as sweet as it is quirky.The influence of Jeunet is the main reason the film works as well as it does.  He tones down his usual darker style and delivers something just as different and unusual but much lighter and refreshing.  As writer he does a great job coming up with imaginative characters and situations.  The other reason it works so well is through the performance of Tautou; she is such a wide eyed innocent - sweet without being sickly and likable without taking away from her quirkiness.  The support cast are all good and features a few Jeunet regulars but really it is Tautou's film and she carries it well thanks to the great work of the director.Overall this is a surprisingly sweet film that took me by surprise and was sweetly charming and lovely without falling into cliché - it was different and quirky in a refreshingly enjoyable way.  If you come to this expecting one of `the greatest films ever made' then you may be a little surprised because the film is quite unassuming and is best enjoyed when you come to it fresh."
"I have loved this film for some years now and I never wrote a comment about this movie, today I have heard all kind of opinions about this film and I have heard what critics have to say about it. This film is loved by many people, but it is easily underestimated, specially by those who want films to give them deep philosophical lessons and impressive point of views of our society. A film doesn't need to be deep to be a masterpiece, if Amelie would try to be more deep than it already is it would ultimately become a worse movie, this movie is not about taking things seriously, this film is about giving people an experience, a pure cinematic experience and it does such a rare thing as having the vast maiority of people who went to see this in the theater leave the theater more happy than when they entered. It is such a powerful experience many couldn't stop smiling for a week walking around in the streets thinking about the film and looking like a fool! I am quite sure this has never happened in the same collective way to any other movie than Amelie......in movie history! That is why this film is unique, that is why this film changes the life of people like the tagline says. It is because it enters straight to the hearth of people and people begin to ask themselves about their own reality and why they can't feel the same way in our universe as in Amelie's universe. A film doesn't need deep messages about humanity to change the way we see life, love, humanity...This is such a simple, universal film everyone can understand. The movie is perfect in every way and it is quite wonderful the way things worked out. Because I am quite sure the director alone couldn't make this movie, how good the direction might be I think there are 2 other factors almost as important, Audrey Tautou and Yann Tiersen. From the beginning Emily Watson was supposed to play Amelie, before she became pregnant. Watson is a great actress but never do I think it would have worked, mainly because Tautou IS Amelie in this movie and Amelie is FRENCH, Watson is not. The angelic Amelie has since become almost a symbol for France and tourists visits the cafe and makes Amelie tours around the city, the prize of the apartments in the neighborhood has sky-rocketed thanks to this movie! Yann Tiersen is also extremely important. Originally Jeunet had someone else working for the movie, but one time he heard one of Yann Tiersen's songs in his car and fast he ran to buy all albums from Yann Tiersen and decided he should make the music for the film. Yann Tiersen had anyway only 15 days to make music for the film and said he didn't have time, Jeunet proposed he could include some of Yann's old songs into the movie and the result was 9 old and 9 new absolutely wonderful, heavenly beautiful tracks all completely perfect for this film. Nostalgic, happy, sad, energetic tracks who together with the cinematography set the right mood for the film.Another great thing about this movie are the colors, always mixing between strong red and green colors which makes you feel you are in a world which only could exist in your dreams, the most beautiful ones you ever had. You could go on about everything which is perfect in this movie, the simple odd characters you so easily feel sympathy for and they are presented in a way only Jeunet could present a character. The odd Jeunet humor we have seen before in Delicatessen and City of the lost children, a humor which only exists in his universe. The simple plot is effective and right not to be more complicated than it needs to be and it has a beautiful message we don't often see in movies: generosity. There is also romance in this movie, but no relationship dramas, dialog, grand romantic scenes ala Titanic. No, this romantic trip is as beautiful and simple as our best memories about love and happiness.Everything in the movie represents the best things about life, love and France. Yes, it is so french and it is so good in being french that you feel like you are french or at least wants to be sometimes when you are watching this film. Everything from Montmarte (a character in its own in the movie), Audrey Tautou to Yann Tiersen is so french, maybe I should add it is a beautiful, positive point of view of french culture without being idealistic (all people have many problems and no one has a perfect life), never becoming uninteresting or boring. I hope only those who have seen the film reads this, because I don't want people to get over-hyped about this movie, it is a simple beautiful movie with the ability to conquer the hearth of people, nothing more than that. That is why I waited long time to write about the film, I knew I couldn't stop myself from making this movie sound like the best film of all time. Because, it was the best film for me, but will it do the same for you? I hope it will, enjoy the movie!"
"After a snappy beginning, Amelie became unbearably boring.  The title character was the principal problem.  About two-thirds of the way through the movie, I lost all interest in what would happen to her. I wanted to scream out, ""Just say something.  Anything.""   The ending was ludicrously delayed.  What did everyone else see in this movie?"
"Being a French film it's more interesting and stylish than the standard Hollywood equivalent - but ultimately this is still just a chick flick. As men, and possibly even women with culture, will know, this is therefore a film to avoid. It is disappointing that the director of the superb, unique French films ""The City of Lost Children"" and ""Delicatessen"" sold out to a genre favoured by the simple-minded masses. 6/10.I must point out that Audrey Tautou is very cute, so if your girlfriend blackmails you into watching Amelie, that small consolation might help you through (don't expect any titillation though, despite the certification)."
"This movie tries WAY too hard to be quirky and cute. The first ten minutes are pleasant enough, but dismay sets in when one realizes that the smirks are going to continue for almost two hours more. Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the reviews this film has received. But - people - there is no content here, only style. And the style gets old very quickly. I'm a great fan of romantic comedies, but Amelie doesn't even fit that genre well. The few plot twists (for example, the traveling gnome) are not set up well, leaving the viewer wondering what is going on, rather than being a participant in a delicious secret. Romantic comedy should involve several intertwining plots, which the viewer is aware of but the characters are not, with the plot 'intersections' generating sparks that can be both anticipated and savored by the audience. 'Sliding Doors', which I happened to see shortly after 'Amelie', was so superior in this respect that I cannot understand the higher regard in which the latter seems to be held. 'Amelie' is strictly linear; there are side-stories, but they involve no surprises and they have absolutely no impact on the main story. (I suppose the resolution of the traveling gnome mystery and the nature of the repeating photo-booth customer could be regarded as minor surprises, but they were revealed in a strictly linear way, and had no impact on the main story line). Rated at 5, and only that high because it's technically well done, and Audrey Tautou is indeed cute."
Like being beaten to death with a really colourful baseball bat.  Just because a movie doesn't make sense doesn't mean it's magical.  Recommended only to pseudo-intellectuals who want to force chuckles at all the amazingly un-funny proceedings.
"What is all the fuzz about??? This movie has no plot, I didn't laugh about one joke because they are simply not funny! And what are the easiest jokes? Yes, jokes about sex. And there are plenty of those here spoiling whatever 'cute' effect Amelie is supposed to have! This is the worst of French filmmaking, not the best! Not even the cinematography in Amelie is original, it's been done before, only more convincing. Conclusion: Avoid this glossy nonsense!!!"
This movie is one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. If it would have been in English it probably wouldn't have even been noticed but now it's a French movie and everyone thinks that it's a blast. IT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE!!!
"This is one movie that shouldn't be in the top 250 of all time. It's merely a rental at best. Actually I'm french, so I saw the french version. And it isn't any better then the dubbed.It's just trying to be something it's not,A good movie. IT's shallow and and it try to dazzle us with the dumb flashy things going on because it doesn't have anything else going for it. But most important aspect for me is entertainment, and this movie doesn't deliver at all. Major snooze.Please do yourself a favour and pass this along and go see a superior film such as dude where is my car."
"This movie is very gentle, and very poor. Just a caricatured vision of a not very interesting character, full of gimmicks and cliches. It's just a commercial for Montmartre. You should see the place now totally invading by buses full of tourists!"
"The first few minutes of the film leave you wondering where on earth it's going, but be patient, it's all worth it. Amelie is a real feel-good film, though not in the stereotypical Hollywood style. Its full of mystery, humour, and moments that make you think 'I wish I'd thought of that!' - for example, the way she sends Nico on a wild-goose-chase in the park at the Montmartre carousel. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie, a simple girl on the surface but with astonishing inventiveness, bewildering all around her.As a director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has a unique style. He seems to make great use of colour - some would say to unnecessary extremes, but for me it gives the film a sunshiny feel, whatever the weather in the film. He also likes to zoom about with his camera's, but again this all adds to the way the film completely draws you into its own world, just as Amelie draws Nico into her world without them actually really meeting. A few nice special effects top it off, and there are a few little details that you probably won't see the first couple of times you watch it.I'm no film expert, but I loved this film, its my favourite of all time (so far, anyway), and I'm in danger of wearing out my DVD. There are some people who don't see what all the fuss is about: for them it's too sickly-sweet, or they see Amelie as a meddler or nosy-parker, but I think they've just somehow missed the essence of the film, poor things ;) Don't read too many detailed reviews before watching it, or you could spoil the surprises. Just get the video and watch it. And then watch it again. And again."
"This movie I watched for a few minutes and well, the unexpected plot, cartoon type characters, I was sort of caught off guard. From the start I found the Amelie character, in some ways criminal. Even her devious look on the cover shot I wonder, maybe she would have worked in a Bugs Bunny cartoon as the girlfriend of Wile E. Coyote. Not to be malicious just this movie was so odd. It seems so many people like this movie and for the life of me I cannot understand why. People I've read who like the movie there is a strange correlation to hash usage. To me this makes me wonder if I should stat smoking hash. Well the state I live in has very strict laws and guess that is not a viable option."
"Amazing movie telling how you should take a chance and get what you want instead of sitting back and letting everything slip away! If the story does not move you in some way, even the most miniscule amount, I do not know what can. Audrey Tatou is great as the shy girl out to make her small world in Montmartre a better place by finding little ways to make someone's day, but forgetting to look after her own happiness in the process. Mathieu Kassovitz is adorable as Nino the eccentric collector. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is excellent at what he does and I cannot wait to see his new partnership with Audrey Tatou in ""The Long Engagement""!"
"this must be one of THE BEST movies I have seen in the past couple of years. It managed to demonstrate the technical side of today's high-tech movie making (excellent job on digital sound and CG effects), while preserving the artistic qualities. Amazing cinematography, plot and acting. This movie made me laugh my ass off. A comedy and romance all in one. I saw it twice in 2 days and will see it again.Wish all movies were less Holleywood-hype and more quality, like this one. I am not all artsy and anti-holleywood, but I am getting a bit tired of the cliche movies coming out of USA."
"Spoilers herein.I avoided this film for ever-so-long because of what I had heard about it. One would believe that this is a well-photographed simple sweet story. That somehow it has something to do with the adventures of a sweet girl-woman. Well, it is. But it is so much else, and that `something else' not only makes the sickly sweetness tolerable -- it completely undermines it. That's because every film rests on three threads that connect between it and us the viewers. The first thread is the story, which many people -- even filmmakers -- would have you believe is either all there is or at least that it is paramount. The second thread -- more visceral and immediate -- is the cinematic presentation. This filmmaker has wisely chosen to make the visual space coincide with the fondly imagined nostalgia of a simple past. All is simple, clean, abstract, sweet. Even Paris, whose primary products are dog poop and meanspirited grafitti.But that third thread is the most important -- even more powerful, perhaps because of its subliminal nature. And it is here that this film is rooted, and the rooting is superb, intelligent.That root is George Perec, probably France's most influential writer. Not the most known or best loved, he directly approached a problem of the French character: that they were once an important people artistically. How does one be creative in a land populated by dead, giant saints? You build metastructures of the structures already there -- you build stories about stories. The component stories can be as trite as the public demands, but the assembly -- the structure of which eludes the casual viewer -- can be as clever as you wish.In 1978, Perec published a large book called `Life, a User's Manual.' It is a wonderful work which every literately educated person should encounter. It answers the question `what can a writer do after Robbes-Grille?' (which is roughly the same question as what can a French filmmaker do after the `new wave?') This film is very closely based on that book in both form and content.The book is a collection of several hundred stories, many of the type `at this precise moment, Jacques was removing sand from his toenails (the location of the beach perhaps being a setting for the previous story) and recalling the sand on the photographs he took of his honeymoon in Chartres where Jeanette first saw his feet and said she fell in love with them alone...' All these stories are triggered or anchored in some physical detail, like a box left by a child in the wall, or a torn photograph on the floor of a train station., or a lamp in the form a character.  Most of these stories involve unnecessary losses, small decisions of great consequence or attempts to represent and/or assemble the other stories in a personal context.The book's central organizing device was an apartment building in the same location in Paris as the film. There are so many characters and stories that the book provides diagrams.Elements from the book in the movie (as I recall): images that are torn and reassembled, a painter painting the same scene over and over, a found child's treasurebox, a simpleminded son, a `glass man,' images from all over the world, a funhouse, a fine meal disguised. Minor mysteries solved (the image is of a repairman), characters who are recorders (the jealous boyfriend with his tape, the painter with his VCR, the maintainer of the photobooths, the stewardess who photographs the gnome) characters who create reality (the girl who imagines both reality and films on the TeeVee, the man who is the `designated mourner' for reconstructed images, the painter who is reinventing Amelie).The wind caused two glasses to dance; the important thing here is the wind, not the glasses. If you have not seen this, please do. But see the story as deliberately facile and trite, intended to only be pieces that should be assembled by you to make a real picture. Anyone who thinks this is a just a sweet story should have their license to view films revoked.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
"I cannot begin to understand why this movie is in the top 250 on IMDb. I tried to like this film but now that I have wathced it twice (!) I honestly have to say that this is one of the WORST films I have ever seen. Most of you will probably like it because it has a ""deeper meaning"" and that it's deeply philosophical. I have to disagree. To me, this is just one movie about a weird chick looking for something she cannot define. This results in a movie which is boring as hell and left me with an empty feeling. As I said, I have watched it once, thought it was crappy, read some reviews and went back to it again. And my opinion did not change at all. Most of you will strongly disagree, but what the heck. That's why opinions exist, right? Anyone with me on this or am I the only person who hates this movie?? Thanks for reading!"
"Everyone was telling me how great this movie is, and it was already running for months in local theaters... As Jeunet did 2 great movies with Caro (La Cité des Enfants Perdus and Delicatessen), I was expecting a lot. Granted, the movie starts out cute. But once Amelie sees her destination, everything turns out to the worst. Her acting is as if she's a Jesus freak on heroine. At that moment I had to switch off the DVD and was happy I only borrowed the DVD from my brother. Hard to say which is my favourite movie, but this is definitely my all-time non-favourite movie. Too bad I am not allowed to give 0 stars."
"Amelie is the quirky main character, who seems to go on a binge of ""random acts of kindness"" except that they aren't so random, and some are kind of mean. It is reasonably enjoyable, and probably worth a rental. I cannot fathom its ranking, though. I think that films should maybe be a few years old before being eligible for the top films of all times lists, like the top 250. I looked through that list and there are some new films which will be utterly forgotten in 20 years. I fear that ""Amelie"" will be among them. Grade: C"
"Why do people like this film?  8/10 ?!!  If you didn't know, it's about a ``quirky`` French woman who goes around doing good deeds.  Baffling how this film became so popular, before I saw it I actually expected to enjoy it. :- /Honestly, there is nothing good you can say about it, and you can't argue that the humour doesn't translate across - I can speak French fluently. The music is as annoying as the acting and the story.OK, enough; don't waste your money or time with this rubbish."
"Amélie is by far my most favorite film. I almost cannot describe how magically wonderful this film is. From the story, the characters, the hair styles, the fashion, the special effects, and especially the actors. There is not one single thing that I dislike about Amélie.This is one of the most original and ingenious love stories ever written. The world of Amélie's mind is truly a wondrous place to reside.Major kudos to director Jean-Pierre Jeunet for one of the most creative efforts ever put forth on film. Every character was cast perfectly. I am so pleased that Audrey Tautou was selected over Jeunet's original choice of Emily Watson.If you like any type of romance story, or foreign films, this is the story for you.The DVD is packed with tons of extras that make the story go on and on. I highly recommend this film to be added to anyone's film collection. J'aime Amélie."
"This movie brought tears to my eyes, bringing back long-lost childhood memories of that day when I was sharply kicked in the groin.Who can't see the sweet charm of the adorable, mischievous, pouting Amelie? Who can't shed a tear for the lost love, the lost dreams within all of us, that Je-ne-sais-quoi that we all long for can never seem to attain?Amelie is pure magic, not magic like Magic Markers(tm), or Magic Johnson, but real magic, like only the French can deliver. No, not ""magique"", but Magie, as I've been told by the great google translator. Those who can't see the tear-drenched beauty and pathos of this great film, the tears of thousands of us living a Lie in this angst-ridden loveless world, need to consider some serious self-examination, spiritual rebirth, or at least a different diet, perhaps with fewer carhohydrates and more fatty acids."
"It is very possible that I don't have the intellect or the ability to appreciate cinematic masterpieces.  However, free speech enables me to voice my less than enthuasitic endorsement of Jeunet's ""Amelie"".Jenuet's ""Amelie"" is one of those feel-good movies that makes people dream into believing anything is possible.  Its very ""nice"" and a commendable deed indeed; however, Jenuet fails to deliver ... I would have much appreciated subtelty in depicting the everyday Parisians ... not an aggressive, preachy, in your face romanticism that seems to lack genuine warmth. 
I was not a huge fan of Jeunet's style - his love for hurried camerawork, frequent character zoomins and other visual imagery (the key in her pocket when she makes a duplicate) was distracting and served to just underline the lack of genuine warmth.The saving grace of the movie is the obviously talented Audrey Tautou who plays the role of the outsider to the T.  Her understanding of the role prevents the movie from becoming another fuzzy role of a girl we root for as she changes the world.  I am not a cynic - but I did get bored with the method employed by Jeunet. After a while, the movie just kept on dragging.  Tautou does a good job; and, I did like the colours used in each frame which gave the movie more life than it really had."
"First things first, with its incessant and unfunny narrration this is a boring film. smug is not the word to describe the nature of the film and its main character.  the attempt at humour is so forced, and ""clever"" only someone without a sense of humour or fun could find any thing funny in this plodding and often insulting film.  i think most of the critics and then sections of the public that follow critics have had a taste bypass, i would love to see how people react to this film in ten years time, with embarrasment that they like it in the first place."
"If this film were a person it would go around telling people how clever it was.... often indicating that it was not.The film is a complete waste of 2 hours, filled with bizarre moments and a central character that is nothing but annoying.A few intriguing characters appear (for example the boy who works at the grocer), but they are quickly lost in this film, which attempts to stun the audience with its surreal moments and imagery.This film clearly displays everything that is wrong with French cinema today.Avoid at all costs."
"This movie is at number 14 in the top 250. It was nominated in several categories for the oscars by March 2002. All around the world, Amélie Poulain elated millions of people. The question I ask myself is this one: why did this film make millions of people so happy? I saw it last year at the cinema; it's not that I didn't like it, it left me indifferent and I watched it very carelessly. A naive girl whose name is Amélie Poulain discovers what her destiny is: make people happy. She'll succeed in before she falls in love with a man (Mathieu Kassovitz). I think it's a lacklustre and dull film. The screenplay isn't very entertaining and it looks as if there is no plot. The main thema of the movie, which is for Amélie to make people happy, is more sketched out than really explored. Moreover, the dialogues are vain and most of the characters are talking for nothing. Above all, several sides of the film didn't please me, especially its humor. The movie wants to be funny but according to me, the humor usually falls flat and sometimes it can fade into the heaviness like the love scene in the cafe. There is something that I don't like in the Amélie Poulain's character; I think she is dope, a bit dumb and she's got very odd thoughts ( how many couples will have an orgasm in the next second!!!). Besides, the actors aren't very great. I mean that they aren't very well defined. We learn what they like or don't like but for most of them, their tastes or hates are only tics (like Jamel Debbouze who cherishes fruits and vegetables because he's a greengrocer). On the other hand, some elements of the film are useless and barely bring interest to the movie, I think about Amélie's father who loves his garden gnome, or the old man who tries hard to reproduce Renoir's painting ""le déjeuner des canotiers"". To sum up: Amélie's destiny's got nothing fabulous and it's a film that lacks of poetry and is a speading of clever visuals and ringing brainwaves."
"This movie tries so hard to be cute and clever that its concentrated sweetness gave me a high for about five minutes and then I crashed for the rest of it. Amalie (Audrey Tautou) has the demeanor of a spoiled little girl who grew up thinking she was ever so cute. She seems to be saying, ""Look at me, can you resist me?"" And then she gives off a self-satisfied smile with the hint, ""You thought I was cute before, aren't you blown away by my smile?"" Ugh.But the thing that really bugs me about this movie is Amelie's conceit. She presumes to know what will make others happy and meddles in their lives. Among the things this adorable girl does is break and enter an apartment to do mean things to its owner's possessions, send false letters, short out people's TV's at peak moments, lie to people about who loves them, make anonymous phone calls without having the integrity to speak with the callee, and steal one of her father's prize possessions.I know that we are supposed to accept the fantasy nature of this film where photos talk, statues wink, and people always answer public phones, but my patience for this kind of thing wore thin very fast. We are told, shown actually, that Amelie's mother was killed by a suicidal person jumping off of Notre Dame and landing on her. How are are we supposed to react to that? Is it supposed to be funny? Wasn't to me.Then there is the agonizing game that Amelie plays with the guy she falls for. She gives him hints and, given the opportunity to make contact, shies away. You just want to shake her and tell her to just talk to the guy for heaven's sake. Finally at the end they meet and the first thing they do without saying a word is kiss and have sex. What kind of message is that? The whole movie is filmed through some kind of orange filter that I suppose is meant to cast some sort of romantic candle-lit effect over the proceedings, but for me it was just one more barrier that prevented me from getting close to this movie."
"this might be another case where the massive hype surrounding the movie raised my expectations so much that the end product, even though it was entertaining, funny and touching was hardly as good as i expected it to be.
audrey tatou has done a wonderful job playing the role of the shy and introverted amelie, her magical discovery and how it changes her life are smartly portrayed. the movie's narration and style are delightful and the movie constantly entertains with its funny touches. having said that a lot of the scenes are very predictable and cliched, particularly the episode with the grocer. funny yes, but cliched.the movie honestly is wonderful and cute, but thats about all. i fail to see how this is one of the greatest movies of all time. top 10 most definitely not. another case where, on a rare occassion, the american audience has been exposed to a non-hollywood style movie they go totally gaga. last year's crouching tiger being another case in point. sad but true.amelie though is a nice movie, but nothing great for people exposed to other wonderful movies from around the world.a cute but disappointing 7!"
"There are no complaints when watching ""Amelie."" It is pleasant enough, and it even displays a bit of depth that is the hallmark of better romantic and ""feel good"" comedies. However--- it isn't a great movie. It is no masterpiece. The foppish poseurs who drool over this light fare as if there were beholding some amazing jewel is getting a bit annoying. In the artsy theater in our town, I could hear the forced and hollow ""salon chuckles"" of the local cognoscente wannabes, as if displaying to us all that they, too, ""get it."" Humbug! Those folks should get out more!This is a good movie, and it deserves to be watched and enjoyed. But dang, folks... while this emperor's new clothes may not be totally imaginary, he is, nonetheless, given all the uber-hype and Oscar predictions for this cinematic bauble, severely underdressed."
"First I'm German so pardon my English, if I got mistakes in spelling.I'm a real film fan. I own more than 100 DVD's. Among them are most of the top 250s of the IMDb list. This one just got my attention because of the high votes and interesting summary. But i never managed to watch it completely because this movie is one of the most boring, annoying, meaningless piece of bullshit I ever saw. Is it meant to be some kind of an art film? Then go and watch ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a dream"" instead. The cinematography tries hard to be original, but it's no compare to a David Fincher movie (Fight Club rules!!!). The narration is annoying as hell in this movie, it's too fast and has no substance. The actor are everything else than believable. Mr. Jeunet just made ""Alien 4"" into the weakest of all alien movies (yes even weaker than ""alien 3"" and AVP), and he just went back to his homeland. Never set foot on Hollywood again!"
"... I don't really know what the other ingredient of the mixture is, but it is annoying. I must say, ""Amelie"" was one of the most unexpected disappointments in my life as a cinemaphile.I love French cinema in general (as opposed to Hollywood films - even the most acclaimed ones have at least one corny moment that makes me cringe). And the basic premise of this film was so much to my taste that I couldn't wait to see it. And sure enough: the photography and the overall cinematic ""style"" are gorgeous; so is the sense of humour of the first 30 minutes or so.But then, halfway through the film, ""Amelie"" simply lost me. I am not sure why. Maybe it was the overexerted ""fairy tale"" style which put me off it. (And that could be because the implicit message of ""fairy tales"" is that they are just that: fairy tales.)Perhaps the people who rave about it are starved for fairy tales in their lives. (No offence intended - please!) If this film made someone look at their life in a different light - good for them! I am glad. To me, it looked too far removed from the magic of true life to really make an impact - or even keep me in front of the screen. I feel ""Amelie"" is a missed opportunity for something that could have been truly, amazingly great."
"Unlike Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Cité de enfants perdu which never has a period, or moment of greatness, Amélie manages to be great and wonderfully inventive for about the first half hour until Bretodeau gets his box back. After that it's as if we've watched the origin story of a super hero and then watch her go about her daily routine (changing from Clark Kent to Superman, so to speak). The film then hits a structural snag, whereas, now Amelie has satisfied the desire of one man she goes off and tries to help everyone almost at once and we are told of these incidents simultaneously. The film had its greatest grip on me when we were focused on one story, there would've been nothing wrong with vignettes after all it was good enough for Truffaut in Small Change. 	Amelie begins wonderfully, with voice-over narration of her early life which the French seem to be masters at, the best example of voice-over being in Leolo a Quebecois film. Her childhood full of its strange events come across as hilarious whereas other cultures might have botched them making them distasteful, the death of her mother being a perfect example. The quirky humor is about the only thing that never leaves the film from the ticket taker who now punches holes in plants, the stuffed dog, the traveling gnome etc. When Bredoteau finds his box we flashback to what memories those items held for him in what are truly beautiful moments of the film. This is my moment of highest involvement, that sequence was a pinnacle which the narrative never achieved again. 	Part of the problem is the predictability the film later runs into. I'm terrible at guessing the ends of movie but once we were introduced to Nino and told of his past I knew that he and Amelie would end up together. So obviously, it was nerve-wracking and annoying that she was so painfully shy and prolonged the movie unnecessarily. Then there's the almost American complication in the relationship between Georgette and the bar drunk by her talking to Nino were so uncalled for. Then we also have the ""Glass Man"" and Amelie pondering Renoir's painting. While in the beginning it's commenting on Amelie is subtle it becomes more and more overt as the film moves on. The there are Jeunet's shots of Amelie smiling to extract her cuteness for some affect and frankly she's not all that cute and the shots are inorganic which is even worse. The special effects also eventually become pedantic when the key in her pocket shines, it makes me wonder what kind of film this would've turned into if Jeunet had been given a Lucas-like amount of special effect allowances in the budget. 	The cinematography in this film is quite spectacular but in certain instances the effects downplay what they have been able to do with the camera. The change in structure of this film ultimately creates a domino effect. While I can't re-write the film I wonder if I would be nit-picking so much if there hadn't been such a shift in the way the story was told. In the end Amelie is an enjoyable experience that may just have indulged its premise a bit too much-6/10."
"Amélie caused a stir when it was released and you should have a look to see why. The eccentric characters are as delightful as the zappy quirky tone. From the storyline, to the cinematography to the soundtrack, it's stylistically interesting. Was blown away.Essentially, it's a meditation on life. A young woman sets out to fix the problems of others as a way of ignoring the fact that she herself is damaged. One of the most memorable aspects is the wondrous central performance of Audrey Tautou.The most remarkable fantasy of this movie is the Paris that Jean-Pierre Jeunet conjures up. It is supposed to be modern Paris, at the time of Princess Diana's death, but could be the Paris of 50 years before. The twisted realism makes Wes Anderson films seem quite ordinary.Conclusion: Impossible to resist, heartily recommend."
"This film is such a magical portrayal of imagination, emotion, and humanity.It is truly so beautiful, funny, and touching, and even if you typically don't enjoy foreign films, reading these subtitles is totally worth it!"
"Every single moment of this movie is calculated to be lovable. With a wink. I hate these movies that attack you with whimsy, and this is one of the most violent I've seen. Not only is it achingly cute but it's also ""naughty"" with wild offscreen sex and endearing porn shop employees. I don't understand why in these romantic comedies I'm supposed to care about whether two people who don't even know each other get together or not. I'd rather see Amelie as a movie where this couple gets together and then he gets to find out what a nutjob she is. Can you imagine living with this woman and her wacky schemes? There are a lot of clever little details, like the identity of the photo booth guy and the traveling gnome, but these don't take away the pain, they just dull it. ** out of ****"
"What are you thinking? How can this be one of the best movies of all time? Maybe in on the list, but in the top ten movies? This was a pretty good movie in my opinion, but I could write a book about better movies than this.Think about the movies you are making this sound better that it. Taxi Driver is not as good as Amélie? A Bridge on the river Kwai? 12 Angry men? Come on people! What were you thinking?"
"Well IMDb insists on at least 10 lines in a review - which is probably more substance than is present in this film. The summary really says it all.The basic plot is - pretty young woman wanders around playing fairly pointless pranks with minimal dialogue. Little character development and her behaviour is not outlandish enough to be really interesting. Her life is too unreal for me to identify with her and her affections seemed shallow and unrooted. Nothing especially exciting, funny or tragic happens.A contrived film in the main, two stars for decent camera-work and a pretty lead actress.My DVD had a hiccup just before the end - it had had enough. So had I."
"Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I expected a lot more. Perhaps the movie itself isn't awful, but it seemed as such to me because it was such a big let down. There was all this hype about a great, funny, quirky French film that was sweeping the nation, and so that's what I expected it to be. In reality, it was painfully formulaic in places and not nearly so delightfully quirky as, say for example, making your bed while listening to music from The Matrix. It was a let down, and not a particularly engaging movie. I would never, never watch it again."
"Maybe it's an age thing, but I found Amelie one of the most annoying movie characters I've met in a long time. After about an hour or so, I was rooting for Nino to drop out of the game.  The Paris scenes were lovely and some of her tricks were fun, i.e. the Gnome, but she was cruel to the greengrocer and just feckless re: manipulating the affair with that maniac.  The paper chase with Nino was just plain tiresome.  Sorry, from A Minority of one."
"There is no dispute of the inventiveness in some parts of the film; the strong cinematography and beautiful music scores but as usual with the director's previous efforts, Amelie is full of freaks who seem to live in another planet, French movieland.The seemless half an hour of introduction is occassionally funny and downright weird most of the time, however, the movie starts to drag on after one hour and Amelie's journey to help others and find her own happiness seems like director's excuse to throw us with too many oddball characters and pointless subplots.For example, at one point, the movie moves from the lead actor's(Mathieu Kassovitz) possible lateness for the date with Amelie in the cafe to being kidnapped by terrorists. Most people will find it hilarious and inventive but I think it's just another freakish and non-sensical idea of the French director. The initially sweet romance of Dominique Pinon with the waitress turning into wild sex in the toilet is tastelessly amusing and could have been edited out altogether. The part of Amelie teaching the mean grocer a lesson by messing up the house is like scenes taken out of a regular Hollywood trashy comedy.
All these strange (notice how many times, the equivalents of ""weird"" are used here and in many critics' reviews) characters and subplots make the last half hour of Amelie like an eternity. Many times, I wish the movie could just finish off before 2 hours. Mind you I'm the sucker for 2 hours over drama.This movie is a love it or hate it movie. For those looking for a fun ride and something different from mainstream cinema, Amelie may be a treat. For someone like me who have to care for the characters in order to indulge in the movie, Amelie is just a cold art fare.  My rating 3 out of 10.
One of my favorite foreign language films this year is ""A Time For Drunken Horses"" from Iran....(A view of a chinese in London)"
"The photo booth repair man is in the pictures.Amelie should just ask the guy for his phone number....straight away.Not really a bad film, but not as good as 50% scoring it a 10.Le chevalier sur le toit is much better than this and also Les visiteurs."
"I thought I had rented a winner for the evening with the wife, well she didn't make it past the 6th chapter.  I endured the whole thing so that I could fairly give it a 1(awful).  Take Chocolat, the Dish, and similar movies about the meaningless musings of life in a socialist society and cut in half.  I will give a positive to the pranks Amelie pulled but that is the best I can do.  One of the four least favorite films I've ever watched."
