"Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this ""through the looking glass"" work, which examines the dream-like nature of filmor is it the film-like nature of dreams? As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or ""cartoon"" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a filmbut this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is ""real"" and an inner film that is ""not real,"" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choiceand a responsibilityto clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, ""How in hell did he do that?"" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the ""real"" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster ""shadows"" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady. This is Keaton's most trenchant bit of social satire: whose ideas of kissing and love-making haven't been influenced by what they see at the movies?"
"It's almost impossible to describe the astounding creativity of ""Sherlock, Jr"".  Even for Buster Keaton, this is a tremendous display of comedic and fantasy material.  What's so remarkable is not so much any particularly hilarious gag or gags, as the never-ending stream of amazing and entertaining sights - coming faster and faster as the film proceeds - that seem so off-hand and effortlessly inventive, but that must have involved many hours of painstaking work to perfect.  The film vs. reality theme is also highly suggestive, and makes this great movie one of the most completely satisfying efforts by Keaton or anyone else.The film opens slowly and allows the pace to build gradually.  Buster operates the movie projector at a theater, while trying to study on his own to be a detective.  He is involved in a real-life mystery that involves his girlfriend's family, and which turns out badly for him.  He retreats into the fantasy world of a picture showing at his theater, and from then on you just have to see it to appreciate it.  The creative comedy, the technical skill, and the subtly expressed themes are all remarkable.This is a great experience not to be missed."
"Not only is this Buster Keaton's best film, but it is among the greatest achievements in the history of cinema, period. While it is not a feature-length film--and thus barred from most critics' lists of great films--it invented just about every single basic special effect known to movies (except for morphing). The story itself, about a film projectionist who desires to become part of the movies, and then does, by walking right onto the screen, made palpable the desire that we all have to be in the movies: To get the girl, to be an action hero, to outsmart the bad guys. Keaton invented meta-cinema before anyone even had a phrase for it.This movie has entered our dreams."
"This Keaton classic is both funny and extremely clever in its construction. Our hero is a cleaner but dreams of becoming a detective, always with his nose buried in a book on the subject.The first third of the film is much like any other comedy. There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster's father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son's films.There's a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.It is in Junior's other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.Sherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.Justly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton's cinematic career. It is a film worth watching and has stood up well today."
"I have to say that this is by far Keaton's finest work. I have seen and own about 19 of his films/short films and this is the one that truly stands out.It is rare these days to find a comedy which will make you laugh each and every time you see it. Yet this one, to me, seems not only to be able to do this but also to get BETTER the more you watch it.The physical comedy, sight gags and insane stunts never cease to amaze me. That is what I love about Buster, the fact he did his own stunts shows that he was a great believer in producing a film that was genuine, that didnt try to trick or fool it's audience.I find it sad that today most people seem to think that comedy is about dialouge and punch lines, when it is clear from film master pieces such as Sherlock Jr. that this is not true. Silent movies are not to be ignored just because they are 'old', when I watch many of them they feel as fresh as any new comedy - if not more so.So thank-you Buster!"
"Though a lot of older films tend to be neglected, Sherlock Jr. definitely isn't a film that could be called obscure. I imagine most people at least know OF this movie with its famous movie-in-a-movie surrealist scene.Still, having previously heard over and over again about the brilliance of this film, I never really understood until I saw it myself. It's not just the dream-story and the surreality, it's what Keaton does with it and the importance he places on cinema. This film is even rather unique in using montage in a new way, or showing how much film appeals to the imagination as much as an artistic endeavor.Thus, this film itself becomes both wildly imaginative and brilliantly artistic... and best of all, it's FUNNY! Thus, it becomes a film for everyone. There's no hard-found artistic conceit that leads to cries of ""Pretentious!"", but still people can say ""It's amazing."" There's no comedic conceit that says, ""Bah, just simple slapstick, it's low-culture!"" because it's rather intelligently done. And it's creative in a way that isn't like an opium-dream. It can appeal to anybody of all ages. It's one very well-done film.--PolarisDiB"
"As I sat reading the other reviewers comments I wondered what I could add. Oddly enough I watched Sherlock jr only this afternoon, after so many viewings it still amazes me how far ahead of his time Buster Keaton was, often copied, rarely equalled never surpassed. I would hate to be the kind of movie fan who never watches silent or black and white movies (you'd be surprised how many there are). So if you are like that do yourself a favour, get hold of a copy of this movie and enjoy, it shocks me that films such as 'Something about Mary' are rated higher than this masterpiece of comedy, there is nothing wrong with 'SaM' even I laughed at it, but, watching it once was enough, however I watch Sherlock jr again and again in pure amazement at Buster Keaton and his cameraman, Elgin Lessley's achievements without the aid of modern technology, like most other's the scene where he dives through a window to reappear as a little old lady gobsmacks me, how did he do it? Keaton can only be described in one word, genius. I have to add that I have the Kino version on DVD with the appalling soundtrack, but, luckily I also have it with a more appropriate soundtrack, which is far superior and adds extra enjoyment to an already fabulous movie."
"There ought to be a theater that shows nothing but perfectly preserved prints of the silent comedies of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Harry Langdon. There ought to be a lot of things, I guess. But anyone who thinks that silent film is nothing more than a crude and unskilled ancestor of today's motion picture need only spend some time on these great comedies to realize that, in this genre at least, the peak was reached in the 20s. Yes, there are funny movies with dialogue, but the humor is generally IN the dialogue...nobody--not the Marx Brothers, or W.C. Fields, or Abbot and Costello or the Three Stooges and nobody since--has achieved the sublime mastery of physical comedy these geniuses did. And the best of them all for pure comedy, to my mind, is Keaton. And the best of his movies is Sherlock, Jr. The dream sequence in which he becomes an actor in the film he's projecting is astonishing; the way in which this movie is a sort of window into a different and appealing age is charming--and the ending of this movie takes the breath away. Keaton made some of the great endings in film, I think. Check out ""College"" some time--just for the last minute or so. If you ever have the chance to see this film in a good print at the right speed with appropriate music, and you don't take that opportunity, shame shame shame. This is one I'd like to own."
The best silent I have seen yet.. Buster Keaton's a film genius for making a movie like this.. the scenes where the film surroundings change while Buster is in the film is hilarious and even seems hard to make as a realistic special effect today. His stunts are great and its amazing that he did them himself. They're all perfectly timed and done and look as hard as they must be. This movie is one of the best.. Not a single sound the whole movie and I enjoyed it greatly.. Keaton is without a doubt the best comedian.. better than Chaplin or anyone else.
"Am somebody who likes humour with wit and sophistication when it comes to comedy (that's why so many pre-1970 comedy appeals a lot to me), while appreciating comedies with a broader style providing it doesn't become too vulgar and the risque kind. Have found though that in recent years that there has been those that are very juvenile, crude and even puerile to the point of offensiveness, which is as one may have guessed appeals to me far less.There are many fine examples of silent film comedy, with Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy though in both cases it wasn't the case of finding their feet immediately. In both cases the early stuff was fairly hit and miss, but when they did settle their best work was classic. And of course Buster Keaton, who didn't transition as well or smoothly into the sound era (whereas Chaplin made some of his best work in it) but when he was in his prime there was nobody back then, when it came to comedy, more daring in terms of the jaw-dropping stunt-work, or who was able to make deadpan funny and expressive, and actually it is still like that now. Keaton wasn't nicknamed ""The Great Stone Face"" for nothing, and in my mind he was every bit as funny and easy to like as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, while also being a bigger risk taker, having bolder material physically and his films being technically in his prime period superior. The reasons for the comparisons being because they were all geniuses in comedy, who started their careers around the same time, a lot of the comedy was physical rather than verbal and their prime periods were in roughly the same time period.'Sherlock Jr' is another one of Keaton's finest, an achievement in pretty much every way. On a technical level, it is one of his most audacious and best-looking along with the slightly more ground-breaking on this front 'The General'. Again, it is beautifully shot and designed and the effects and how they're used stand out, it should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly, rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now. Films today should learn from this film and the best of Keaton, they really are an example to all in many senses. The direction keeps things moving with control, progressing gradually and always assuredly, and balances everything beautifully.When it comes to the humour, 'Sherlock Jr' is one of Keaton's funniest and most inventive, chockful of hilarious moments timed to absolute perfection. While none of the stunts are quite on the same level of awe-inspiring as for example the climax of 'Steamboat Bill, Jr', they are still incredibly daring. Also found myself surprisingly educated, which makes this film one of Keaton's more interesting films, in learning the trade tricks in editing and effects and some of the most genius use of back projection (often done cheaply and obviously, but inventively done here).Like 'The General' and 'Steamboat Bill, Jr' it is really great to have a story with brains, heart and logic, treating the audience with respect and there is never any trouble following it. In terms of structure it stands out too when it comes to the story elements in Keaton's films and is one of the most interesting. The romantic element that features heavily here is done with more charm and pathos than most comedy when balanced with romance, without being too sentimental or soap-operatic, never does it slow the film down either. As to be expected, Keaton as to be expected is superb here, not only is his comic timing on point but he once again provides a character that's endearing and worth rooting for. His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is awe-inspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced. Don't overlook the rest of the cast though, they may not have as much to do but they are also amusing and charming.In summary, one of the Keaton essentials. 10/10"
"Sherlock, Jr. arguably exceeds The General as Buster Keaton's greatest achievement -- it is certainly more magical in its use of extraordinary special effects and unconventionally humorous situations.  Movies about movies are a dime a dozen, but rather difficult to do well.  Keaton's brilliant structuring of the story -- a fantastic treat for audiences when his pathetic projectionist becomes the genius detective through a literal entering of the movie screen -- has been imitated dozens of times, but I always come back to this unsurpassable rendering.  Watching Keaton play the scene where he studies how to go about kissing his best girl by peeking at a movie version of the same event always reduces me to simultaneous jags of tears and laughter."
"My second silent film for the class that I viewed for my class was just as entertaining as the first, which was Charlie Chaplin's The Circus. Buster Keaton playing the role of the movie projectionist Sherlock Jr. was very entertaining. The story is simple, yet interesting and fun, and the movie comes in at much less than one hour, 44 minutes to be exact. While there are a few points in the movie that are disjointed and not as fun, overall you can stay engrossed enough until you get to some really cool and innovative special effects, which given the technological limitations when this was filmed in the 1920's are simply amazing."
"Spoilers herein.I am an enthusiast of what I call ""folding"" in film. That's the collection of techniques that map some awareness or identification of what the film is, to the story within the film. It isn't just a simple game, but a complex system of juggling representations and reality. It is not unique to film of course -- it has a long literary tradition. But it is one of the few things that characterize film as an agent of our imagination. I have built a database of hundreds of wonderful examples of folded films.It all starts here. Even today, the medium is still young and quickly evolving. But when this was made, film was still indistinct from its siblings: theater and still photography. Griffith had hampered the evolution by introducing one feature (societal scope -- unachievable on stage) by freezing another (ALL of the other conventions of stage).Keaton's notion of a film within a film seems ordinary today. Today, we don't even blink at one of the effects in this film: Keaton (in his film-within persona) is planning an elaborate getaway through a window in a cabin. To see this getaway, you need to see the inside and outside. Since this is explicitly a movie, we see the cabin the way it was built for a movie: with one side missing. Is is, in effect a film within a film within a film. This now common notion all starts here, it seems.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this"
"This movie is breathtaking and astounding. You've heard those things before, but not from me. Today we have few films that combine special effects with a riveting story. Some would say Star Wars did so, and I'd agree to a certain extent, but no movie that I've ever seen work a story integrated with special effects like this one. If you aren't as amazed by this tour de force as I am, check your pulse. You're dead."
"Sherlock, Jr. (1924)If you think silent films are stupid or simplistic, check this out. Not only is it clever and fast and well done, it's short (well under an hour) so you won't have to panic.Buster Keaton is one of the big three silent film comedians (along with Chaplin and Lloyd). And all three were an influence on Woody Allen. In this case, you can see the most astonishing use of the film work and the real world getting mixed up. Remember that Allen film, ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" where the character on the screen steps into the real world, and things go nuts? Well, that's the key startling premise here--Keaton plays a projectionist who (in his dream) jumps up on the screen and into the movie.On top of this are classic Keaton comic moments, a plot that has at least three threads (one is in the movie on the screen), and a kind of post-modern love story. Keaton is an understated actor with is face, and overstated with his body. That is, he doesn't push the comic expressions but he really knows how to make his body language work.The Netflix streamable version is a Kino release and it's really very good, with music that makes sense. (The music is always added much later, but Kino releases usually choose scores that might match a better performance from the time, when of course the music was live in the theater.)"
"Though a silent film aficionado, I've only recently been getting into the comedies of the twenties. Sherlock, Jr. was my first taste of Buster Keaton, and thank god for it is the best place to start. Like Bill Murray or Bob Newhart, Keaton's humor is based on perfectly timed lack of expression, which can convey more than anything said or done by a more animated comedian. Unlike those other stone faces, Keaton is also an action hero, constantly jumping off cliffs, hopping moving trains, riding the handle bars of a speeding bicycle, throwing himself through windows, all without the aid of a stunt double. The seamlessness of the camera trickery is mind-blowing, and the post-modern breaking-the-fourth wall philosophy has been the subject of an entire book published by Cambridge. But despite all the leaps, falls, and technical wizardry, the funniest moment in the film is when Buster kisses the girl, which must be one of the most awkward-yet-endearing love scene ever put on film."
This film is one of the zeniths of an art of silent cinema sadly lost on most filmmakers today. Keaton's ability to have your sides aching with laughter one second and your heart breaking with empathy for this little lost man the next is unsurpassed.
"There is a special effect in this film - made so many decades ago - that still amazes viewers.  In one scene, Keaton is chased through a house, wearing men's clothing.  He dives through a window, in a continuous tracking shot, and emerges fully dressed as an old woman.  Watch it in slo-mo on your VCR.  It will astound you.The entire, brilliant film will astound"
"A film that is often copied, borrowed from and imitated but can never be surpassed.  The technical special effects teams assembled for today's movies couldn't possibly capture the nuances or spirit of Keaton's truly astounding stunts all performed with a precision that would shame a brain-surgeon.There was never a greater artist working in silent film than Keaton and it is to the AFI's ever-lasting shame that none of his films (but especially this one) were named to their so-called 100 Greatest Films list.  How myopic and dim-witted can they be?"
"Buster Keaton has cajones the size of watermelons. This isn't just to say in the stunts that he executes- sometimes, apparently, to great physical and personal risk- are at big comic peril, but that he's fearless with what he wants to try as a filmmaker and scenarist. Jokes that I thought would never really be fresh are taken in 1924 in ways I didn't think could be funny, but are. Take a small bit where Keaton's character (one of them, anyway) plans to sabotage a nefarious guy with a slip on the banana peel. For a moment this is groan-inducing, but watching how it's executed it becomes something really, really gut-busting. There are little bits like that, and then those huge scenes of choreographed mayhem: a blast by water after hanging off of a moving train, a chase through a town that includes a sudden chance of a road connected, jumps through small holes and windows at the nick of time that are half pure Keaton and half exciting editing.And then Keaton himself, usually a little guy looking shy and quiet and a dreamer in the greatest cinematic sense (this was one of the first, if not the first, films to have a character go into a movie-world right through the screen), and he's always incredibly subtle but not ever lacking appropriate comic timing. And in Sherlock Jr he operates wonderfully on two wavelengths: one is as the character just trying to hold the girl's hand on the couch without much embarrassment, and the other is as the title character, going up in peculiar fashion up to everyone in the room (as is one of the listed things ""to do"" as a detective) and suave with things like an explosive 13 ball on the pool table. Keaton is, as Ebert noticed, the one little guy wandering around in the chaos. Only this time, in such a short running time for a feature (it's just a few minutes short of being a short film), Keaton crams as much as he can to perfect effect.Sherlock Jr should be seen by just about anyone looking for a great example of pure silent-comedy hijinks and stunt work; what Jackie Chan might be for martial arts Buster Keaton is to a crazy pratfall, and you often can't entirely believe it's the guy on screen doing what's being done. And it's also, alongside Steamboat Bill Jr and The General, examples of how Keaton could be an exemplary filmmaker, someone who took film technique and shook it up just a bit (if, admittedly, more-so than Chaplin as just director if not quite as a star), while sticking faithfully to comedy and heart-tugging moments. And if you're tuned into the mania and well-oiled machine of the stunt sequences and classic chase climax it's as pleasurable as anything in comedy history, nevermind just silent film. Make sure, by the way, to watch the Kino version (at least the one on VHS which I saw) to see one of the most enjoyably strange scores for a silent film- there's even the blues hit You Got to Move at one point!"
"Yes, counting all the comedies I've ever seen, silent or talkie, this is probably the funniest. I was lucky (boy, was I lucky!) to see this in a theater with a live piano player. Ever scene is brimming with comic genius, cinematic inventiveness, and just plain perfection. I laughed almost nonstop from beginning to ending. Jokes that seem liked they lasted 10 minutes were funny for their entirety. After the performance was done, I think the audience clapped for 10 minutes, and they (the pianist and Buster Keaton) deserved at least that much, if not an hour more. 10/10"
"""We are lost! He is sending for the world's greatest detective - Sherlock Jr.!""After watching several of Chaplin's classic films, I decided it was time to give Buster Keaton an opportunity beginning with one of his most revered movies, Sherlock Jr. Keaton and Chaplin dominated the silent movie era, but most people are divisive as to who was the most talented actor-director of that time. So far I'm on Chaplin's side although I still have to give Keaton another shot with The General. Perhaps the problem I had with Sherlock Jr. is that I'm not a big fan of surreal films. I know everyone seems to love this genre, but there are very few surreal movies that work for me. I can see how Buster Keaton garners recognition for his magical work in this film, being one of the first to actually incorporate dream sequences into his movie. Many other films (and especially cartoons) were inspired from several scenes in Sherlock Jr, like the one in which Keaton's character jumps into a movie screen and becomes a character in the movie that is being projected (better known as ""the movie within a movie"" sequence). There are several action scenes including some spectacular chases that make you wonder how Keaton could have shot them way back in 1924. I was more impressed with this wizard like aspect of Keaton than on his comedic performance. His deadpan expressions were outdone by the gadgets he devised to create such advanced special effects. Despite being bored by the story, I have to give Keaton credit for his inventive and magical sequences. At the beginning of this silent film, written by Jean Havez, Joseph Mitchell, and Clyde Bruckman the title card reads: ""There is an old proverb which says: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both. This is the story of a boy who tried it. While employed as a moving picture operator in a small town theater he was also studying to be a detective."" We are then introduced to the projectionist (Buster Keaton) who is reading a detective book instead of cleaning up the theater. After work, he goes to visit his girl (Kathryn McGuire) and buys her a ring. Another man (played by Ward Crane), who is also fighting for the girl's affection happens to be at the house and steals her father's chain watch and incriminates the projectionist. The girl's father (Joe Keaton) kicks him out of his home and tells him never to return again. The projectionist sadly returns to work where he falls asleep and dreams of being a detective in the film that is being projected. In his dreams, he becomes the hero of the film and the adventure begins.Buster Keaton's film has some brilliant and magical sequences, and I think it is a bit unfair to compare him with Chaplin because he has a very different style. Chaplin has a more humane approach, writes his own stories and composes them as well, while Keaton does some impressive work behind the lens using some trickery. As performers they both have different styles, Chaplin uses a lot of physical comedy while Keaton uses deadpan humor and incorporates a lot of action scenes doing some risky stunts (in the train sequence he actually fractured his neck). Depending on which style you like best, you will probably claim Keaton or Chaplin is better, but it would be unfair to say one is less talented than the other because they both proved to be geniuses during the silent era and have left us with a rich legacy. I can see sparks of both in contemporary film making. Despite not being a fan of this film as much as others I still need to watch Keaton's The General to get a clearer picture of his style."
"Monday September 12, 2005 7:00pm The Seattle Paramount Theater""Say Mr. Detective, before you clean up any mysteries, clean up this theater.""In an age before computer generated effects Sherlock Jr's out of control ride on the handlebars of a motorcycle is astonishing. It is a sequence that could never be duplicated in the modern era. Buster plays a theater projectionist with dreams of becoming a master sleuth. When he loses his girl to ""The Local Sheik"" Buster retreats to a dream world where he literally steps into the movie he is screening and becomes the ""world's greatest detective"". As ""Sherlock Jr."" he dodges exploding billiards, falling blades and poisoned drinks, finally ending up on the motorcycle in what has to be Keaton's best and most unbelievable stunt. As Buster runs down a street he encounters a cop on a motorcycle. The cop threatens to write him a speeding ticket and Buster solicits his help. Jumping on the handlebars they speed along. Why is he running? It doesn't matter. The chase is central to most of Keaton's films. The bike goes over a bump and the cop is bounced, leaving Buster on his own but unaware no one is driving! Attempting to understand how Keaton filmed this sequence is confounding. There are shots in which we can assume he is in control and driving (Keaton's coattails hide his position at one point). There are other shots when the bike is obviously on a truck (a wonderful shot shows Buster racing a train to a crossing). There are still other shots that seem impossible or at least extremely dangerous (Buster speeds along a road as ditch diggers fling dirt in his face). Years later, after an accident, x-rays of his neck revealed spinal fractures that may have been caused by the spills he took shooting this picture. The brilliance and originality of visual gags throughout Sherlock Jr. make it one of Keaton's very best feature films alongside The Cameraman and Seven Chances.Buster finds himself adrift ""Three-and-a-half miles higher than a kite"" in The Balloonatic. While he's there he washes his socks! When the balloon crash lands in the woods Buster is menaced by bears and rescued by a stream fishing cutie in one of Keaton's simplest and most charming two-reelers"
"This is, in my book, Keaton's greatest film -- even better than ""The General,"" and that's saying a lot.  It's hilarious and technically dazzling, especially when you consider the state of special effects when it was made. See it and understand why Buster Keaton has to be considered one of the geniuses of the 20th century."
"009: Sherlock Jr. (1924) - released 4/21/1924, viewed 7/31/05.DOUG: At just 44 minutes, this film starts slow, but once the action picks up, it becomes unforgettable with many of Keaton's most famous stunts. Keaton and his gagmen created bits that I could never imagine; how do you create a scene with a lost dollar bill in a trash pile? How about an exploding pool ball? That scene with the pool table just baffled me. How did he keep from hitting the 13 ball? Did he just glue it in place? Since Keaton plays a projectionist, we get to see the inside of a 1920s movie theater, complete with the little orchestra pit. There's also the climactic bit with Keaton riding on the handlebars of a motorcycle, not knowing that the driver is long gone. After many thrilling stunts (an exploded log, an elevated train track bridged by two trucks, a tug-of-war that goes awry), Keaton finally turns around and finds that he really is driving by the seat of his pants. The finale is a real kicker. And let's not forget the scene where Keaton hangs off the tube connected to the water basin as the water pours out and washes him onto the track (Keaton fractured his neck doing this stunt). Gives new meaning to the warning ""Don't try this at home."" I've found that Keaton's trademark stone-faced expression really does work for the comedy, as we in the audience can just fill in whatever reaction works in our own minds. I'd also like to give props to the movie's soundtrack on the DVD which, according to the credits, was recorded in 1993. It sounds very jazzy and modern.KEVIN: Sherlock, Jr. was AWESOME!!! It's only our second Buster Keaton film and already one of his best. All the gags in this film are top notch. I still don't know how he did some of that stuff, like the stunt where he dives through the suitcase and disappears. Lots of little pointless special effects going on too, like at the beginning of the dream sequence when he walks into the movie and the scenery keeps changing on him. My favorite gag is the bit on the bicycle, when he finally notices that his partner has fallen off and we see something almost (but not quite) like an expression resembling panic on his deadpan face. Again, Keaton's expression is kind of a marvel, as silent stars in those days had to be extremely expressive, while Keaton went the other way. His minimalist look kind of allows the viewer to fill in the appropriate emotion, which brings the audience in on the joke. One of the unusual things about this film was the musical score, which sounds a little too modern (I think I caught an electric guitar in there) but just barely fits with the film's dreamy story. Last film viewed: Thief of Bagdad (1924). Last film chronologically: Girl Shy (1924). Next film: The Navigator (1924).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise."
"This is as close to a perfect movie as you will find. I've shown this film a number of times to classes of juveniles in detention, and after the initial first few minutes of resistance, even this short-attention-span audience, used to instant gratification, and the latest cinematic effects--even this audience, invariably becomes enthralled by Keaton's artistry and film magic.Contemporary artists, like Jackie Chan, have copied much of Keaton's style and many of his stunts. Chan and others have used Keaton's stunt of running on the top of a moving train such that the runner appears stationary to the background. Keaton shows that great film artistry can be achieved with rudimentary technology.Sherlock Jr. will remain on a list of ""must watch"" film classics as long as people are still watching movies."
"Buster Keaton is absolutely brilliant.  I've now seen 4 of his films/short films and am amazed by his work.  He was doing stuff that was way ahead of his time.  That plus his stunt work make the films worth seeing.For example, in this film, there is a bit where he doubles up on-screen by merging film of him sleeping with film of him standing up and moving around. It creates a ghost like image that works very well.  This effect has been seen many times since, and I imagine this is one of the first usages.For stunts the guy was just insane.  One stunt involves a bike riding over a bridge with a gap in the middle.   Two trucks converge on each other below the gap as the bike soars by and uses there roofs to cover the gap.  This happens very quickly and I can only imagine they sped up the film to make it look good, but it's still great looking.There is another scene where he is on a roof, I believe it's about 25 feet up and he needs to get down so he grabs hold of one of those things that stop traffic from crossing train tracks..yeah, you know the ones..they go up and come down in a 90 degree arc.  So it's up, he grabs it and rides it as it arcs down and he lands in a car as it drives off.Go Buster!"
"This is a film that starts out as a very simple story, and then elevates itself to a level of manic hilarity that has rarely been duplicated. Buster Keaton, as he does in every film, has three or four sight gags that are so shocking and startling that you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter (I particularly liked the ""dive through the barn window"" - I won't give it away, but it's insanely hilarious). This is well worth seeing again and again. This is one of Buster's finest films."
"My favorite film second only to ""Annie Hall.""  ""Sherlock, Jr."" is Buster Keaton's masterpiece.  It is very fast-paced.  (It's 44 minutes long.  A frame more and it would not have been as good.)  Buster's comic timing is impeccable.  Also, his stunts are dazzling.  In fact, Jackie Chan once said Buster Keaton was his personal hero.""Sherlock, Jr."" is so good because it is so modern.  Whereas some works of Chaplin are dated and sentimental, Buster Keaton's movies are modern and unsentimental.  Some people call him cynical, but I don't think so.  He's just realistic.The entire movie is funny.  Heck, even the dialogue titles were funny!  His own self-critique notwithstanding, Buster Keaton was a genius, and his genius, resourcefulness, and creativity should never be forgotten."
"this is my fifth keaton classic and i must say that this man is addictive. if you haven't seen any keaton yet, i would implore you to fly, don't run to your nearest vid store or repertory film house. the only warning i issue here, is to watch out for musical scorings by the ""clubfoot orchestra"". their detached musical rendering leaves you wondering WHO, IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD ATTACH THIS HIDEOUS TRACK TO SUCH AWE-INSPIRING FILM MAKING? it's exponentially better with a very simple piano accompaniment.
9/10-blame the clubfooted!"
"I'm one of those people who rates Buster Keaton above Charlie Chaplin, and ""Sherlock Jr."" is one of the reasons why. Keaton's stony-faced modernist holds up better than Chaplin's Victorian crowd-pleaser. In this film, Keaton is wonderful as a film projectionist who imagines himself as a movie hero even as he tries to woo the girl he loves. Although it's only 1924, Keaton evokes the dreamer's love affair with movies as well or better than ""Walter Mitty,"" as the film explores the tenuous boundary between reality and fantasy. It also has a perfect ending. I rate it a 10."
"""Sherlock, Jr."" is a very special Buster Keaton movie about a projectionist who wants to be a professional detective and plays out his fantasy by entering one of the movies he's projecting.""Sherlock, Jr."" would be good anyway, because it's full of witty set pieces and physical stunts that showcase silent comedy at its best. But what makes it special is Keaton's use of the film to communicate his own joy of storytelling through the medium of the movies, and the power film has to transport us into other people's stories and fulfill our own fantasies by vicariously living through them.This movie apparently was Keaton's own personal favorite, and it shows. It's got a personal touch to it that elevates it slightly above other Keaton films. It's also the film that Woody Allen was paying homage to in his 1985 comedy ""The Purple Rose of Cairo.""Grade: A+"
"While I was reading some of the other reviews posted on IMDb about 'Sherlock Jr.,' I came to the conclusion that they all seemed to agree on the same fact- Buster Keaton was certainly a comedian who was ahead of its time. This is my very first Keaton movie I've ever seen, and after seeing it, I can now see why Keaton is viewed to be one of the greatest slapstick comedians not only in cinematic history but in comedic history too (along with Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and the Three Stooges). The plot is simple: a movie theater film projectionist (played by Keaton himself) dreams of becoming a detective. He knows everything on the subject (including how to act like one and what you should do to solve a mystery), but can't seem to find much work around town. Than one day, after an attempt to help his love interest's father find his stolen beloved pocket-watch goes horribly awry, he returns to the theater and dreams that he is in the mystery movie that he is currently showing at the theater and, better yet, that he's THE detective in the mystery movie helping to solve the crime. The plot works great on two different levels. 1. It offers moviegoers a sense of joyous wish fulfillment. I'm pretty sure lots of general everyday people, even back in 1924, wanted to star in movies, even if they knew little about the profession. So 'Sherlock Jr.,' with its plot line about a random guy becoming a part of a movie, manages to fulfill his wish all these people had. And to see this wish be seen acted-out on screen must have been a really cool experience for moviegoers back in 1924. Especially when they saw the groundbreaking sequence where the hero's ""dream-self' enters the ""movie"" by literally walking into the screen. In this scene the movie's cinematography and special effects were on full display and while it may not look like much today, back in 1924 it was simply amazing. The funny thing about this story is that it's a commonplace story in media today. So 'Sherlock Jr.' really was ahead of its time with its story of joyous wish fulfillment and will forever have its legacy on the plot device. The story also utilizes a sort of film-within-a-film gimmick that is also commonplace in today's media and can be seen in everything from the TV series '30 Rock' to the movie 'The Truman Show.' The cool thing though is that 'Sherlock Jr.' was probably the first piece of media in history to utilize this surreal gimmick, and even though it is actually a dream sequence and not an actual full-blown ""fantasy thingy,"" 'Sherlock Jr.' nonetheless was still pretty much the first piece of entertainment media to use this plot device (or a rough draft of the plot device, more like it) and will forever have its legacy imprinted on it. Plus, the film vs. reality theme that appears in the movie is really funny. When Keaton's character's wakes-up from his dream back into the real world you can't help but have a tragic laugh at his expense. Keaton's performance is also great. He manages to convey the role of the everyman with a big dream perfectly with that constantly glum look on his face- the result of reality wearing-down on him. And he's also funny to watch as he reacts to every situation he is put through. Now on to the comedy seen in the movie. Today, slapstick comedy has been reduced to a type of comedy only seen in crude kids movies. All the life has been sucked out of it. After 'Jackass: The Movie,' it seems like nobody can do nothing new with it. But in the 20s and 30s, slapstick was all the rage. Charlie Chaplin, Keaton, the Three Stooges, Harold Lloyd. and the Marx Brothers did wonders with it. And this movie is an example of slapstick at its finest. From the famous water-tower scene (which actually caused Keaton to fracture his neck, though he ended-up okay) to the suspenseful, trick-shot-filled, game of pool scene to the ""tail your man closely"" scene, the slapstick in 'Sherlock Jr.' is simply marvelous. And it just enters a new realm of quality once you remember that a lot of actors in this movie (including Keaton himself) did most of their own stunts. The movie is also full to the brim with lots of hilarious gags too, such as the introductory scene of ""Sherlock Jr.'s"" assistant Gillette, which is packed with wry jokes about shaving companies and the scene where the hero first meets his love interest and finds that they both keep on trying awkwardly to hold hands and the tour-de-force of gags that is the grand finale car chase scene where everything humorously keeps going the hero's way- until he realizes that his car has only two breaks and the tires on his car require four breaks to stop. The humor in this movie, looking back, is also a great example of the incongruity theory of humor, which states that most basic comedy is created out of a defiance of expectation (the game of pool scene is a great example of this) as the hero humorously never manages to hit the trick explosive ball the villains have planted for him but instead keeps on making trick shots). Now, before I close this review, I would like to talk about three more good things that this movie has: special effects, editing, and cinematography. The special effects in this movie are simply breathtaking. From seeing the hero's dream self leave his body to the scene where the hero magically jumps through Gillette's dress (he's dressed-up as an old woman) into a sliding door, special effects supervisor for this film Elgin Lessley managed to push the technological boundaries for movies at the time with the ahead-of-their-time special effects seen in this movie, which somehow still amaze to this day. He also managed to introduce several new types of special effects to the movie industry. And while the cinematography and editing in this movie aren't nearly as impressive as the special effects, they are still impressive. The wide-open-shots seen during the scene where the hero's ""dream self"" enters the ""movie"" are dimply breathtaking and the frantic, fast-paced shots of camera seen during the grand finale chase scene create a sense of, albeit comedic, suspense and intrigue. And the equally fast-paced, precise, top-notch editing makes sure that audiences are never worn-down by the amount of action happening in front of them. In conclusion, 'Sherlock Jr.' is a great, charming silent-era film with a simple yet timeless story that was also the first Hollywood movie to offer audiences joyous wish fulfillment while also utilizing an at-the-time new surreal yet entertaining film-within-a-film structure. And it keeps the entertainment up with classic slapstick, a charming, funny lead in the form of Buster Keaton, fast-paced, hilarious gags, at-the-time technologically groundbreaking, fun-to-watch special effects, fast-paced, frantic cinematography, and slick, precise editing. It is a must-see for movie-buffs, comedy-buffs, or for families who just want to find a good movie to watch for movie night."
"This movie is amazing! It reminded me of the physical comedy that is used in todays movies and even cartoons. I could tell that a lot of directors today are influenced by Keaton. This movie has it all, it has action, love, greed, comedy and innocence. I think this movie is way ahead of its time. I found myself saying ""wow"" to certain parts because I was not expecting certain things to happen. I think Buster Keaton is pure genius, the originality of this movie is amazing. Sherlock Jr. never has a dull moment."
"While this isn't even my favourite Buster Keaton film, it is still groundbreaking material. In a time period where there were endless possibilities because films were relatively new, Buster was exuding creativity, most notably from a technical standpoint. There are many stunts on this film that account for his ingeniousness and inventiveness, for example Buster leaping through the body of his assistant, Gillette in order to escape the gangsters; the 'movie within a movie' part which was absolutely brilliant; the motorcycle stunt which was
phenomenal; to name a few, I mean Buster was an incredibly talented performer, you could even say he was a magician, for the work he did on this film feels ethereal, dream-like and magical, even though it is essentially
a detective story. Or better yet, a story of an enthusiastic man who dreams of becoming a detective. He is kind of sloppy and above all things, he's been blessed by luck.A fantastic example of the magic of cinema, by one of its most underrated eminences, if that makes any sense. I suggest you watching The General, or my favourite film of his, ever, The Cameraman. Is the stuff that dreams
are made of. You can't possibly regret it."
"This was an exceptional film taking into account the black and white aspect and it being a silent film. Buster Keaton was able to create two plots in one movie, one in reality and one in a dream, and wrap both of them up in under 45-minutes. On top of that he was able to keep the viewer intrigued due to the quickness of certain scenes and the thrown in comedy, like the banana peel which is a classic, which prevented the viewer from getting bored. This film is a classic case of mistaken identity. Someone commits a crime and then plants evidence on the protagonist. This main character was then automatically blamed, lost the girl and then told to get out. He attempted to prove his innocence but couldn't find the evidence he needed (because it was planted on him). Now the next part has a bit of a twist. Instead of him finding a way to prove his innocence he goes to work at a movie theater and falls asleep and into a dream. In this dream he's in a movie as ""Sherlock Jr."" (the detective he always wanted to be). This was a clever turn of events on Buster Keaton's part. He gets called in on a pearl robbery, figures out who stole it, got the pearls back, and saved the girl. When he is abruptly awoken, the girl is there because she was sent by her father with an apology of their incorrect accusation. The transitions between the dream and reality was very well written and performed. It allowed the viewers to understand what was going on without the use of dialogue cards. Factoring in the character expressions and performances, it was clear what was going on without too many intertitles. Which helped keep the film moving. Overall, I would give this film a 9/10 for the overall quality and cinematic cleverness. I personally am not a big fan of these types of movies. Therefore, if I was basing it more on an enjoyable film to my taste I would give it an 8/10 but I'll stick with the cinematic aspect of it."
"This movie didn't wow me while I was watching it. As they go, it isn't really notable until you realize how it had to have been made-- the hours literally cutting and pasting actual film and the effort put in to make some stunts happen are the remarkable parts. By today's standards the plot is akin to a children's book, but the comedy has aged well. The conclusion to the movie seems rushed or sudden, perhaps since the climax and most of the action happens while the main character is sleeping. That said, the visual effects around the dream portion are respectable for the time and the gags and laughs are strong. Worth a watch if you're willing to forgive the pioneer's flaws."
"This movie was very delightful to watch even though it was a silent movie. The plot was well put together even though at some points one felt as if Sherlock would have no chance at the girl or proving that he were innocent. This made me pity him, but also respect this character as he was quite a determined man. In the end, Sherlock does win the girl however, who realizes that he was innocent and went back to him at the theatre. This leaves the audience with the idea in the back of their minds, that things can actually work out no matter how dim or gloomy the chances may seem."
"In Sherlock, Jr., Buster Keaton plays a movie theater projectionist and a janitor who is also studying to be a detective at the same time. He is down on his luck and everything just doesn't seem to work out for him. He is in love with a girl (Kathryn McGuire) but he also has someone also trying to get her as well (Ward Crane). The first 15 minutes of this 45 minute film is filled with wonderful, genuine gags and pieces of comedy that just feel so right. If you aren't laughing or at least cracking a smile, something isn't right. Buster Keaton with his deadpan face carry this film from simple gags of slipping on bananas to the complexities of a billiards ball that is a bomb, that is the range of comedy in this film. After the first 15 minutes, Buster Keaton falls asleep while at his projectionist job and he begins to dream that he has become the ""greatest"" detective in the movie he was projecting. This leads to a fun series of bad detective work and more great physical comedy. I've seen a few of Keaton's films, The General being one of them. While I enjoy The General, I found myself laughing much more during this film and just found everything about this lighthearted film to bring a smile to my face. It's a short one but definitely worth a watch for its comedy, its genuineness, and just for being a fun film."
"One of the funniest films of the silent era and my personal favorite Buster Keaton film, Sherlock Jr. is an outstanding work of imagination, slapstick humor & technical craftsmanship by Buster Keaton. Although the beginning and end don't do justice to what this movie is as a whole, the rest of the film is a rip-roaring, roller-coaster ride of laughter that everyone will find immensely satisfying & entertaining. Plus, the movie is only 45 minutes long and has the potential to do more good to you than many 2-hours plus disappointments. Therefore, don't miss out this comedy classic. One of the greatest silent films of all time, Sherlock Jr. is, in my opinion, Buster Keaton's finest work."
"""Sherlock Jr."" is a glorious 44 minutes in the history of silent film. It is Buster Keaton taking to the absolute limit the fun you can have with a movie camera, and the movie's viewers are the lucky recipients of Keaton's over-indulgence.As with most Keaton comedies, the premise is fairly simple. Buster is a movie projectionist vying for the hand of a local girl (Kathryn McGuire). But Buster's romantic rival (Ward Crane) steals a valuable watch from the girl's father (Joe Keaton) and gets the rap pinned on Buster. Defeated, Buster returns to his job, where he falls asleep and ""projects"" himself (as ""crime-busting criminologist Sherlock Jr."") into the melodrama he is projecting on the screen.The set-up is funny enough, with Keaton involved in a number of very funny gags. (One of them included his getting caught in a geyser erupting from a water tower. For years afterward, Keaton suffered blinding headaches for which he had no explanation. Eventually, he discovered he had broken his neck via the water gag.) But once the dream sequence begins, all stops are out. Buster starts by trying to intervene in the melodrama into which he has inserted himself, only to find the scenery changing with his every move. In his book ""The Silent Clowns,"" Walter Kerr reports that movie makers boasted of going to see the movie several times and never being able to discern how Keaton pulled off his photographic stunts. Keaton eventually admitted his secrets to biographer Rudi Blesh, but I have no desire to repeat them here, any more than one would want to divulge how a brilliant magician succeeded in his trickery. Don't try to look for the seams; just glory in the fun.As if that weren't enough, Keaton eventually does one of his most grandiose chase scenes, in which he rides on the handlebars of a driverless motorcycle, resulting in some gasp-inducing shots.(One of the scenes - where Buster narrowly misses getting hit by a train - looks a bit fake; and it is faked, but not in the way you'd expect. Keaton simply filmed the scene in reverse, so that he was in no danger; but Keaton wasn't quite clever enough to make it look un-faked, with the result that the train looks like it's on a rear-projection screen. Still, try to see where else he faked this spectacular chase, and you'll be looking for years.) The final scene, in which the ""real"" Buster wins the girl and then looks to the on-screen movie for romantic guidance, is a perfect closer.Amazingly, ""Sherlock Jr.,"" which has inspired countless filmmakers and was selected for the Library of Congress' National Film Registry in 1991, got only a mixed reception when it was first released. Variety said it was about as funny as ""a hospital operating room."" It was only with the ""Keaton revival"" in the 1950's and '60s that the movie got the acclaim it deserved and has received ever since.For decades, Freudian reviewers have had a field day deconstructing the movie as an exploration of film, the unconscious mind, and just about any psychological topic you can whip up. If that's your idea of a good time, go to town on the movie. Anyone else can simply savor it as a superbly eye-popping comedy."
"A timid young man employed as a ""moving picture operator"" (projectionist) in a small town theater studies to be a detective. He is not too attentive in his job duties. At a confectionery shop he buys his girl a one-dollar box of chocolates. At the house of his girlfriend, he gives her a tiny ring (along with a magnifying glass) and the small box of chocolates. Then his rival – a cad with a mustache – intrudes and cunningly steals a watch from the girl's father's jacket. He goes to the local pawnshop and uses the funds to buy Buster's girl a four-dollar chocolate box. Back at the girl's house, he sneakily slips the pawnshop receipt into Buster's jacket pocket. When the father discovers his missing watch and later the pawnshop receipt in Buster's pocket, he kicks Buster out of his house. Buster, though, shadows his dastardly man real closely until he is discovered and tricked by his adversary. Now we have one of the all-time classic movie scenes. Buster – without a stunt double – runs along the tops of moving train boxcars. He leaps and grabs the release cord of a large water tank spout, gets soaked, rides the water stream down to the ground, and runs away. Years later he learned that he had sustained a fracture of one of his neck bones. No wonder he had headaches! Meanwhile, his girl did her own detective work and discovered the real thief. Failing as a detective, Buster is back to his old job as a projectionist. While he is showing the movie, ""Hearts and Pearls,"" Buster falls asleep. His dream takes him in a surreal way into the film; note how he enters the screen. Then, as each movie scenes change, his situations become appropriately precarious. In the theater movie, a cad (same one as the fellow who stole the watch) at a mansion steals a string of pearls and passes them to the butler to conceal. Then it is announced that the world's greatest detective – Sherlock Jr. – is assigned to find the pearls. The suave and confident Sherlock Jr. is Hearts and Pearls' alter ego of Buster. All the attempts by the cad and butler to do away with Sherlock fail. (The exploding number 13 pool-ball scene is hilarious.) Before long Sherlock is captured by the cad's gang, setting up several classic Keaton scenes. Of course there is the obligatory road chase. See the motorcyclist jump over the split bridges with the large gap covered only by two box trucks. What skill! Meanwhile, back at the mansion, the butler kidnaps the mansion housekeeper (who looks like his ""real-life"" girl). Sherlock, though, after eluding and then defeating the gang, also rescues the housekeeper from the butler in the process. He awakens from his dream. In the operation's room of the theater Buster's girl catches up with him to say that he is in the clear. Awkward Buster emulates his screen hero to gain pointers at the movie's end. There are rings and kisses with both the theater's movie feature and Buster's ""real life"" situation. Then the next movie-in-a movie setting is fast-forwarded and shows twins of screen Sherlock and the heroine. Buster scratches his head. How will he replicate that situation in real life? The End.Buster Keaton may not have known the definition of surrealism, but ""Sherlock Jr."" articulates it well. His genius and skills are irrefutable, as the man is a screen legend. Roger Ebert once wrote that he was the most courageous of the silent screen clowns, especially because of his ""grace under pressure,"" one able to combine comedy and extraordinary physical feats. You can see them here. There is no need to go into all of his other attributes, as you know what they are just by watching his performances. This film is not only one of the greatest movies of Buster Keaton, but also one of the best in cinema history, along with features like ""Our Hospitality,"" ""The General,"" and ""Steamboat Bill."""
"""Sherlock Jr."" is a movie that isn't very strong in story, but makes up for it in comedy. The story is a simple mystery (nothing groundbreaking), but the mystery isn't the reason to see this movie. The reason to see this movie is for Buster Keaton. His stunts are so incredible (even by today's standards) and perfectly paced that you're not only laughing, you're also on the edge of your seat. The highlight of this movie is definitely when Keaton falls asleep at a movie theater, and he dreams that he's in the movie that's playing. This is one of the most imaginative scenes in movie history, and many fantasy movies afterward probably took a lot of inspiration from it. To me, this is Buster Keaton's best film (even better than ""The General). It perfectly showcases everything that made Buster Keaton great; from his stunts to his perfect timing, there is not a dull moment in this film. This is a film that shows exactly why Buster Keaton is one of the greatest movie stars for not only his time, but for all time. ""Sherlock Jr."" is often overshadowed by other movies of its time, but it's one of the best films the silent era has to offer."
"First off I'd like to say that the cinematography in Sherlock Jr is amazing for its time. There are hardly any jumps and the camera is relatively steady. The editing and effects are amazing for the time, and I found myself amazed by the little stunts that Buster Keaton did throughout the film. In terms of the story itself, Sherlock Jr has many interesting concepts. It seemed to me that Keaton's character's life was intentionally made somewhat dull and boring so that the action sequences when he slipped into a dream/the movie he was screening (Another brilliant scene, perfectly set to the sound track of the film) would seem even more thrilling. The 'love story' seemed to be more of an overarching plot that sandwiched the real story and provided an interesting beginning and a happy ending. In the scene where Keaton's character entered the movie, the music controlled the scene rather than the other way around. Sherlock Jr. Just puts forth amazingly innovative ideas for the time and is really a joy to watch."
"I am a die-hard Keatonian. I love Lloyd and Chaplin, don't get me wrong, but Buster Keatons films remain the most enjoyable to me. He, his movies, and his humor is more translatable for today than the other two. Will how-did-they-do-that's ever go out of style? And trust me, there are some of those moments in this movie. Keaton, conditioned by the vaudeville acts of his childhood, is actually on those handlebars alone, no film tricks, he goes through that window and appears on the other side in a dress, HE JUMPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF HIS ASSISTANT. What do you expect though, Harry Houdini was a family friend and a fellow act on the Keatons traveling show. You will watch, pause, rewind, and watch again a few times during this movie, trust me. An excellent start in some ways to the ""Silent Slapstick"" genre, but in other ways, a bad start - you may begin to make unfair comparisons to other movies of the same persuasion. Kino has released all of his work, so if you want more Buster, it's there for the taking. Also, if you can get your hands on it, a special that ran for 13 episodes called ""Hollywood: A Celebration Of The American Silent Film"" in 1980 on the BBC has many clips, both video and audio (gasp!) of Keaton, plus a biography. For where to go from Keaton, try Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times and Gold Rush, Harold Lloyd's Safety Last! and The Freshman, and Keaton's former partner 'Fatty' Arbuckle in any of his shorts that you can find (and while you're at it, thank him for giving Buster his shot at making movies). Also try W.C. Fields, and Max Linder's shorts, if you can ever find any (and for a tragic story, read his biography.)"
"After watching The General, I couldn't wait to get my hands on another Buster Keaton film. Minute for minute, Sherlock Jr. packs in just as many stunts and laughs, all while exploring the boundaries of cinematic creativity.The film follows Keaton as Sherlock Jr., a movie theater projectionist that wants to become a detective. After his girlfriend's watch is stolen, he attempts to solve the case. Unfortunately, he is set up by the thief and subsequently banished from the family. This leads him to return to the theater and dream about being a real detective.Sherlock Jr. explores the frontiers of special effects at the time. The scene where Keaton enters a movie screen and interacts with the things inside of it is simply incredible (not to mention hilarious), even by today standards. The stunt work by Keaton is also priceless.The acting is great across the board (of course, Keaton shines the most). The pacing is flawless; there are no unnecessary dialog cards. With a short running time of 44 minutes, it is perfect for casual entertainment.I would say The General is a more complete masterpiece, but Sherlock Jr. equals it in many regards. If you like movies (and don't mind a bit of the silent stuff), then you will like Sherlock Jr.."
"""Sherlock, Jr."", a 44-minute black and white silent comedy film starring the genius antics and directorial vision of Buster Keaton is a film definitely worth watching. Knowing that this film was made in 1924, well before digital manipulation, makes the physical stunts and gags very impressive to watch throughout. For all Charlie Chaplin fans out there, Keaton is just as good as him in this slapstick performance if not better.The movie opens with a theater projectionist, played by Keaton, sitting reading his book, ""How to be a Detective"" to the dismay of the theater manager. Later, the projectionist is wooing a girl at her house but is in competition with another suitor, the Sheik. The Sheik steals the girl's father's watch, pawns it, and buys a deluxe candy box for the girl. The father (played by Keaton's real life father) announces his stolen watch status to those in the household, which includes the father's handyman. The Sheik sets up the projectionist to take the fall for the theft thereby thwarting the projectionist's attempt to play detective. The projectionist is told never to return. Back in the theater, the depressed projectionist falls asleep while manning the projector that is running a film. A dream sequence follows where the projectionist inserts himself into the film. The combination of scene changes from actual sets to film scenes where the projectionist stays in the same position between changes is cleverly done. The sequence continues as the projectionist, his boss, the girl, the girl's father, the father's hired hand, and the Sheik replace the characters in the theater film. The Sheik, now as the villain, steals the father's pearls and the father phones Sherlock Jr. (Keaton) to solve the crime. Worth watching are the billiard ball scene where Sherlock Jr. doesn't hit the unlucky 13 ball, and the motorbike ride filled with jaw dropping stunts and Sherlock Jr. riding on the handlebars all the while thinking everything is in control.Keaton's performance as the mild mannered projectionist contrasts perfectly with his performance as the can-do-no-wrong Sherlock Jr. The projectionist is at the mercy of everyone while Sherlock Jr. defies all the odds. The only two other performances worth mentioning are the father's hired hand and the theater manager. During the dream sequence both play parts opposite their characters seen in the first segment. The trusted hired hand is the butler in on the pearl theft while the theater manager goes from being the annoyed boss to Sherlock Jr.'s quick costume changing assistant Gillette much like Artemus Gordon in the 'Wild Wild West' TV show.

"Having consumed every on-screen frame of Buster Keaton I could get myself exposed to, from the good and the bad to the occasional cameo and the outright peculiar (yes, that would be you, Samuel Beckett...), I find myself in the position of starting to re-watch the films that I know -- and in the absence of a DVD player, that means seizing upon screenings as and when they show up! Having been subjected to various dodgy projections and mediocre musical accompaniments, I was beginning to harbour a secret, guilty fear that maybe Keaton's comedy, so skilled at taking an unsuspecting audience by surprise, might be lacking in replay value; having had a couple of disappointing experiences with films I'd originally reckoned to be among his second rank, I was getting a little paranoid at the prospect of re-viewing the ones I'd enjoyed the most in the first place.But I needn't have worried. Take a good print, a superlative accompanist and an audience fizzing with festive excitement, and ""Sherlock Jr"" will replicate the same transports of glee and delight as it inspired when it dropped from on high upon my uninitiated head...The film is a story of the impossible, from the moment that dream-Buster taps his sleeping counterpart urgently on the shoulder, and, failing to wake him, unhooks a dream-hat from the wall and sets out to leap into action himself. For a full-blown feature film, it is exceptionally short. And yet in editing it down, Keaton has crammed together such a kaleidoscope of events that the audience is left with no sense of being either cheated or short-changed: in the course of its five reels, and perhaps due to that very breakneck turn of speed, the viewer is infused with the impression of a whole evening's worth of entertainment. It certainly doesn't come across as lacking in length.That said, my own favourites, I confess, lie among Keaton's comedies of character rather than those of stunts; ""Sherlock Jr"" is a little arbitrary in its attempts to include a good gag by all means possible. When Buster finds himself in the middle of a quick-cut sequence that whisks him from ocean to jungle to desert in the blink of an eye -- only to dump him back in the self-same garden in which he began -- I can't help being aware that there is no reason whatsoever for the film ""Hearts and Pearls"" to contain such a bizarre set of landscapes and cut between them with no characters in sight: for me, the joke loses by the somewhat forced air. Normally, when films contain a dream sequence this reflects back in some manner upon the framing action, providing insights for the dreamer or clues to advance subsequent events -- but again, in ""Sherlock Jr"", in retrospect the dream turns out to have been a disappointingly self-contained device, with no effect at all upon the main 'plot', which simply proceeds in the protagonist's absence: it's an insert just for laughs. (And am I the only viewer cursed with an imagination so literal as to wonder how ""Hearts and Pearls"" can successfully reach its final reel without the projectionist once waking up to switch between the two projectors?) In his later work, Keaton's films would rely less on the fantastic, becoming more integrated.But as ever the delight lies in the detail. In the expressions in the reaction shots -- often, but not always, Keaton's own. In his oh-so-earnest attempt to ensure that the girl gets her chocolates with the price tag discreetly upwards, and his suggestion that her ring might appear more impressive when aided by his magnifying-glass. His instant mimicry of his quarry's every move, extending without even missing a stride to an imitative puff on the antagonist's discarded cigar-butt. The characteristic close-up revealing the car's 'four-wheel braking' in the moment before events force him to brake so fiercely that the chassis continues blithely on its way: Keaton's gags come complete with rationale, and are all the funnier for it. Edited, every shot serves its purpose -- this is essence of comedy, with nothing wasted.Ward Crane and Erwin Connelly make a fine double act as the villainous conspirators, in a send-up of melodrama's conventions. And Keaton himself, as always, is a joy to watch, whether endearingly unsure in his approach to courtship or masterfully suave within his dreams. As an actor he is taken more or less for granted -- but every line of his sturdy small body, every expressive shift in that eloquent face serves to tell the story: not only can you understand every word he's saying, but you can see everything he's thinking into the bargain! As a gifted stuntman or gag-writer alone he would have been memorable; but he was far more than that.The famous set-piece scenes have been praised elsewhere, and those I recalled. But I'll conclude with the little snippets that caught me by surprise all over again into laughter and admiration: the twist on the tired old 'sticky paper on my foot' routine, his little joyous skip up the steps to his sweetheart's house, and the way that the motorbike, miraculously steady, suddenly starts to veer as the character realises that no-one was in control...Rest in peace, Buster. Your films are beautiful, and we love them."
"(Mild spoilers)More innovative brilliance from the great Keaton, filled with jaw-dropping sequences, ( my favourite? ... the jump through the window into the old lady costume).Other highlights are: the way Sherlock collars the villain's accomplice; the amazing chase over the gaps in the railway with the collapsing bridge and the cinema sequence with the changing backgrounds.The musical accompaniment supplied on the DVD is ghastly, completely at odds with the mood of the film ...you could do better dipping at random into your CD collection. That said, this extraordinary film still deserves the highest regard."
"one of the greatest comedies ever made. filled with incredibly inventive ideas and spectacular stunt work. this film is nearly 80 years old and can still make todays audience laugh out loud. buster keaton was much more than just a great comedian. he was a genius story teller as well. when buster was at his best as he was in ""sherlock jr"", his films were a work of art. there are only a couple of comedies that i would give the highest rating to. this is one of them.~~~~~10/10"
"This movie contains many many great stunts and effects beyond its day. WHile making this move, Buster Keaton, being the person he is, broke his neck! The stunts are completely terrific and so is the acting. It is hard to apreciate some silent films, but this is a step above the rest!!!"
"This incredible comedy is far, far better than his (oft over- hyped) ""General""!  The special effects and trick photography are astounding for it's day.  There are sooo many incredible bits:  Keaton on the motorcycle, ""jumping thru the window"" (mentioned in other reviews), and actually ENTERING a movie are classic!(There is a scene in which Keaton falls from a watertower, and is blasted onto railroad tracks by the force of the water.  He immediately gets up and starts running away.  Years later, during a physical examination, it was discovered that he had actually BROKEN HIS NECK when his head hit the rail!).You have GOT to see this film; whether you like silents or not!Norm"
"A projectionist (Buster Keaton) is studying to be a detective and is in love with a young lady. When he proposes her, his rival steals the chain watch of her father and incriminates him. The disappointed young projectionist returns to his job and while projecting the film, he dreams on being the detective of the story. Meanwhile, the girl finds the truth and acquits the guilty of the projectionist to her father.""Sherlock Jr."" is a very creative movie and certainly using a technique ahead of time. Buster Keaton acquires amazing special effects for a 1924 movie. The story, the gags, the conclusion, everything works perfectly in this remarkable and hilarious movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Bancando o Águia"" (""Playing the Eagle""  something like being smart)"
"I'm afraid that the legendary ""Sherlock Jnr"" has left me cold. It just not as good as Keaton's other movies (Our Hospitality, Steamboat Bill Jnr, The General) which doesn't feel as forced as this one. It's not that I have anything against surrealism but from the beginning of the ""surreal"" part of the movie (i.e. when he enters the cinema) the movie just stops being good (not that the beginning was all that great as well).Sure, there are great parts (like when he jumps into an old lady's stomach) but eventually they don't amount to much. I'm sorry, I really wanted to love this movie but it just does not stand on its own like most of Keaton's silent movies."
"I had high hopes when I started this film, I was still coming down from a silent film high after watching Charlie Chaplin's The Circus, but my hopes were very quickly dashed upon starting the film. I don't know if I should be looking at it from the perspective of a 1920's moviegoer, but I can't help but feel like they must have been wondering the same things I am.The film begins and ends with Buster Keaton playing a fumbling, awkward projectionist with dreams of becoming a detective. The slapstick fails to arouse even a smirk and the story starts off so bad I'm actually sort of insulted by it. It doesn't take a detective to realize he could have just taken the family to the pawn shop very clearly named on the receipt for the watch and had the owner confirm that Keaton was not the thief immediately after being framed. There, mystery solved. Now I understand that this was simply the set up for the Sherlock Jr section of the film, but that just raises the even more important question of why the writers didn't just cut those beginning and ending portions of the film entirely and dedicate all of the 44 minute run time to Sherlock Jr. That section of the film is remarkably better in every aspect, and already had a set up that worked perfectly fine; A pearl necklace is stolen and Buster Keaton's character is called in to solve the case. This part of the film is actually enjoyable, the gags are amusing and work well, the plot is much more intriguing, and this is where all of the impressive scenes are on display. If this was the entirety of the film, I would have been impressed rather than confused. I actually really enjoyed seeing Sherlock Jr in action. It's a shame the film was dragged down by the reality it didn't need to give itself."
"Sherlock Jr. is on the case, however in this case I thought it was left slightly unsolved. This movie at times made me chuckle, however I thought overall it just lacked something.The slapstick and comedy at times didn't seem to flow with the story line at all or just seemed a bit pointless. This film had some great scenes like the dream sequence however the slapstick routine at the beginning of it just seemed out of place. Though the concept and effects of the sequence in its own right was amazing.Overall this movie had its moments and I did enjoy it. I would recommend someone to watch this mostly for the 2 classic scenes; the dream sequence and the motorcycle chase."
"Having recently enjoyed Keaton's ""The General"" for the first time, I was looking forward to ""Sherlock, Jr.,"" which I understood to be another of his very best. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.One of the wonderful things about ""The General"" was the underlying logic behind everything that happened. In ""Sherlock, Jr.,"" on the other hand, logic progression is only sporadically followed, often leaving the viewer with slapstick for slapstick's sake, and, in the case of the beginning of Keaton's dream in the movie, camera tricks for camera tricks' sake.This is not to say that there aren't some very funny moments in this movie. There are some wonderful gags and sequences, especially the motorcycle sequence. However, to put ""Sherlock, Jr."" on the same level as ""The General"" is, in my opinion, to show a lack of discernment."
"Outstanding, outstanding.  What more can I say?  I can't pick out one scene over the others because it is just one hell of a movie, from beginning to end.  Why this didn't make the AFI Top 100 is a mystery to me.  The special effects are better than anything being churned out on the blue screen today!"
"Along with SUNRISE, the greatest movie from the silent era.  While not stinting on extraordinary sequences of slapstick - the bicycle scene is justly admired and unsurpassed - it is the growing richness of Buster's persona, and the breathtaking analysis of the medium itself that today astonishes.  An anti-detective work ahead of its time, it both celebrates film as a repository of our dreams and desires, and critiques it for engendering passivity.  Crucially, it is very, very funny."
"Directed by Buster Keaton. Starring Buster Keaton, Ward Crane, Kathryn McGuire, Erwin Connelly, Joe Keaton, Ford West.Silent comedy classic from the Great Stone Face, here playing a film projectionist and aspiring detective who gets involved in cases of theft both in his real life and in a dream where he becomes a character within a projected movie (perhaps the first instance of the movie-within-the-movie concept, used numerous times since). Terrific physical comedy showcasing old vaudevillian tricks and daring stuntwork; filmmaking ingenuity and camera tricks galore, features the usual sweet love story and David vs. Goliath interplay with the hero's nemesis. Numerous classic bits, including a potentially explosive billiards game, a runaway motorcycle chase, and Buster walking right into the movie screen and bumbling through a dozen or so different settings/backdrops. Runs a brisk forty-five minutes; compared to most film comedies, that's more than twice the number of laughs in less than half the time! Joe Keaton, who plays the leading lady's well-to-do pops, is Buster's father.90/100"
"Still make me laugh after almost 100 years from when was made. An excellent comedy and action movie, with effects and stunts worthy of all the admiration even today, in 2019. An absolute masterpiece directed by Buster Keaton, which, together with Chaplin, remain the greatest comic artists of all time."
I thought this was a good film to watch. It manages to stay interesting by great acting. Buster Keaton did a great job. Their is camera angles throughout the film I don't like but not a big deal for the time the film was created. The stunts through out the movie also are genius.
"What really stood out to me the most throughout the movie was the stunts and how perfectly executed they were. I enjoyed how the plot grew more throughout the movies and there were all these obstacles (literally) that Sherlock Jr had to overcome. I like how the suspense was being built up when Keaton showed the audience the different ways the bad guys were going to try to murder Sherlock Jr, but nothing seem to work because as we find out later in the movie, he already knew what they were up to. I also liked how we were in the loop for the most part and saw the point of views of the different characters throughout the movie. All around is a quality silent film."
Very entertaining movie with halarious gags and amusing stunts. Really good story with a creative way of telling it. Buster Keaton was a great actor in the movie and made it fun.
"I loved this movie! I really enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. It is interesting how unique this movie is. It is not only about a trivial love story where the male protagonist faces the usual obstacles to conquest the love of the female protagonist. I believe that there are actually two main points that are covered in this movie such as the analysis of the ""modern"" society and the separation between dream and reality, two concepts that are somehow interconnected. This connection is made pretty clear in the first inter title that states ""There is an old proverb which says: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice for both"". The protagonist dreams of himself into a detective movie that is mirror of his real life, of at least how he'd like to be. Busters doesn't take a position or a choice and, especially at the end of the movie, this is portrayed when he takes action only when he sees whatever it is ""suggested"" by the movie. What I really loved of this movie is the process of the narration. It starts with a simple story and then there is a crescendo of events that are emphasized by the incredible use of visual effects that easily engage the viewer from the beginning of the movie to the end. Excellent movie!"
"If you watch some of the other movies that came out in the 20s, you will quickly notice how innovative this movie was. It brought so many new and interesting ideas into what film making can achieve. I really think its worth seeing just for its uniqueness even if silent films aren't really my thing.A poor and simple guy who works as a projectionist, dreams of being a detective."
"I really liked Sherlock Jr. as an entertaining and innovative movie from the earlier days of cinema in America. While it was cheesy at certain times, it was still very much a classic love story. Too often nowadays I find that that cheesy comedies have no story or plot and rely entirely on comedy. Which is often times bad. Sherlock Jr. however integrated comedy into the narration of its story near flawlessly. I was also struck by the innovation of Buster Keaton. Due to the lack of special effects, the movie had to come up with more interesting ways of surprising the audience to both keep them engaged and make them laugh. They couldn't just add anything they wanted in an editing room. Having said all this however, I think it's a good thing that the movie only has a 45 minute run time, because I think that cheesy/slapstick comedy is only funny for so long. On the other hand, if the movie was longer, maybe Keaton would've just come up with some other crazy things to wow us."
"Buster Keaton Sherlock Jr. is a well-made movie for its time. This movie is well balanced and has a good combination of highlights that are funny, creative, impressive. One scene in particularity that was funny is when he awakened his spirit from his sleeping body and somehow gets into the movie that is playing in the theaters. Another scene that I thought was impressive is when he is in the middle of two colliding train carts that hit the hitch, which saves his life. I was very impressed with how the content was made and how you knew what they were talking about without sound."
"Buster Keaton shows such genius in this film. It's a breathtaking moment when he walks into the screen for the movie within a movie, and one of my favorite in all of silent cinema. From there we are treated to lots of impressive stunts, many of which were quite dangerous, as well as nearly nonstop visual playfulness and misdirection. Loved the slick pool play too. An absolute gem."
"I was fortunate enough to watch this movie with live accompaniment from a brass band. This added a layer of entertainment to an already very entertaining movie.Unlike many movies from its era, Sherlock Jr. aged particularly well. Buster Keaton's signature comical stunts are no less hilarious today than they would have been nearly a century ago. Knowing that they were accomplished without CGI or green screens, and with nothing more than practical effects and a lot of guts, makes it amposible not to be awed.The characters are easy to identify and they needn't any words to have meaningful dialogue. As a consequence, this movie can be enjoyed by anyone, in any language, of any age."
"Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this ""through the looking glass"" work, which examines the dream-like nature of film-or is it the film-like nature of dreams?As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or ""cartoon"" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a film-but this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is ""real"" and an inner film that is ""not real,"" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choice-and a responsibility-to clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, ""How in hell did he do that?"" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the ""real"" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster ""shadows"" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady. This is Keaton's most trenchant bit of social satire: whose ideas of kissing and love-making haven't been influenced by what they see at the movies?"
"Its easy to forget that movies used to be made without sound! Buster has a talent for conveying meaning with non-verbal cues. This movie shall remain a timeless classic, his character is honest, noble and easy to love. This dreamy love story will keep you on your toes. However I did dislike the violence displayed towards women, but I suppose these actions were normalized in this time period (the 20's)."
"This short silent film is in my opinion Buster Keaton's best work and also very funny, showing off his great physical comedy skills. Not only that but people don't seem to realize that this silly short comedy actually invented a ton of special effects that became common in film for the rest of the century."
"Keaton knows how to keep an audience engaged. He effectively incorporates comedy, romance and crime fighting into this film. Using a movie within a movie is an ingenious way to enhance the confidence of the character while solving the crime and winning the girl. The music worked well in maintaining the momentum of the film."
