Reviews
"This is an extremely quirky film, riddled with crazy caricatures of East European mafiosi and small time crooks. It sports some of the most imaginative characters I have ever seen on a screen (a woman who pulls nails with her buttocks?) and some of the most bizarre scenes.And yet the film is beautifully balanced, never falling into outright lunacy or losing the plot.
The scenes are at times almost nostalgic, a throwback to some simpler time when you could just have fun, no holds barred. And that is exactly what this film does for me - I have not had as much fun in ages. You will leave the theater with a feel-good factor 10 and thank out loud the people who created this gem.Kusturica is a phenomenon."
"Few films just simply fascinate me. As an American Boomer, I am admittedly spoiled and quite jaded, when it comes to movies. This film tantalized me and enthralled me. I felt like a kid at a carnival. The rich cinematography was palpable. The beauty of the chaotic and very non-Pasteurized world of these kooky gypsies and country folk was unexpectedly stunning. And it was so funny! Just plain old funny! The acting was superb. I recognized some favorite character actors from other films I have seen from Yugoslavia. (Look for the Nail Lady). The only glitch for me was an occasional sense that the subtitles could not convey the full impact of the obviously earthy and colloquial dialogue. The film seems to proudly carry on the zany comedy tradition of Europe in the sixties, such as the Pink Panther series and the Czech ""Firemen's Ball"". I regret I did not see this in a theater with the howling audience it deserves."
"""Underground"" may still be the most monumental and brilliant work from Kusturica, yet this movie is just so damn feel-good and enjoyable that the man earns my highest praises yet again. Being a sort of comedic parallel to ""Time of the Gypsies,"" old ways clash with the new in this hilarious comedy about Gypsies living on the bank of Danube river.  Gangsters, dirty deals, weddings, eccentric characters, great music (played by the  orchestra from ""Underground""), delicious Eastern European atmosphere - ""Black cat, white cat"" has it all.  I love it. Kusturica is a master of his craft. I tink, dis is de begining of a beautiful frendship..."
"Emir Kusturica's films all pulsate wildly to the wonderful sounds of authentic gypsy music. Guitars, fiddles, accordians and all manor of horns are as much a part of their lives as eating and sleeping.Song and dance feature heavily in ""Black Cat, White Cat,"" Kustruica's finest and most complete film to date. The music isn't really a soundtrack, but is largely, physically written into each scene (performed with gusto by musicians who often follow the characters around). Indeed, the 'bad-guy' character of Dadan scarcely has a scene where he isn't swinging or dancing along to something (even a bizarre pop/rock song makes a comic cameo). But the other characters have their musical moments as well.""Black Cat, White Cat"" has a large cast and a sprawling storyline, largely resolving around two gangsters - Dadan and the hapless Marko - and their attempts to outwit each other. Things come to a head when Dadan tries to force Marko's son to marry his spinster sister as a repayment for one of his father's debts.But the plot is largely unimportant in a film of this type. The viewer is simply swept away in a good natured deluge of funny lines, inventive slap-stick, unusual settings and colourful supporting characters (a particular favourite: the old man who continually re-watches the last two minutes of ""Casablanca""). All you need to do is sit back and enjoy. Oh...and listen to the music."
"A return welcome for Emir Kusturica. His BLACK CAT, WHITE CAT is light entertainment, fun and uplifting. It's great to see all the ""old Gypsies"" back. They haven't aged much in 12 years. Maybe TIME OF THE GYPSIES, the English title of his darker classic on the subject, meant that the gypsies, and Kusturica's in particular, are TIME-less. Vibrant, and colorful, this master director's latest masterpiece turns cliche' into new fresh entertainment."
"With the chaos that engulfed the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, many people probably would have guessed that comedies could never come out of there. ""Crna macka, beli macor"" (called ""Black Cat, White Cat"" in English) would disprove that completely! After hustler Matko Destanov's (Bajram Severdzan) business fails, he agrees with gangster Dadan Karambolo (Srdan Todorovic) to marry his son off to Karambolo's daughter. But the two youngsters aren't quite ready to be married off just yet, and they'll do whatever they have to in order to fulfill their own wishes! ""Black Cat, White Cat"" is mainly interesting because we get to see a culture that we rarely see. Life in the Balkans doesn't look pretty, but this movie makes everything look funny. Emir Kusturica is truly one of a kind."
"This movie, like Underground, is so brilliant, so inventive, so full of ideas & images & imagination & feeling & humanity & humor that beside it American/Hollywood movies are like Campbell's chicken noodle soup, with too much water, all of them, no exception. Kusturica has to be the greatest living film director & the greatest director in at least 50 years. One would have to go back to Renoir & Rules of the Game to find a film with the energy & brilliance of Black Cat White Cat. Bravo, Kusturica. BRAVO!!!"
"I may not spend much time reviewing other movies but this one is worth writing a few words. It is one of the few movies in a decade that you can call genius work. The plot, the filming, the actors, the rhythm, the music, the melting of tenderness and bluntness all make justice to the words crazy, beauty and art. In some way, it reminds me of the sheer creativity of Amelie (Poulain). It is art, for the only pleasure of conveying beauty and emotions. And as much as Amelie should be seen in French, I can only recommend to see this movie in the original Gypsy language to fully enjoy the magic of this beautiful world, so strange and yet so real."
"Flawless example of higher quality cinematography schooling, inspiration and resources, Black Cat, White Cat is one of the most comprehensive descriptions of the gypsy communities along the lower Danube aswell as their differences in both nature and character. The Marquez like type of narration illustrated and photographed by the most talented crew and performers, the drama of the perpetual search for true love embodied in a gangster like conflict, spiced with refined humor and raw local language aphorisms brings both life and character to the sequel of the Time Of The Gypsies.  Much faster paced, this work of art leaves no time to contemplate  but urges the viewer to follow the stream like story line, bringing forward all the aspects of the society of the nomads. Influences from hindu, middle eastern, balkanic and latin cultures are absorbed into the sponge of the gypsy spirituality, one of the last ones to  reach fulfillment by just singing and dancing.Bravo Kusturica, another great work of art and thank all gypsies for all their deeds, right or wrong, still beautiful!"
"Kusturica is a unique director, one of the few wild and poetic one.
This movie represent very well the spirit of the Balkans. Every frame of this picture is beautiful, magic and surreal. You can see a enormous pig eating a car, a joyfull band playing music attach to a tree, a man washing is body with a white duck . . .And what about the music. It will cheer you up. A MUST SEE for everyone who love cinema."
"I saw UNDERGROUND and I have been very impressed, and one month ago I went to the movie theater in order to see BLACK CAT,      WHITE CAT and it was the illumination: ""What a great movie!"" I told myself. The music is very good, very captivating and structures all the movie. It make us discover a not very known culture: the tsigan culture which is very interesting and where music is very important.That movie stands out the RETURN of Emir Kusturica."
"Emir Kusturicas new film is a great example of good movie-entertainment. From the very first moment on it appears sympathetic to us. You see a man lying lazily in the sun, above him a hamster running in a wheel that drives a strange mechanical fan. In the background we hear some traditional Jugoslav music. A boat arrives with Russian goods and we see the little crook making a deal with the people on the ship. Of course everything goes wrong. Kusturica makes us love the strange environment and the strange people he presents us. The plot is complex as there are many people involved. Yet their patterns of behavior seem familiar to us; the jokes are mainly slapstick and the viewer can easily guess how the fairytale-like story will end. The director also puts very much thought into details, that eventually give the story the ""final touch"". One can sometimes compare his talent in this field to the great master Jacques Tati. There for example is a pig which is about to eat the inner parts of an old German ""Trabant""-car, every time we see it (about four times) the car is more wrecked. There are the two cats that are seen coupling next to two ice-cooled corpses in the attic of an old house. The big difference to other comedies using the same structures and methods is that Kusturica really loves his characters and shows that all their ""faults"" are part of their personality; the figures in this strange society are basically like you and me."
"This is a gangster film with lively, exaggerated characters, excentric men and resolute women, a weird plot and many visual gags. Kusturica shows the gypsies' life-style again in his last movie, with less depth and power than in Underground`, but with more ribald humour. Ugly and not too intelligent people (without exception!) chase and kill each other and their animals through a nice-looking landscape in the Balcans, listening to modern but also traditional gypsy music; loud, sometimes too loud, but original and in love with life. It's refreshing to see a convincing gangster movie without people in black suits and sun-glasses."
"Think about the Marx Brothers on LSD. Then double it. Then treble it. So what's the movie about? Well, there's this gypsy, a minor black marketeer, and his teenage son dealing with the cargo ships that drift down the river where they live. The father wants to hit it big - hijack a fleet of gasoline tankers. He needs a partner to set the whole deal up so he approaches a sex-crazed, gun-toting, fellow black marketeer who just happens to have an ugly, dwarflike sister whom nobody will marry. What's that? She doesn't want to get married? Okay, then tie her to a rope and throw her down the well until she agrees! A wicked double-cross takes place and the teenage son must marry the dwarf to save the father. But the son is in love with a homicidal waitress who's a crackshot with a rifle. And then there's the two dead grandfathers, on ice up in the attic so they won't disrupt the wedding. And then there's the band playing up in the tree. (Well, actually they're tied to the tree so they can't get away.) And then there's the wild escape and the tree running through the forest. (Yes, you did read that correctly.) And then there's the happy ending. Nobody walks in this movie! Everybody runs or jumps or dances. Lowlife characters. Absolute madness. Blacker than black comedy. Totally insane."
"A lot of people like to get into arguments and debates as to what the greatest film is...its hard to ever reach such a conclusion- if it is even possible- given that there are as many films as there are people, and it would be impossible to see them all. But then there are films that we watch and we know we have been changed forever. These are the films that we usually call our ""top 10"" or ""top 100"" and usually most of us will agree on specific titles, concluding that a particular film is truly a ""GREAT"" film.Black Cat White Cat is what I can call the Greatest film I have ever watched. It is of course quite a strong title to give a film, knowing such classics as Citizen Kane, The Godfather Part 1 and 2, I Am Cuba, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Seven Samurai or even Birth of a Nation have all at one time or another been given such a title by not just an individual...but by a panel of judges and critics from around the world. But there is something that this film has...a beauty, something absolutely magical and romantic...a fantasy that you only find in children's books, and yet it exists in this loud and clattered noisy film. How Emir Kustarica has done this is beyond my understanding. I first discovered Kustarica's films while living in England when one night I turned to ITV on a Thursday night and began watching The Time Of The Gypsies. I remember my mom really complained because it was 2am when the film started and we were going to Kent early the next morning but I told her I would go to sleep soon. Needless to say, the film was almost 3 hours long.. but it did prove to be a favorite of mine for a very long time...until I watched 2001 A Space Odyssey. So I battled in my mind...why do I enjoy these films more than the films others enjoy such as the Godfather? Why is my taste so different? I guess, different people enjoy different things, but we can all conclude a good smell, and evil and wicked mind...a soft breeze. What we cannot seem to agree on, is when a good film touches our hearts. The events that place in Black Cat White Cat are ridiculous and sometimes unreal. There is a scene where a band are playing while suspended on a tree...there is a dwarf girl whose single wish is to meet a tall dark handsome man, there is an arranged marriage, a dead grandfather...but what does it all mean or lead to? There are situations that are unbelievable and dreamlike, yet they are told in a very honest and sincere way that you believe them...unlike the films of David Lynch where you see something and its so mesmorizing you wonder.. ""is that even possible?"". This film however dazzles you with the thought of ""what you just saw is real..because you just saw it"". Its difficult to explain, but what you see in this film is a haunting, true, ridiculous and romantic situation that is beyond logic and yet so true to human nature. So is this my favorite film? I don't know. This film feels like part of my body. How am I supposed to say what is my favorite body part? How am I to choose my limbs over my heart? What I got out of this film is something I cannot even understand. I feel in love with film all over again. Maybe that was Mr. Kustarica's goal...to show us a romantic episode and hope it helps us reflect our own cluttered life. Or maybe he simply wanted to show a lifestyle of gypsies in Yugoslavia. I really don't mind not understanding the reason for his making this film because I like my confusion. I don't really care to know or not know, because I have concluded, that this is the greatest motion picture of our time."
"First warning. This movies *does not* reveal ""some deep mystery of life"", like you might expect from Kusturica. It's pure (and beautifully filmed) comedy that delivers what most other comedies promise.Second warning. This move does make ""politically uncorrect"" jokes, however it does not do it for the sake of attracting an audience that's proud of ""understanding"" and tolerating such jokes. Comparison with ""There's Something About Mary"" comes to my mind - with one huge difference: ""Crna macka, beli macor"" works! Anyway, this is not the major point of this movie.Third warning. Most of humor in this movie is situation comedy type. If you liked Oliver Hardy swallowing nails you will laugh to a fat lady pulling them out of wood with her buttock and vice versa. Two friends I saw this movie with were not amused at all!Besides the comedy part, it is a typical Kusturica movie. Geese running everywhere, special air-condition face cooling system type inventions etcetera. Everything you love. Plus one sparkling and one plain funny and sweet love story."
"if couldn't visit Yugoslavia in the mid 90s (or you just didn't want to: you aren't to blame, it was on war with the rest of the Balkans) watch this excellent movie which tells you about those people's life with more than a pinch of irony and original gypsy music. However, this isn't a gypsy or a gangster movie. It tells tales of those people who happened to live in such a curious country which almost became part of the Western World before a mad dictator made it slump back in the dark. All in all, one of the best movies I've ever seen and I highly recommend it to everyone who's eager read between the lines. It's really something different."
"Just two days ago, an evening ahead of an exam, I decided I was going to watch Black cat, white cat for the second time for it had been a long time since I had seen it.Now, even though I remembered large parts and particularly that I had found it a very good movie the first time even, the movie hit me even harder this second time now that I could afford the luxury to look at details with a closer eye.First off, visually it is one of the strongest movies I have ever seen. The camera-placing is very simple but brilliant for most parts you see the movie as if you were at the place yourself. As mentioned in other comments, the landscape provided gives an extra power to the already wonderful images.Next to visual beauty, any film who wants to outgrow the average has need of a soundtrack similar to the movie. In Black cat White cat, personally, I think that is the case. Not that I fancy gypsy music particularly, I think that is not even a requirement per se. This type of music was just a must to bring over the lifestyle of Balkan-people, and secondly, it adds a sort a speed that fits with the hyperactive events that take place.About the acting, there isn't much to say except for it is brilliant. Even the smaller roles don't make the movie fall out of place. This part you would have to make up for yourself, as to me views about acting performances are more subjective than about the storyline or the visual power.As to conclude, I would very much like to say that, if you call yourself an admirer of the better work of cinema, you got to have seen this movie.'I think it will be the beginning of beautiful friendship'"
"I must say this is the most refreshing film I have seen in a long, long time. Black Cat, White Cat has all the elements of a movie made in the Western world - violence, drugs, gangsters,  a robbery, drinking and sex but it is all handled so beautifully that none of it seems to be as harsh as what you would get out of Hollywood or London.The charm of the gypsy culture is their positive outlook on life and this shines through in Black Cat, White Cat - no matter how bad things get there is always time for a party. I won't go into detailing the story as I believe everyone should give this film a go without necessarily knowing what they're in for. The music is fantastic, the comedy crazy and the characters are all lovable in their own bizarre way. Overall a welcome break from the Tarantinoesque onslaught we've had over the last five years or so."
This is the best comedy I have seen in past 10 years. It is not only very funny but very stylistic and deep in content. This is about real life and real people in Eastern Europe. Certainly you will remember this movie for long time after watching it.
"The sublime goofiness of this movie is hard to describe; you really must see it for yourself. But some of its virtues are: it manages to be a classic farce, without ever seeming stylized; it showcases and celebrates the glorious music of the Rroma people in almost every frame, while keeping the convoluted narrative running; it presents even its densest, dopiest, kookiest and weirdest characters as full human beings, not stereotypes; and, not least, it presents a number of farm animals in juicy cameo roles (the car-eating pig ought to get some kind of ""Best Performance by a Barnyard Animal"" prize). The title characters, for example, appear in almost every crucial scene, and end up making the happy ending possible.Young lovers, lonely hearts, domineering grandparents, stupid con-artists, coke-head gangsters and flocks of geese make up the world of ""Black Cat, White Cat,"" always accompanied by torrents of music. If loony, generous, dark humor appeals to you, you'll love this wonderful, humane, totally delicious movie. Years later, this is still the best movie ever. You will just relish every minute of this crazy, out-of-this-world, humane and delicious masterpiece!"
"This movie is a mix of Marx Brothers, Jacques Tati, Monty Python-set in a world of gypsies and mobsters living on the Danube--with the Wrong Box, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and My Big Fat Balkan Wedding thrown in for good measure. Marko is a Groucho Marx-like figure whose schemes just shove him and his family deeper. Her turns to two gangsters, Mafia godfathers: one is a sick old man who wears a combination Star of David, Crescent and Cross around his neck, watched Casablanca over and over and gets around in a motorized wheelchair. The other is more flamboyant, has lots of gold chains and keeps his cocaine in a crucifix. This one cheats Marko and then demands that Marko's son Zara marry his only unmarried sister, Afrodita. But Zara is in love with blond and very modern gypsy. Unlike the Marx movies, the young love interest adds rather than detracts. Be warned: you'll read obscenities in the subtitles and see animals fornicating. There are bizarre juxtapositions of contemporary objects with ""primitive"" realities of the setting--and lots and lots of geese."
"I loved Chat noir, chat blanc. The story, the music, the cast and the cut are perfect. It tells the life of central European tsiganes: music, no-work life and magic. One of the best Kusturica's."
"This has got to be one of the most refreshing, off-beat movies I've seen in a long while. Welcome to Kusturica's world, and what a world... This film, apart from providing quite a few slap-stick laughs also delivers some visual jewels. The sunflower field scene with the two young lovers frolicking with joyful abandon is one of the most memorable ones and perhaps a simple summary of what I found this movie to be: One full of colours, energy, and a sense of happy carefree existence in a world where rules are only written as need be, all accompanied by an inebriating gypsy soundtrack."
Incredible...I just saw two films of Kusturica and he's already in my best filmers list. The film is something you have never seen before... a cultural movie from Yugoslavia!
"This was a movie that just washed over me. The amazing views of the Danube nearly distracted me from anything else, but the movie itself was really funny and a definite see-again."
"Kusterica has once again perfected another film in his typical unique style. Again he portrays simple stories in a not so simple country (Yugoslavia) and people ( the Rom) in the over-the-top style he has made his own. The story deals with the wedding of a young couple who are in love with others and the madness that goes around them and their criminal families to make sure the wedding goes through. The Gypsies, despite their eccentricities, are portrayed as the lovers of life that they are. Although many might be put off by Kusterica's style, those of Eastern Europe and especially the Balkans will recognize and embrace the craziness of the film."
"See it but not subtitled! You should speak Serbian (or Bulgarian) to have fun with this movies. It contains numerous actors but it is great - you have gangsters, hookers, losers (and winners), lovers, priests (sort of) and of course ... cats.The first time I saw this movie I remember I laughed so much I needed to go the WC several times!There is also a curious fact - one never finds out where exactly is the story developing. We know it is near the river Danube and it is a Gypsy village OR something but is it in Romania, Serbia ?!?Anyway, this is irrelevant, as it is a great Balkan movie by the best director that has ever lived in the Balkans."
"As all films that are deeply rooted in a territory, it is difficult to appreciate all it can deliver. For those like me that are not from the Balkans it is merely impossible to appreciate the perception of gypsies in those areas, how they live how they see life.Starting from this assumption that in a normal situation would undermine the perception of all viewers, i think that not only this film is hilarious, but is extremely creative and with an aestethics that is very peculiar. Faces, scenarios, plots and scenes deliver a combination of unique taste, colours, joy and vitality that have little in common with Western society. Virtually in every scene there is a domestic animal that is part of the frame and is there to deliver a sense of chaotic enthusiasm.The story itself is very simple, but it is delivered with extreme originality, with a compelling soundtrack and with some frames that are now part of the classic images of the cinema like the man hanged at the barrier with the umbrella and the band tied-up along the big trees.My favourite scene is at the end when Dadan Karambolo uses the white ducks to clean himself up from the filth. I wish I were able to generate ideas like this.I am not sure whether gypsies are a problem in the Balkans, but what the film delivers, although through a caricature, is a people full of creativity and that, at their way, can enjoy life better than a lot of us."
"I really love this film. I think that people from Europe ( from east ) can understand it a bit different than people from other countries. For me it's funny and humorous. The 'love scene' with the sunflowers is just beautiful! The whole atmosphere is well shown by the director -nowadays money are sometimes more important than anything (!). But the happy ending gives hope that there are some things which you can't buy - love, family and happiness. I admire Kusturica not because he's known as a good director and he should be admired! I just like he's way of making movies and showing the world. And the music is wonderful! I can watch 'Crna macka, beli macor' on and on, and I'm not bored. I think that 'it's a beginning of a beautiful friendship'. :)))"
"I watched this movie first time because a friend of mine recommended to me a year or so ago. I cannot believe how fast the two hours of the movie have passed, the story was crazy from the beginning until the very end. Right now, I have seen this movie twice and the second time the jokes seemed even funnier than the first time. I also recommended the movie to all my friends, none of them liked it except for one who really enjoyed the song ""Pitbull, Terrier"" which is completely hilarious and another one which happens to be a born Serbian. The conclusion is just sit and enjoy, don't expect anything logical or serious to happen, it's 100% crazy and funny."
"First film I've ever seen by director Emir Kusturica. My advice for this film is to sit back and have a good time. Don't think politics, just enjoy. If four letter words, mafia and the drug scene bother you, forget the movie or realize it's tongue in cheek. We can all stand a good laugh and some slapstick once in awhile. If you're an animal lover, you're bound to get your jollies. If you're a cat lover, the two cats in the title deserve special Animal Oscars. As for the ending, one of the best lines ever done in any film. You'll agree!"
"I didn't get much out of Emir Kusturica's film ""Underground"", and even less from this one. I'm at a loss to explain it's popularity, even among native Yugoslavians, as the characters in the film are not very appealing, in fact, they appear to work at being annoying. Scenes are disjointed and have almost a Keystone Kops kind of quality to them as if the characters, or at least the director, was on speed. The main villain character Dadan (Srdjan 'Zika' Todorovic) spends a lot of time mugging and making faces and doesn't strike one as being a serious gangster, if that's what he's supposed to be. I really can't imagine what anyone finds worthwhile in the story, and as things spiral to a close, Dadan finds himself immersed in a latrine full of crap. Welcome to the Johnny Knoxville/Jackass school of film making - European edition. At least there were a handful of one or two second scenes in which a black cat and white cat appeared to lend some credence to the title of the picture. Oh, and geese, plenty of geese. All white, none black."
"I only know of this film because it was on the memory of a 2nd hand mp4 player I bought today. I had a look on here before watching it and saw that a few people were complaining about the lack of plot and poorly developed characters. I can only assume they were either watching a different film or had been brought up on linear Hollywood pap. this is a brilliantly realised film with absurd but very real characters who have found themselves in an absurd but all too likely situation.the plot twists and turns and just when you think you've got a handle on it, it twists again and takes you on another tangent. no opportunity to make a joke is missed and all of them work, some are hilarious. show me another film that has a dwarf running away from a wedding in a tree stump or a man wiping sh*t from himself with a goose and I will buy your popcorn for a year. although this is ostensibly a gangster movie, it is never ugly or cynical and there is warmth and humour here and even a very touching love story, shot beautifully in the sunflowers. i loved every second of it."
"This is a perfect movie to watch if you are feeling blue and need some cheering up. Unlike most Kusturica's movies, this one is easy to watch, funny, and full of excellent comedy. You will enjoy this movie the most if you have no idea what you are in for. I was especially impressed by actors like Srdjan Todorovic and Branka Katic, who did the whole movie in the Romany language, and I am sure that neither one of them spoke a word of it before the movie. Very entartaining movie! All of the jokes are in their place, scenes are fantastic, use of animals amazing (I especially liked the pig eating old Trabant)."
"It's a great film, although not as relevant as Underground. Nonsense is present all around, making the film similar, in his own genre, to Fellini's and Jodorowsky's works. By means of his remarkable trait, Kusturika shows that music and particular moves and gestures are important keys to the comprehension of the world being pictured. As regards their rhythm, the scenes of the wedding are breath-taking and humorous at the same time."
"When this movie starts you feel like this is going to be an odd and ""laugh if you can"" movie, but as soon as a few scenes get into the movie the magic begins. It is up to a point amazing how the director is able to bring out of from the different scenarios and situations something that stirs you, make you laugh, keep you up or a combination. I find that the direction is superb. I could not believe at times how the actors of all types and categories were able to perform as they did. There was such a natural acting, it looked like if it were real, regardless of how odd the situation may have been. I find difficult to find things that could be perfected. I think that it reflects so much the mix of tradition and new technologies happening these days in many countries. The ability of the director to put together the high tech gadgets and the traditions, bringing them in contrast and full exposure."
"Cannes favorite Kusturica takes us back to his 1993 Time of the Gypsies with this machine-gun paced European hit that has enough insights for 5 different films. Generic story of two brothers' entanglement with mobster and younger sister is used as an excuse to show off impossible and absurd situations. The direction is near perfect (earned Kusturica prize at Venice) and the characters, constantly movin' to a techno beat, are not easily forgotten. I don't know where the director casts these people but a lot are Serbian non-actors."
"Beside, mafia lord falls in it, sniffs coke and shoots a machine-gun from the sun roof of his limo. All of it makes sense while being completely wacko. I pray mainstream film industry won't put-off other ways of making films. Look at what's at stake here."
"I can't get enough of this movie. It's simply genius. The fact that I live in an (almost) Balkanic country made me understand it better. It shows us the reality of a mixed-up community from Serbia, close to the Bulgarian border, on the Danube. I think it's pretty accurately illustrating the reality of the mid-end 90's in that part of the world, through its characters and action in a very hilarious way. Its soundtrack is very original and it's pointing to the heritage and location of the movie's characters and really sticks to your mind. The action is fast- paced, and the off-action gags(the two cats and mostly the pig eating the Trabant are very original and incredibly funny). It has really made my day and I recommend it to absolutely everyone."
"It's one of those films where just about every second provides something of entertainment, particularly something with a degree of light or dark humour. I laughed my head off when all those different things took place during the wedding, especially with the toilet-tumble later in the film; plus every time the focus switched to animal life, you could see a certain pig eating a Trabant!!!! That's a car with a body made almost entirely of cardboard, and a pig doesn't care what it eats. Just make it chewable.The Kusturica-Bregovic duo is spot-on for a person who has a taste of either films, music or both.10 out of 10. Magnificent."
"What can I say? Emir Kusturica is my favorite filmmaker ( Of course after my idol Abbas Kiarostami ) and he's made my No. 1 (UNDERGROUND) . this unique work of art recounts the story of Danube Gypsies in a remarkable, WACKY fashion .... Can anyone else in the world create such a story ... and the music is supremely one-of-a-kind like the film itself . it really demands multiple viewings."
"A truly feel-good movie.  A Balkan ""Only Fools and Horses on hallucinogenics.  You'll like it."
"There are elements of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' in this piece which are cleverly buried beneath the rollicking adventures of this small-time low-life society. Absolutely, these cats outdo the Shakespeare comedy.Everyone is out to use and abuse everybody else and we learn to accept that as Real Life as it was meant to be. The young lovers escape their slavery to family obligations to a happy ending and the shrew also finds true happiness in the least likely place. We get a morality play ending without feeling cheated in the least.There seem to be ethnic subtexts here which would be lost on a non-local audience - such as the Greek name of the local gangster family, the black comedy treatment of the murder of a corrupt guard on the border and the various religious or atheist affiliations. The sex urge seems to be everywhere as are cultural straight-jackets to keep it in check.My favourite scene is when the Matko character is given an enamel mug of the petrol that they've just bought for next to nix from a passing Russian barge with the object of assessing its quality by taste. He spits it out in disgust BECAUSE IT'S WATER! Priceless!"
It's only three weeks ago I heard about this movie. Last night I watched it for the first time on dvd and I think it's the funniest movie I ever saw in my (58 years old) life. I laughed for two hours and had tears of joy in my eyes! The music is wonderful too and an essential part of the story. It's impossible to compare this film with any other or to describe in short the totally insane story. I thought this a kind of East European Monty Python humor.
"Very few movies can delight me on this level. * * * Jeopardy contestant: ""Potpourri for a $1000, Alex.""Alex Trebek: ""Answer: A lounge singer pulling a nail out of a piece of wood with her sphincter, gypsy mobster melting with giddiness each time upon watching the ending to ""Casablanca"", two cats serving as witnesses at a wedding, a rat-powered fan, goose used as a towel, pig eating a car, telephone poles being watered, etc, etc.""Jeopardy contestant: ""What are the things that any movie can use more of?""Alex Trebek: ""Correct, for $1000."" * * *And, believe me, this is just the tip of the iceberg that's gonna hit you if you decide to watch ""Crna macka, beli macor"". An absolutely insane movie (in the best way possible) that for lower Danube does what Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn achieved for Mississippi introduces us to Gypsy communities in eastern Serbia near Bulgarian border. We first meet small-time oil smuggler Matko Destanov (Bajram Severdzan) and his 17-year-old son Zare (Florijan Ajdini). Their father and grandfather, respectively, Zarije (Zabit Memedov), also a former smuggler who paid his dues on the mean streets of Italy is a well off owner of the gravel separation plant but is currently in a hospital recovering from alcoholism. One day Matko gets a grand idea for a big score with the train shipment of petrol but lacks money to pull it off. Knowing old man Zarija is very unconvinced in his abilities Matko goes separately for money help to Grga Pitic (Sabri Sulejman) his dad's old buddy from Italian days and Dadan Karambolo (Srdjan Todorovic) an out of control gangster. Two of them however, have their own agendas so what on paper seemed like a straightforward deal quickly deteriorates into something unexpected.Kusturica, who always demonstrated a penchant for the absurd, outdoes even himself here by going to the extreme with a cinematic equivalent of the circus performance. The high wire act, bearded lady, elephants, tigers, cotton candy...it's all there on screen in one form or another and it's all fabulous."
An impressive movie with a lot of irony. It shows the passion of the director for his beautiful country and its people. It transponds the the flair from the screen directly into the audience...excellent & crazy
"I am a fan of Emir Kusturica's works. I like what he does and how he does it. His latest feature ""Chat noir, chat blanc"" is another masterpiece. Comedy of the extreme life of the Gypsies, magic realism all around. Colors everywhere, brilliant photography and an excellent way to tell a simple story. Emir began this film as a documentary for the lives of the Gypsy musicians he had in Underground and it ended as a marvellous film of the lives of the Gypsies. No-one else I think, can tell a story so good as Kusturica does. The most mainstream screenplay can easily transform it to sth magic. This film is a comedy about two 40-something guys fallen on their own miseries, four 20-something boys and girls falling in love, two 70-sth grandpas having fun (alcohol does work) and two cats, one black, one white. Kusturica compose all of the above elements to make a comedy about living, loving and taking the money. I would say that this specific film is more lovable than the other films (perhaps Underground as an exception) because it captures 100% the joy of living (who does that better than the Gypsies?). The soundtrack for one more time reaches sky high though not Bregovic. So, leave us alone and go see the film!"
"One of the best, funniest and strangest movies I've seen the last 3 Years! Wonderful authentic actors and crazy footnotes (e.g. the russian diva who is pulling a nail with her bottom out of a wooden pole). If you love the music of easteuropean gypsies this film is a must!"
"This is the best movie I ever seen ! The plans are fantastic, The actors wonderful, The music is perfectly integrated in the movie, The story is very fun.When I see this movie, I seem to be at a party.Gam"
"It is one of the best movies ever. This film shows, how deep Kusturica understands Gypsies!!! It is not like in Americans films where Americans are used to play Russians. It is very funny for me to watch such movies. They just don't understand Russia and their way of thinking and of course, vice versa, Russians don't understand Americans very well, although American culture is more exposed and it is easier to understand their culture.So i was very impressed by this film, but I also realized, that not everyone will appreciate this film. This film can show you if you can manage to live on Balkans. If you enjoy it, than you can come live here. If not, you will be constantly in depression and will be not happy. And I am not saying, that you have to get use to live in misery or something like that, you just have to have more different point of view and thinking. I don't think that only savages can enjoy it, I have master degree in Computer Science, I don't think I am stupid, but I still like this film very, very much. You just have to look beyond the first thing you see like violence, misery and so on.And I can say you which people will not like this film. This are people who think, that they life is the best and that everyone else must live like them. They just don't understand, that this is not true. If they see the different way of living, they start to think that those people are suffering, and that they must help them to live ""better"", to live like them, to have one house, two cars, social security and so on.So, I see in this film, how people can enjoy live even in a big misery and than and only than I can start enjoy this film."
"Goran Bregovic's music and dirrecting of Emir Kusturica are perfect solution for this movie. I was really surprised when i saw those two artist together on this project and i was verry satisfade.Movie can be direction for all movies from ex Yugoslavia, because it contains a lot of irony and humor, wich is verry symoblic for this part of Europe. Well life is not golden dream, but it can be verry happy if we take out materialistic things. And that Kusturica did in this movie. He showed to world that life can be fun, eventhose you don't have money.Only few movies from Usa can compare with this beautifull film.Well done Emir Kusturica! live long the king!"
"Although the characters are exaggerated in every possible way, the complete picture of this movie not only creates a distinct feeling of natural environment, but also allows us to smile for full two hours. The story speaks about father and his son, who are living near large river and trying to make money in every possible way. When another of dad's quick ideas falls through, the only way to clean up the mess is for son to marry the sister of local gangster. Although no one of the newlyweds want this wedding to happen it takes place, along with numerous humorous and thrilling events. Colourful landscape and people, fun atmosphere, excellent music, bright characters - all together create a movie that is full of lively and intelligent humor. Another masterpiece of Emir, this movie laughs about people and their weaknesses in very entertaining and positive way. Worth to see, definitely."
"Young and innocent Zare lived with his greed father. They lived happy life though they were poor. Zare liked the next-door girl Ida. To his surprise, Ida also liked him. But their happy time was short. The local unreasonable gangster chief Dadan forced Zare to marry his dwarf sister. Nobody dare disobey Dadan's orders because of his brutality. It was obvious that powerless Zare had to accept the imposed marriage.The unexpected ending really brought me a big surprise. What the movie revealed was just like happened in reality. Actors' performance was natural and satisfying. It is not just a comedy that makes you laugh. There were many things left you to think. Kindness is a virtue indeed.An excellent comedy. 8/10"
"Kusturica made another excellent movie. I was delighted after watching it. I would recommend it with all my heart, just as all other movies by Emir Kusturica.I hope  you will enjoy it!"
"This film is absolutely brilliant! The wonderful characters as well as the extremely colourful setting are simply perfect. The film is full of hilarious scenes, the wedding scene in particular is incredibly funny. ""This is the most beautiful day of your lives!"" ... and the couple looks as if they were about to be executed! Also, one of the wedding presents is from Emir Kusturica (I only noticed when I was watching the film with subtitles on.) Florijan Ajdini and Branka Katic make a wonderful team, Branka Katic is simply adorable throughout this film. Srdjan Todorovic plays an incredibly hilarious villain, but the two grandfathers are almost literally responsible for the film's 'magic'. This is definitively one of the most entertaining comedies I've ever had the pleasure to watch!"
"A very uncommon film, like Emir Kusturica love to do. More uncommon than Arizona Dream, but less than Underground. Music is like Underground, very enthusiastic and funny, it's take part of the movie environment. Story is not the most important things in this movie.In conclusion, a very good movie whith the typical Emir Kusturica style."
A GREAT film.There is so much going on at so many levels.  It seems at first to be a simple farce set in a gypsy village on the banks of the Danube in former Yugoslavia.  But it quickly deepens.  The antagonist - Dadan - is a monster cleverly hidden in the guise of a likeable rogue.  He may very easily be based on the real life war lord Arkan!Worth seeing many times.
"Not many people could manage to portray a day in the Balkans better then Kusturica. This movie will make you laugh and show in the same time a reality hidden from most people, even some that live in Eastern Europe. His style of directing is unique and if Underground was more of a drama, this is more of a comedy. Making things work even when they don't is a trademark for countries from the Eastern Block and making the impossible seem possible and succiding is this movie's trademark. In a high tech world, where so many of the old values have been forgotten, Kusturica manages to find the one spot where tradition and cultural values still mean something and are in conflict with everything that come new. I guess that it's a comedy in the end, that shows best and with irony how people survive in difficult conditions and how they struggle to keep their cultural values intact."
"An hour and a half of Bulgarian craziness on the Danube.  A little hard to follow at the start, but as the characters of this extended family start to come into focus, the plotting and scheming (for love and money, of course) all falls into place.  Great sight gags and unorganized mayhem.  Be sure to watch for the rat powered fan."
"I must say, I don't understand why so many believe this movie is brilliant and praise Kusturica so much. The movie doesn't even make sense most of the time. The story line is confusing and the characters are very similar to each other which makes it even more difficult to keep up with. There are some funny and well thought episodes, but all in all it is not a good movie I have to say. You kind of wait for something to happen that makes sense and binds the movie together but it never seems to appear, which is kind of annoying when watching a movie.I wonder if people tried to abstract from the fact that it is a movie by Kusturica, would they still think it was a brilliant movie? I doubt it. I have no knowledge of Kusturica or the Balkans which is maybe why I didn't understand all the cultural and humorous attended scenes but that shouldn't really be a criteria for a movie in order to watch it."
"I just so happened to find this movie on cable Christmas day. I started to watch it and then went to something else, but came back to it. What a great and funny movie. I watched it all the way through. This movie was all over the place. The characters, the plot, the music. It was just a lot of fun to watch and enjoy. Please don't look for a block buster here. This is the type of movie to watch and enjoy with some chips and dip or some other type of food and just watch to be watching.Trust me, you will not be disappointed at all.The wedding scene was particularly funny - right up until the end of the movie.I want to see this movie from the beginning, because I turned it on in the middle."
"how could i give less than 10 to a movie which catched me from beginning to happy end without a single spared spot? i laughed 'til the tears... but my mark isn't just at the movie itself than more over at the exuberant taste this guy has to show you what life is:a wonderful drama! BRAVO! actors seem to be born only for this,i don't know if he finds out them among real actors in which case:congratulations. scenery is so essential and photography shines of a proper life. i don't know much about the soundtrack but i think that the guy provides himself as ever. then,if Kusturica is a visionary,let's have more dreams from him! for having this comment sent i've to fill up a minimum of ten lines.this would change the essence of the word ""comment"".anyway here you have!"
"OK, I'm a Serbian and many of my fellow countrymen do NOT like this film, and we're wondering how on Earth is possible that everyone out of our country loved it and why it has such following. The answer could be this: people from rest of the Europe like to watch ""crazy"" Balkan lifestyle and stupid grimaces that the characters in this movie make. Besides this, I think Kusturica's early movies, which were great, made him creditable to make stupidities he really likes (this one and every later movie). Balkan is really unique corner of the world, but the humour used in Kusturica's movie hardly aims for intelligent people. But the main damage that ""Black cat"" did to Serbian cinema is overshadowing some really good pieces of cinematography that were made in this country: Special Education, Reflections, National Class, Who's Singing Over There?, Tito and Me, The Ballad of a Cruel One, The Balkan Spy, It Happened on This Very Day, Backbone, The Promising Boy, Magic Sword, Marathon Family, The Fall of Rock'n'Roll, Oktoberfest, There Are No Small Gods, Taiwan Canasta, and many others you've never heard of."
"A story about drug dealers and the life of gypsies in Yugoslavia could be a simple diagram of this Kusturitsa film. Poverty,the mediterranean way of life and the will to obtain power are essential factors in creating a vivid comedy. A girl is lowered in a well because she does not want to marry what they have chosen for her.Great sceneries,continuous jokes,violent pictures and a mosaic of quick happenings. Music plays an important role.The girl that runs in the sunflower field with her friend reminds the spectator of the western culture.Unique yugoslavian environment with the ever-changing climate of human conflicts.Love,agony and search for wealth in a stylish landscape of social fight."
"And here's to another cinematic jewel from the 'Emir' of Eastern European cinema: Mister Kusturica... ... or should I say 'Master' because if it wasn't for his deliberate marginality and peculiar uniqueness, Kusturica would be mentioned as 'one of the greatest' of his generation... but like other maverick visionaries such as Mel Gibson or Spike Lee, his genius is discredited by pompous intellectuals, who'd drink any Spielbergian soup instead of tasting one glass of Kusturica's nectars.This is not just anecdotal: politics came close to shortcut his career. After the Golden Palm winning of ""Underground"", notorious French intellectuals criticized the movie for taking a pro-Serbian side in the conflict and the height of infamy is that one didn't even watch the movie, I won't pollute this review by giving names but Kusturica took offense and swore to never make movies again. His legacy would have been all the more respectable but what a waste if he hadn't retracted himself. Wishing to make a music-related documentary about a band named Musika Akrobatica, his ceativy caught up with him so he decided to make the music a skeleton and add some flesh through the story. Personally, I feel like all his movies were made along the same pattern and ""Cats"" feels like a more screwball and homely version of ""Underground"". Saying it's a lesser film shouldn't even diminish its value, the same year, the Coen brothers came with ""The Big Lebowski"", which was the perfect oddity after their masterpiece ""Fargo"". Every genius is entitled to loosen up sometimes.1998 was also the year of other crime-related twisted comedies: ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and all these films took the lion-share of popularity while ""Cat"" should be standing on the same podium. The film is an eccentric romance, a gangster picture full of deceptions and double-crossings, and a musical that ventures in the realm of Kusturica's Fellinian penchant for lust and ""joie de vivre"". It might be inhabited by crooks, dirty, manipulative people but people with such a lust for life that we secretly envy even the ugliest or most miserable of them.And what ""Cat"" also does with majestic brio is to embrace the Gypsy culture and the remains of a Yugoslavia destroyed after years of a brotherly conflict. ""Underground"" ended on that bleak and sad note of a country that existed no more yet was still living through the memories and the hopes of a generation that hasn't lost its spirit, that same party that concluded the film with a disclaimer saying ""This story has no end..."" Kusturica was optimistic after all.And rightfully so as the phoenix to resurrect from the ashes was apparently nesting in a Roma camp, full of violin and trombone players, sixties' cars turned into carts, cards players, smugglers, beggars, matchmakers and even a woman who can get a nail off a plank with her bosom, all in music of course. People would find any excuse to have fun and enjoy life, corruption is never too far... but c'est la vie! That's life.As for death, while the Yugoslavian conflict was one of the deadliest conflicts of European history, death here is handled as a mere inconvenience, even as a joke, that's how cathartic the film is beneath its 'comedic' surface. It also contains one of the most surreal gags I've ever seen, just pay close attention to the poster, a dead fat man is hanging on a barrier holding an umbrella and a bag full of money a frail Roma man is trying to get. Maybe it's a metaphor for the film's morale: sometimes, money can be hanging on a thread just right your nose and you can't reach it, maybe it's a metaphor for love as something so close yet so far. Or maybe it's telling us that dead people can still be pain in the asses and as much burdens as the living... especially when later, a woman is forced to marry a guy she doesn't love and that he doesn't love because of a promise made to dead people. Or maybe it's just a great sight gag. You can never tell with Kusturica, his movies are so rich on an intellectual and emotional level, that you're afraid to lose your grip on the fun by being too analytical, and when you're caught in the flow of people singing and dancing whether to gypsy standards or pop music (that ""Where Do You Go"" was so 1990's) you're like ""did I miss something?"".Like a sweet acid trip, ""Cat"" is full of odd and weird imagery involving flying geese and a pig eating a car, it also works on many contrasts: the two cats, a giant man and a dwarf woman who can't find the true love, two old friends one rich and another poor and an unscrupulous bastard you end up loving anyway: Srdjan 'Zika' Todorovic who was Blaki's naïve son in ""Underground"" doesn't just steal money, he steals the show as Dadan the fun-loving and drug-snorting gangster.Speaking of the cast, I was glad to see the good old grandmother from ""Time of the Gypsies"", playing the same role and not having aged a bit ten years after. Yes, there's always this family feeling with Kusturica and when the actor who played Marko in ""Underground"" made his cameo, I knew the cake got its cherry. When he won his first prize, a critic said ""the winner is nobody from nowhere"", funny how from today's perspective, this sounds almost as a compliment. Kusturica has a way to turn any critic into a driving force, so maybe it's not such a bad thing that he was so vehemently attacked if it encouraged him to have fun in the most careless, shameless and still harmless way, especially since comedy is a familiar territory.And unlike ""Underground"", this story had an end, and such a happy end it was written on the credits."
"Emir Kusturica's Black Cat, White Cat is a celebration of freedom and joy. Story is set in Yugoslavia around a few eccentric characters in a strange scenario. It is a feel-good comedy which doesn't rely on situations. Every character is painted with different color and each follows its journey in order to fulfill their dreams. When their paths get crossed, what we have is series of pleasant comedic encounters. The film is full of beautiful moments as a result of Kusturica's genuine imagination. Sometimes even the animals play a major part. Apart from that screenplay, editing, soundtrack, references are amazing and the assemble turns out to be the grand entertainment.It is a colorful feel-good movie capable of lightening the mood of any person."
"It was a weird comedy, one of those rare kind. You won't like it from its very beginning. It took me for nearly 30 minutes to understand the characters and storyline. After that it was non stop adventurous fun ride especially wedding ceremony scenes were extremely amusing. Each character was funny and very unique which made the movie very special. I liked the total scenario, I mean the culture and all as in a movie which generated laughs in us.It was a beautiful romance tale with a backdrop of gangster theme. Actually there were two gangsters in the story, where a father and a son and his love lady are stuck and struggle in between them. When a new business fails, the father is in the position with one option left to solve where his son must take the hand of the sister of money lender. In other hand the son is in love with another girl. The money lender's sister is also forced to do so yet to find her perfect man. When all these characters meet at once in the wedding ceremony, the twist and turn in the story occur and who are all getting benefit of it is the remaining.It is unbelievable that I almost gave a high rating to this movie. You know I was not in favour of it when I began to watch after the so average opening sequences. While progressing the story it emerged as a finest comedy, in fact one of the finest comedy ever produced. For every scene after a scene it began to surprise me in every possible way. It was only moving harder and deeper reaching the core of the audience's laughing sense to tickle. I might be overwhelmed, it may not bring LOL at you because it was a dark humorous flick so definitely it will bring a large smile on your face throughout.There was a fat pig often showed in the movie which was eating some old car's skin. I don't know what it's for and where it fits in the story but it was very much enjoyable for the moment. Like that there were many huge humorous scenes it had. Musics and dances were another advantage of the movie. For the last 90 minutes I almost forgot myself. I have been among those characters and enjoyed every second of my stay. I can highly recommend it to you but I don't know whether it is your kind stuff. Certainly I assure majority of you would love the movie and you may consider one of your all time favourite comedy ever."
"A confusing and dizzying collection of stories that leaves you wondering: should I leave the theater or should I stay?I chose to stay despite the movie.  The plot had no focus at all and it seemed like a collection of half-baked ideas and Animal-House style pranks and gags.  Did Kusturica really expect us to care about characters that are the Yugoslavian equivalent of American white trash?  I'm being kind, the characters were obscene caricatures, thoroughly unappealing.  I enjoy a good farce like the next guy, but this was B-A-D and not in a good way.Call me uncultured, but I don't care about movies whose only merit is that it comes from a different culture.  Give me a reason to like your movie, Mr. Kusturica."
"This was recommended by a friend, as the best film she knows. This is an intelligent woman, so I endured some frustrating months trying to find it in the US, finally to see it on an overseas trip.It wasn't a great experience for me, excepting two elements. My guess is that I am not from the south of European as my friend is. The stereotypes that are exploited here are simply unknown to me, and all the humor depends on exploiting the twinge that real stereotypes elicit. Also, as an American, I get no reward from the knowledge that this is genuinely human from a region that was at the time deep in the most depraved state genocide. The distance between civilization and barbarity in this area of Europe was little more than the distance I often drive to visit a movie theater.Lacking that, what I get is zaniness unconnected to my sense of self and dread. So the zaniness taken out its situation has to stand on its own. It doesn't for me, because it is not handled as a cinematic value, rather just a color, a tone. If you have not seen this, it is a sort of ""Cannery Row"" based on the foibles of Balkan Gypsies: twisted families, peculiar macho drives, love theft and lies.There are two very lovely things here. One is the liquid environment. The locations and how they are handled is extremely cinematic. Everything is in motion: gaggles of birds, other animals, boats on the river, an old gangster in a raggedy vehicle and of course the troop and camera. The fluidity of this is far more valuable than the humor, at least for me.The other lovely thing is a seduction scene that may be one of the most engaging in cinema. A quirky young woman has her eye on a young man. Like all men in this world, he is a nitwit, but is young and clean. She leads him to a field of sunflowers, where she romps while stripping and enticing by running away. Her teasing giggle is profoundly attractive, and I suppose that this one scene must have percolated for a long time. (In all later scenes, the quirkiness of the girl is gone, and she plays simply a love interest.)Oddly, the cats of the title are the clumsiest and least integrated bit.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"One must not need to don a sociologist's hat to understand the funny ways,bizarre manners and traditional behavioral patterns of Balkan gypsy people. As they are true to life they form everlasting bonds with the most common of people.According to Kusturica,an essential lesson that can be learned from his film is that for Gypsies the honor of the family is sacrosanct and ethical codes have to be followed. Black cat,White cat is a powerful example of a film with huge doses of black humor.It is true that love or methods of getting love remain some of the basic premises of this film but it shows more than that. It shows a grim state of affairs which the Balkan nations experiences after their break up.A word about this film's laughing tactics.It is a joyful laughing riot based on daily life's absurdities. It is not a humor resulting from the cruel depiction of a person falling as a result of having put his feet on a banana peel.Mention must be made of its soundtrack which has been done by a team of three people."
"Not the Director's best, in terms of gravitas, but it is not supposed to be. (refer Time of the Gypsies, Underground et al) It's a rollicking farce cutting swathes through celluloid in his own inimitable style and flare. The visuals are outstanding, direction masterful, acting great, soundtrack superb. It is a true cinematic artist letting rip like a child in a candy shop. The closest we have ever got to Fellini again, although Kustirica is clearly his own man. The Coen brothers are perhaps one of his few contemporaries.With this film he returns to his one true love: the gypsies of the Balkans, Serbia to be precise, and portrays that culture through his own romantic, humanistic, and gloriously grotesque imagination. It also encapsulates the essence of Balkan humour, evident throughout his films and also to be found in the Vox Pops 'Sarajevo diaries' made by real people trapped in Sarajevo when it was under siege during the war: irreverent, slapstick, poetic, ironic, erotic and more than anything full of the vitality of life -traits he finds most concentrated in gypsy culture."
"Kusturica does a superb job in this comedy mafia-humor-movie. The Directing is really well done. The plot goes very well with the characters, scenery and humor. It has some real mature humor and Kusturica manages it very well. There isn't just one miscast in this great film, Bajram Severdzan as the lead role is just magnificent. This is a totally unique movie with unique characters, that any comedy fan should not miss. It seems that everything is out of place, like not staged or something. It's a total different look at the mafia that we are used to see. The first work from kusturica i'd seen was Arizona Dream and I was thinking to give another one a shot, it turned out even better than that wonderful movie. You wont be disappointed."
"Emir Kusturica's 'Black Cat, White Cat' can be described as Serbian 'Snatch' with the perfect dosage of nasty and dark slapstick. It is quite hard to find the correct words to describe this absurdist fable about rivalry, doublecross, and love. Yet the grotesque humor doesn't take away any sweetness from the love story arch, and all the characters stay sympathetic till the end together with all their quirks. Mesmerizing piece of surreal cinema.If there is one Emir Kusturica movie you have to see, then it is 'Black Cat, White Cat'."
This was only the second time I watched a Kusturica film - and yet I cannot imagine a world without his movies! It's like finding the answer to an important question. Filled with such warmth and love of life! Great acting and writing.
