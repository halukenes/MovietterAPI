"There are four scenes that I will treasure forever:1) The ferry ride, and the subtle ways you can tell they're both heartbroken, lonely, frustrated and angry. The way she discusses the ""little details"" that compose a person, and what she missed most in him. ""Like I remember the way your beard has a bit of red it in, and how the sun was making it glow that...that morning right before you left.""2) The scene in the van, where they finally unburden themselves. One of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays I've seen on celluloid. The way she reaches out to touch him, but holds back at the last second. Much different in tone from the way Hawke reached out to brush her hair aside in the first film.3) Celine's song. So simple yet so endearing. The way her voice fades to a whisper as she sings, ""My heart will be yours until I die.""4) The ending, which is in all ways **PERFECT**. The slow fade, the utter charm of her Nina Simone impression, the ambiguity, and the wonderful look in his eyes as his youth, hope and happiness come rushing back to him while watching Celine dancing and singing (foreshadowed in the opening scene). This is, perhaps, one of the ten best endings in the cinema.Hawke and Delpy are sublime, of course. This film requires incredibly subtle acting, and these are Oscar worthy performances that will not be recognized because they are not showy. Much of this film, like life, is acted with the eyes. Witness how Hawke stares at Delpy as she discusses her failed relationships on the ferry, or the sadness and longing in Delpy's eyes as she sings her love song. As in the first film, the chemistry between them is indelible. My candidate for best on-screen couple ever.This film is better than the first, because it provides a more unique perspective. In Sunset, we see the sobering effects of age and disappointment etched in their faces and clouding their lives. There is more at stake here, for they are nine years older, have made their share of mistakes, feel imprisoned by responsibilities, and must confront their shortcomings and problems. It's comforting to believe that hope and love will prevail in their case."
"...is that it ends. This is a fantastic film. It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked 'Before Sunrise' as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says ""nothing that is complete breathes"", and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.The dialogue is amazing, the acting is spot-on; this is a great film. In some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie, in that I really felt like I knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end. Kind of like saying goodbye to an old friend. If you are an action movie kind of person, skip this flick because it will bore you to tears. If, on the other hand, you like good dialogue, well formed characters, and aren't quite jaded enough to have given up completely on the idea of true love, don't miss this film."
"I'd been longing to see this one as I'd always thought 'Before Sunrise' was one of the most honest, most real films I'd ever seen, but at the same time I held off seeing the sequel from fear of disappointment. For all of you in the same position, fear not ; Linklater, Hawke and Delphy (for it has surely been a joint effort and labour of love for all three) have done us and themselves proud. I've just seen the film and despite being male and 38 I feel like Roberta Flack must have felt when she penned 'Killing me Softly' after hearing Don McLean sing 'Vincent' in concert; this is - once again - just so close to what it's all about. You want technicalities? The acting, superb; Hawke and Delphy slip right back into their characters, their mannerisms, their sometimes gauche repartee, the way they seem to fence around each other, seeming to go in for the kill then feigning, drawing backExquisite. And then the details, the echoes of the first film in the settings but now with a world-weariness, an autumnal note and yet with still that fundamental freshness and optimism that revives the memories of Sunrise's youthfulness and reminds us, as our heroes discuss, that though time changes people, there remains an unchanging core. Just see it; this is about as good as it gets, folks."
"Before Sunset is one of those movies, you either love, or you hate.Personally, I loved it.Now, I recommend watching ""Before Sunrise"" first, however it isn't necessary. Before Sunset does a good job of reviewing what had happened, therefore if you decide to watch it Before watching ""Sunrise"" you have nothing to worry about.Some scenes are extremely well done. The characters are picture perfect, and the movie itself, is breathtaking. The aura of the movie is so spectacular, that it will inspire young directors out there, to pick up their video cameras are start filming.An 80 minute movie, about two lovable characters and what they have to say, may sound boring. But the way it's done in Before Sunset, will sweep this impression right off your feet. Julie and Ethan play two of the most honest and true characters I have ever seen, they are known as Jesse and Celine. And while much of the credit must go to the characters themselves, you musn't forget the actor and actress who played them.Julie is perfect as Celine. The young french actress is so natural in front of the camera. Definitely, has potential. Ethan is also very very honest, he seems so comfortable character that that you forget your watching a movie, and not a home-made video.Both play with such honest expression, and such trueness, that they are so natural, Before Sunset becomes no longer a movie. It feels as if you are eavesdropping on two extremely developed people. It's such an intimate environment, that you never want to leave.Before Sunset... 9.901/10*****"
"I suspect that Before Sunset is getting such mixed reviews because it will mean very little to viewers who have not reached the stage of life portrayed in it. To my mind, this is not a romance. Rather, it's a very frank look at how we end up with life partners.For that reason, it is an important film for twentysomethings to see and is a gift to them from Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy. SPOILERS FOLLOW: The death of Celine's grandmother brings up two issues: the role of chance and that of our responsibilities to ourselves. Jesse knows Celine missed their planned meeting in Vienna because her grandmother died. But this does not prevent his pained question on the boat, something to the effect of 'Why weren't you there?' He is referring to rotten luck, the dark side of fate that is capable of robbing us of what we most desire. What were the odds that her grandmother would have died within those few days? Tiny. But it led to them not meeting again.However, Celine still chose to not meet Jesse. Yes, her family may not have understood had she skipped the funeral. But life is for the living, and her grandmother wouldn't have known if she hadn't been there. So Celine must take responsibility for the fact that their lives didn't include each other.Another precious dialog occurs when they discuss why they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers nine years ago. Celine says it was because they were young and overly optimistic and assumed they'd meet plenty of people with whom they would connect equally well. Are the twentysomethings listening?Celine expresses a problem many face when she explains why she prefers to have a boyfriend who is away much of the time: she feels suffocated when he is around too long. But she has been depressed since reading Jesse's book because she misses the kind of total intimacy they briefly shared and realizes there is no easy solution to this dilemma. One cannot simultaneously be intimate and distant, and all relationships involve finding a compromise.Jesse's marriage is an ordinary one. He married his wife because she was smart, pretty, and pregnant, and marriage is about commitment. But even on his way to the church he was thinking of Celine. Are we being warned of the danger of staying in a mediocre relationship? He says his wife and he are now like coworkers in a preschool, a description that will ring true with many viewers. So is the lesson that you should throw caution to the wind and sacrifice all for someone who thrills your heart for a day? Before Sunset offers no such easy solution, as Jesse and Celine admit they may have discovered they didn't like each other after all. As I see it, the primary role of film is to give voice to emotions and aspects of life we all know to be true but are not acceptable to discuss in polite society. In this regard Before Sunset excels. I can't help but think that when Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy decided to do this brief film it was not about profit at all-they simply had some things they thought people should hear, and this was their gift to the public."
"""Before Sunrise"" was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90's. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn't know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary, but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn't stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.Here it is now, the most unlikely sequel I have ever seen, ""Before Sunset"" - made not for money but for pure artistic purpose only. Much of the magic of part one could have been destroyed, but somehow Linklater and his two main actors managed to pull it off. ""Before Sunset"" takes place nine years after Jesse and Celine first met and as soon as the movie starts you feel like you meet old friends you haven't seen in a long time. You know these people and immediately feel at home with them. I was afraid that ""Before Sunset"" might give answers to questions that shouldn't be answered in the first place. If ""Before Sunrise"" was a dream that two young people had, then this movie could only be the rude awakening, the confrontation with reality. And somehow it is just that. It's a bit disillusioning to hear that all did not turn out as well as one might have imagined. We learn that Jesse and Celine are not particularly happy in their lives and that they are not really the romantic persons they used to be nine years ago. The soothing thing to see, however, is that they are still here. They both have passed their 30th birthday, they have jobs and their future is more or less decided, but they're still longing for passion in their lives and as soon as they meet each other, it's there again. They might have given up a lot of their dreams and beliefs but one thing remains true: their feelings for each other. While they're talking it's like they turn back time and become the young, hopeful people they once were again. I'm getting a bit carried away, but that's the beauty of these two movies, ""Sunrise"" and ""Sunset"". The story sucks you in and you're not able to stop thinking about it for a long while.Another thing ""Before Sunset"" did, it made me reflect on my own life. How have I changed in the past nine years? What has become of my dreams? Obviously, I have gotten more cynical, because at times I was irritated by Celine's talk about environmental problems and her emotional outbursts. It took me way longer than last time to ""bond"" with her character this time around.Anyway, the performances by Hawke and Delpy are wonderful once again. Their acting is as natural as can be, and thinking of Hawke's recent divorce in real life you wonder how much of his character in the movie is based on his own personal experiences.Unfortunately, the movie is over way too soon. After about an hour you have already arrived at the final scene - a scene that is just amazing. It makes you hope that somehow everything will work out for Jesse and Celine and that maybe they will stay together this time. As part one, ""Before Sunset"" doesn't have a definite ending, though.It's sure nice to see that apparently Linklater cares about Jesse and Celine as much as I do and made such a good sequel. He could probably even make a third part. ""Before Sunset"" has convinced me that it could work."
"I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film. While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood, I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments. It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element. It needed something more. At the time I couldn't put my finger on it, but after seeing Before Sunset, I could see what it was. Maturity. This may sound strange, but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film. They lacked connectiveness to the average person. I couldn't see myself in this situation. Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago, it would have been closer, but I just couldn't capture the moment. In Before Sunset, I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.They seemed to have grown and experienced a life that was all their own. They seemed more passionate, more powerful, and especially more human. From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celine's apartment, I was fully immersed in their conversation. I wanted to know everything I could about both of them, and I did. I loved hearing about Celine's passion for the environment, and Jesse's distraught marriage. It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives. Whether it was a scripted story or if Hawke and Delpy were playing off each other, it worked. I witnessed in this film two people who were made for each other. It was more obvious in this film than in the prior outing. What made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors. They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community. This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years. His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him, yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine. His pushy sexual advances seemed less forced and instead more like honest love. He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life, and it finally happened. You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again. It was more than just acting, he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see. The same goes for Delpy. At the beginning of this film, I didn't like her character. She seemed rough and rigid around the edges, constantly giving off that feeling that she was harboring a secret that she didn't want Hawke to know. As her character grew in this film, I understood why. She had a different life after the encounter than Hawke did. While he still longed for Celine in his heart, he did move on. She longed for Jesse in her heart, and to this day could not find anyone to replace his purity. I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing. Did she remember their night together? Did she really loose her grandmother, or did she just not show up that day in Vienna? Was the song just for Jesse? So many questions left me wanting more and more and more. Finally, I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films, and this was a crowning achievement for him. He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original. He continued with a similar format as the first, but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city. The language in this film is intense. Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie, they embody so much of our culture and our lives. There were moments when I felt they were speaking thoughts directly from my mind. Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility. Overall, this was a brilliant film. Linklater captured the essence of these two heart-struck people and proved that it could be filmed. This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over. The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie. This was a huge step up from the original, and is one of the best films of the year. If you were not a fan of the Before Sunset, I suggest that you check this out. It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could. I would not be surprised if we saw the title of this film in the Oscar celebration this year. Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives, fall in love, and especially to see the beauty of Paris. Grade: ***** out of *****"
"I had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.In many ways, this reminded me very much of one of my most favorite movies of all time, ""My Dinner with André,"" in which just 2 characters talking comprised the whole movie. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner at which they caught up with what the other had been doing. The two principals, André Gregory and Wallace Shawn, played themselves and each represented one side of a dialectic, say the side of romanticism vs. a conventional reality. ""Before Sunset"" is parallel in many ways.At one level we have a romantic story -- two people who'd briefly been lovers nine years before and lost touch meet again. They spend an afternoon together. Will they try to fulfill what they'd started? At another level, we have the charm of conversation and exploration, of reminiscing, of gradually feeling out and discovery of how much do I have in common with this person now? -- where has this person been? -- what are they capable of now? -- how much freedom of choice do I have, does this other person have -- to make decisions? Etc.While Celine and Jesse have a capacity for relating and talking, they also have somewhat opposite ways of viewing the world and relationships -- Celine is more cynical and reserved; Jesse is more open to settling for the ""not-perfect-but-good-enough.""There are possibly a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship in which one wonders, ""what would have happened if I'd pursued that relation?"" but probably most people have. And the other dilemma, of meeting again that someone but by now being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my present life. What would it do to them if I were to pursue my own happiness at the expense of them? Can I do that? Can I value the chance of my own happiness above theirs? Etc.The film, fortunately, gives us no answers to these essential questions but it does pose them in a way that makes us consider them.Delpy and Hawke are given screenwriter credits and I feel sure that they must've contributed a great deal to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.GREAT movie. No movie satisfies everyone, of course, but at the time I wrote this, slightly over 50% of the voters gave it a 10/10. For those of us in that group, it's a great film."
"""Before Sunset"" is one of those movies that look superficial, romantic, weepy, crowd-pleasing, but really is original, smart, analytical, and challenging. It stands by itself but is richer seen in relation to ""Before Sunrise,"" made nine years earlier, of which it is the sequel, and besides that it's richer and subtler than the original. The characters and the actors are older, more experienced and more sophisticated. It's got a documentary element, reminiscent of Michael Apted's wonderful ""7 Up,"" ""14 Up,"" series. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, who also stared in ""Before Sunrise,"" don't have to pretend to be nine years older in this sequel; they are. They're only thirty-three now, but Hawke has the ravaged gauntness his breakup with Uma Thurman seems to have imposed on him. Delpy is more mature, less angelic, more businesslike, but still beautiful. ""Before Sunset"" is a leaner film than ""Before Sunrise."" It's real-time, and without frills. Venues or backgrounds are simpler. Jesse and Céline largely just walk and talk. Hawke and Delpy are more accomplished actors; less self-conscious people. The talk flows more effortlessly. The continuity of the scenes is a seamless tour de fource almost as if this were all a single take like Sokorov's ""Russian Ark."" There isn't flirting or a developing attraction, a growing physical intimacy, as in ""Before Sunset,"" because Jesse and Céline spend most of the film talking about that earlier meeting and how it has haunted them and dominated their lives. Gradually it comes out (particularly during the car ride that leads to where Céline lives) that her current relationship is limited and his marriage is largely sexless, redeemed only by his adoration of his four-year-old son. She pretends not to remember that they made love that night in Vienna nine years before. Maybe that means their sudden passion never really was consummated, because their affinity wasn't something one night's sex could fulfill. The premise is this: Jesse has published a novel that's a bestseller in the US and he's doing a signing in Paris. (Hawke's real life identity fits here, since he's published several books.) Suddenly as he's coming to the end of his talk, Céline appears outside the window of the bookstore (which is one every American in Paris knows: Shakespeare & Company). He's supposed to go to the airport in a couple of hours, but his bags are packed and a car is ready, and he and Céline agree to go and talk. She leads him to a café called Le Pure. (This is real time, but not real space: the places where they go are far apart.) Then they take a boat ride on the Seine; finally they get in the car and wind up at Céline's apartment which turns out to be a lovely enclave where her neighbors are together outside having a party.A movie in real time consisting mostly of conversation is impossible to summarize: it would take twenty pages. But it does emerge that both still think about each other a lot; that meeting nine years before has remained important. The flame still burns bright. Jesse did go back to Vienna six months later in the station to meet Céline as they'd promised, but her grandmother was buried on that day and she couldn't be there. Later he says that perhaps his dream of romantic love was shattered forever by her failure to appear. They rue the fact that they didn't exchange addresses or phone numbers. There's little touching or kissing but there doesn't have to be. It's obvious that this is a climactic reunion for both of them and the attraction is as strong as ever, probably stronger  except that there are obstacles. They're not young and free any more. They have lives, commitments, involvements. . . What will happen? As the film ends, its obvious Jessie is quite happily going to miss his plane. But while Linklater & Company keep us guessing, the partial answer that comes is quite charming. ""Before Sunset"" is a superb sequel. It's touching but surprisingly unsentimental. And it's as graceful a piece of film-making as you could ever see, with the gracefulness of art that conceals artifice. Richard Linklater is one of the most interesting younger American directors. His work is authentic and personal, but has real range, from the slacker movies through the romantic encounters of Delpy and Hawke and the tight theatrical drama ""Tape"" to the inspired philosophical musings and fresh use of animation of ""Waking Life,"" and Hawke has been involved in four of Linklater's movies. Linklater and Hawke are soulmates and brothers, and Delpy is the other essential collaborator in the ""Sunset""/""Sunrise"" sequence, because she too is a writer and wrote her own dialogue and the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is too obvious to mention. It's obvious also the audience would like another sequel, and so would the actors. It's only a question of when. The inventive Richard Linklater has created a new genre: the real time sequel."
"The first question I had before seeing Sunset (in fact ever since I heard that Sunset was coming) was: ""Why?""... Why mess with Sunrise given that it was such a great stand alone film... Would they live up to answering the ""what ifs?"" would the chemistry still be there? etc. etc. ... needless to say, I think the answer is a resounding ""yes"".The film picks up nine years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine's (Julie Delpy) magical chance encounter in Vienna. This time around we find them in Paris where Jesse is wrapping up a European roadshow to promote his newly published bestseller about (what else?) that one special night. We find them now older (and Ethan looks a bit more worse for wear than Julie), more experienced, more cynical with hearts that have hardened a bit over time in spite of -- or perhaps due to -- the whimsical possibilities of that fateful night nine years prior.From the outset of the film, the director does a sublime job of drawing the viewer in with long easy takes as Jesse and Celine embark on a stroll from the bookstore to the café - almost seems as if the first exchange is captured by one long uninterrupted take with no cuts (though there are a couple). They ease into their exchange very comfortably. The questions and dialogue have the same, familiar natural feel and tone, and Hawke and Delpy both do an incredible job slipping into their earlier roles - the chemistry has not been lost. The playful sarcasm, the sexual tension, the flirting, the wit, the insecurities. All there.You can sense the longing that Jesse has (has always had) for Celine from the get-go. In fact, my take even from Sunrise was that Jesse's attraction to Celine was always more stronger - almost as if he ""needed"" her. His vulnerability and ability to ""put it all out there"" - things that guys, in general, have such a hard time doing.The film moves on to the boat which echoes the scene from Sunrise where Jesse convinces her to take a ride with him. The journey symbolizes a trip to the past where Celine realizes that Jesse's life isn't the picture perfect life that she imagined (i.e. the successful author, the wife and the kid). She almost seems to want to know  needs to have - the affirmation that Jesse still carries a torch for her, even though she (and the viewer) already should KNOW this - because WE know Jesse and his book about ""that one night"" is a tangible testament to that (this is the one plot element which I found a bit annoying).The car scene is symbolic as well as they are in an enclosed space and need to deal with the things that are bottled up inside - claustrophobic yet no escaping it. They both reveal what they have both always wanted to hear from one another (albeit in different ways and different circumstances), that they have both been truly alone since they last left each other that fateful night in Vienna. The raw emotion, the honesty - incredible moments.The culmination is the walk up the staircase to Celine's apartment, in relative silence, some things are better left unsaid  the choices, the reasoning, left unsaid. And then Celine's song which symbolizes a lot of things and demonstrates how much Jesse has meant to her even though she has a difficult time saying it in words.Nine years later, they have of course grown into full adults with all the superficial trappings that come with that  a career, relationships, etc. But, still, they are both drawn to ""that one fateful night"", and the redemption for both people is that it was just as meaningful to each person as it was for the other, for different reasons and for similar ones. The bittersweet anguish of having those memories and carrying that emotional baggage over that time echoes even deeper in the respective voids in their lives; as Celine puts it: ""memories are a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past""  almost sums up that anguish. When people are young they worry about not becoming ""someone"" - but as they get older - everyone worries about not being WITH ""someone"".In Sunset, they are both vindicated in realizing that they did not ""waste"" the last nine years living as damaged emotionless zombies - that their chance encounter was a truly magical moment changing both of their lives, that they were both ""incomplete"" without each other (ok, cue the corny music), that they really do ""complete each other"". The true beauty of Sunset is that it allows them to indulge in the luxury of what many people do not get: the opportunity for a second chance, at best, and, at worst, an opportunity for some measure of closure.And so it fittingly ends with the viewer pondering yet again ""what happens now?"" which, in retrospect, is a much more hopeful and infinitely more enviable question to answer than: ""what if?"" In sum, a wonderful film - bravo.***1/2 out of ****"
"Nine years on Celine and Jessie meet in Paris not entirely by destiny or sheer force of circumstance... Nine years ago I loved Before Sunrise so much! And identified with it even though I was far from home not out of choice - and a war of the kind that bothered Celine in Bosnia was going on in my own country... But I was young. I was 24, actually, very romantic and innocent. Now I Know how things work a little better. The world, relationships. But I'm still plunging into causes for their own sake. And I'm still a reasonably normal person. Just like the characters in this film. Paris has never looked simpler in its casual elegance. Dialogue has never seemed more natural. A script never touched real life like this one so effortlessly. I'm in love with these characters - and with the ending... This is how European Cinema used to be - and Hollywood, too for that matter. Naturally real and magical in the details."
"This is simply one of the best movies I've seen, with very few qualifications. Maybe I should say that this is one of the best ""simple"" movies I've seen. Perhaps it is a bit like cooking, use fresh and quality ingredients and you can make something great without a lot of unnecessary stuff. Unfortunately, Hollywood just doesn't seem to have the ambition to make these type of movies anymore.In any event, this is one of the few sequels that matches the intensity and integrity of the original. First, it has many simple, yet stylish and honest shots. Perhaps the Scorcese shot is used too much (i.e. following the actors on a long walk without cutting a la Goodfellas kitchen scene), but I don't think so because it makes sense in the context of the movie. Second, many of the shots have interesting emotive effect. For instance, towards the end of the movie, after these ""lovers"" are fighting the clock (because Ethan Hawke's character needs to catch a flight) and are cruising down the river, they are so engrossed in their conversation and the fact that they are trying to get so much out of the last few minutes they don't notice their ride is coming to an end. However, we the viewer can see what the characters either don't see or don't want to see, that the boat is crossing over the river to its destination and the departure no one wants to deal with. The viewer is given a wonderful sense of dread as the bank approaches in the background, because we know what is going to happen when the ride ends, and like the characters, we don't want it to end either. Even if the film borrows heavily from other great movies (e.g. My Dinner with Andre) it is independent of those influences.Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke were great per usual. Making the dialogue ring true is difficult, but they pull it off. As before, they completely capture the nature of the intimate and friendly conversational style of friends or lovers that is normally edited out of most movies. When people talk, things are not always sequential or rationale, and unlike most movies this movie doesn't try and correct that. Not for a moment does the audience find themselves thinking that this is some sort of charade and no one would ever talk like that. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful, but that is because the characters are intelligent and have a knack for being brutally honest with their thoughts and feelings.This is movie excellence, and I'm glad some film makers are still trying to make art. Despite the romantic themes this isn't a date flick, so be prepare to deal with the difficult and often unresolved issues of love and relationships that arise."
"This film is one of my favorites from last year, along with ""Sideways"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances?""Before Sunset"" is one of the best sequels ever made but it stays on its own. It is so perfect, so simple, so sublime, so clever, so romantic, and so moving that it makes me happy to know that the films like that exist and there is hope that as characters get older we may witness their next meeting and conversations.Who would think that watching two people talking may be that fascinating? That's what the power of great dialog does. As much as I loved dialogs in ""Before Sunrise"", in this film they are even better - the characters are older, wiser, more interesting, I'd say. Ten years is a long period in a human life - our characters are still young and attractive but they've gone through losses and changes, disappointments and some sad realizations about life. It is privilege of the young age to hope that ""there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with. Later in life, you realize it only happens a few times."" If we only knew how to cherish and keep these unique and unforgettable connections. If we only knew that they were unique...Julie Delpy along with Ethan Hawke, contributed to the screenplay; and there is no doubt that their contributions made the characters interacting on the screen absolutely honest and believable.Julie Delpy gives one of the best performances of the year as Celine. She is amazing in showing mystery, charm, disappointments, dreams, and the dark sides of this woman. Her singing and Nina Simone's impersonation in the last scenes of ""Before Sunset"" are among the most charming and seductive ever - oh yes, baby you will miss that plane. 9.5/10"
"A sequel to the 1995 film ""Before Sunrise"". Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and  Celine (Julie Delpy) meet 9 years after their initial meeting. They've  changed--originally they were in their 20s and full of idealism. Now  they're in their 30s--and their lives have changed in ways they didn't  predict. Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what  might have been--and it's all fascinating. Like the first film this is  basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It's  like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They've aged a  lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both  a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went  through is just incredible.   This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see  it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is  just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by  Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY  too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through.  This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended."
"I saw this movie with my husband. He is usually a die-hard fan of action thrillers, special effects and horror movies but he allows me to coax him into seeing a really thoughtful movie every once in a while. So this was my choice for the evening. Neither one of us had seen the first movie, ""Before Sunrise"", although I knew of it by reputation. Well, my husband absolutely loved the movie! He sat up and became totally engrossed in the story, frequently patting my hand at intervals as he identified with the the characters in the story. He forgot about the dreadful uncomfortable movie seat. He let up a big sigh of disappointment when the credits came up... Personally, I grew up in Paris, France, I came to the US for graduate studies and I had an environmental protection career for 20 years. So I could strongly identify with Celine, a young woman of French origin with a patina of US graduate schooling and a career in environmental protection work. Her vulnerability shines through her modern chatterbox exterior. The acting is absolutely superb, with the intimate extended conversations drawing us into the characters' lives. Certainly, this movie can stand on its own. For Jesse and Celine, the opportunity to pick up once more their romantic relationship is here! A smart couple would not let the moment pass. I doubt that they would just have a quick passionate affair... I think that the characters already know how lonely their souls can be without true love and commitment and they are emotionally ready to grasp this chance of a lifetime. They have been around long enough to know how rare their type of romantic feeling and connection can be. They will cherish their unique relationship and nurture it forever. My husband and I agreed that the movie could only be watched by couples of ""a certain age"", rather than young couples still searching for life's meaning. Only people who have lived through the throes of searching for a lifelong mate, then living through the disappointments and joys of struggling relationships, can recognize and appreciate what true love is and how important it is to go with one's heart and seize the moment. I am 48 years old and have a wonderful romantic relationship with my husband. We are each other's first and only love. Even so, we have worked very hard to keep our marriage alive and mutually passionate. Over the past 25-30 years, both of us have noticed that satisfying relationships are very difficult once people hit their thirties and forties. We have noticed that many older couples never work out their differences and end up bitter and disappointed with life. Many acquaintances of our generation are divorced or still single, never having experienced the sweetness and stability of a true romantic and committed relationship. Romance can be found all the time, from fleeting moments to short-term relationships. One sees it all over the place nowadays, in TV shows and movies, as well as in most modern relationships. However, I would like to emphasize the lasting contentment that a loving commitment brings to one's soul. This is a rare and unique blessing that is missing from too many relationships nowadays, and I find this immeasurably sad. This is a classic movie (excellent story line and top of the line acting) which goes into my list of top romantic movies of all times."
"When I saw Before Sunrise I really enjoyed it. It was the essence of every romantic travel fantasy and, lets face it, Ethan Hawke was the stuff that fantasies are made of. Having enjoyed the first movie so much I was really looking forward to the sequel but was also feeling some trepidation. What if they made a mess of it? Fortunately when I finally got to see the film any concern was put to rest. Before Sunset is everything I wanted in a sequel. The characters had matured in a way that made sense. You could see how the young Jessie and Celine had come to be these thirty-something people. There was no sickly sweet romantic perfection. These characters were clearly the product of real life, effected by their decisions good or bad, making compromises, sometimes insecure, a little scarred, but still holding on to memories and dreams of perfect moments. They are still on a journey but no longer sure that their destination is the right one. Unsure whether they can change direction, or even if they should, but afraid of what will happen if they don't.While an obvious link to the first movie the title adds to that grown up feeling of fear that time might be running out. ""Before Sunset"" emphasises that feeling of something needing to be done before it its too late. Most people have a ""What if""? somewhere in their past. You might not think about them/it often but on some level you have a question. This movie lets the characters of Jessie and Celine explore their ""What if"" nine years later, something most of us will never get to do. That that exploration is so satisfying for me as a movie goer taking a second look into their lives is a tribute to the Director and the two stars. It was obviously a great collaboration.I think the fact that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy wrote with the Director makes this a wonderfully organic script. Both of the actors seem comfortable in the skins of their characters. They carry their baggage around Paris with them and the audience isn't insulted with the fantasy that their lives stopped when they parted. There were moments of casual lightness in the dialogue and also moments that left you raw with their honesty.Sometimes the ending of a movie is a foregone conclusion. You can mentally hear the romantic music rise before the opening credits have even finished. This movie was different. In the beginning I didn't know how the movie would end or how I wanted it to end. The romantic and the realist in me couldn't quite reconcile. When the end came it surprised me with its suddenness then stunned me with its perfection. I cannot remember seeing a movie whose ending so perfectly fit its story and its characters. The moment when ""Jessie"" laughed and acknowledged, (as much to himself as to Celine), that he wouldn't be catching that plane, was the perfect place to leave, not finish, their story. A moment more would have been too much, a step towards schmaltz, a compromise to the conventional. A moment less would have left us wandering forever in the ""What If"". I am so grateful that having found the perfect moment they had the vision to stay with it."
"This is a review of ""Before Sunrise"", ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Midnight"", three films by Richard Linklater.Released in 1995, ""Before Sunrise"" finds Ethan Hawke playing Jesse, a young American who's travelling across Europe. On his way to Vienna he meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a young woman on her way to Paris. From the moment out duo lock eyes, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal, savouring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to keep him company wandering the streets. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.Like most of Linklater's films, ""Sunrise"" is both dialogue heavy and boils down to a series of discussions or ruminations on life. Our duo talk incessantly, touching upon subjects which range from language and reincarnation to sexuality and religion. Some of it is cringe-worthy, but for the most part Linklater's dialogue rings true. His banter is casual, natural, lacking in artifice, and we at times feel like voyeurs, eavesdropping on the sort of ""unimportant"" dialogue that most films shy away from. But the film is sexy as well. Celine and Jesse crackle with electricity, and Linklater pays great attention to subtle shifts in body language. There's one scene where Jesse restrains himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where our duo nervously avoid eye contact. Elsewhere the film indulges in numerous long takes, Linklater's gliding camera making the most of some gorgeous European locales, as he dips in and out of romantic alcoves and cosy spaces. Linklater's long steadicam takes lend ""Sunrise"" an ""energy"" and intimacy that many of his other films lack.Released in 2004, Linklater's ""Before Sunset"" is a sequel to 1995's ""Sunrise"". Equally good, the film joins Celine and Jesse almost a decade later. Speaking to both the mind and the heart, it finds our duo still obsessed with the night they first met, fell in love, and then somehow forgot to exchange contact details. This time around Jesse is in Paris to promote his new novel (he's now a writer), and it is Celine who tracks him down. Our couple then embark on an 80 minute chat, the fact that Jesse must leave on an afternoon flight tightening like a hang-man's noose around their conversations. The film then ends with a sequence which packs an emotional wallop.Hawke and Delpy so easily re-inhabit these characters, you have to wonder how much they're based on themselves. Simultaneously dopey and intelligent, their conversations cycle through hilarity, pain and misery. On the downside, both characters are obviously the product of an artist; Celine and Jesse are a couple of unashamed hipsters.Once again Linklater utilises long, uninterrupted takes, his gliding camera capturing vast chunks of banter and beautiful Parisian architecture. A few gentle flashbacks give glimpses of the original film, but we don't really need them. This story stands on its own as a second chance to change fate. And as is typical of Linklater, cinema's chief slacker-philosopher (at least since the death of Hal Ashby), Linklater has his film abstract several profound human truths, placing them all in a series of dialogue driven vignettes. In a way, Jesse and Celine become everyone and everything, and at times represent more than themselves.Released in 2013, ""Before Mightnight"" finds Jesse and Celine as a committed couple. It's been eight years since we last saw them, and they now live in Europe with twin girls of their own. Unsurprisingly, the puppy-love of the first two films has given way to middle-aged weariness, parental responsibility, regret and pragmatism. The film is somber, even pessimistic, and Linklater cleverly introduces several other characters who represent life and love at different stages, most notably an elderly writer and a young couple who conjure up images of Jesse and Celine's own romance almost two decades ago. If ""Sunset"" and ""Sunrise"" evoked Eric Rohmer, or Bresson's ""Four Nights of a Dreamer"", ""Midnight"" recalls Abbas Kiarostami and Rossellini's ""Journey to Italy"". Again dialogue heavy, and again reliant on long takes, the film is colder, harder and more caustic than its predecessors. Our couple now view everything with scepticism, and seem to exude a mood of grim acceptance and resignation. Most of the film's conversation revolve around death, career disappointment, transience, the world ending or technology's negative influences; the rants of a dying generation. At one point Celine even paints a dour image of the future, in which society devolves into ""masturbation and death"". In another, Jesse insists that man is ""99 percent automated"" and even goes so far as to denounce the concept of self-hood. Other conversations mock the way men measure accomplishments, and of course male obsessions with the phallus. Elsewhere an elderly man explains that couples are ""never one person, always two"". Unlike its predecessors, ""Midnight's"" sceptical of romance and even soul-mates. After a wholly contrived argument in a hotel room, a forced segment designed to set up another sequel, our duo then seem to patch up their problems, though you nevertheless suspect that this relationship has reached its end. Expect a possible fourth film to be about loneliness or separation.Early in ""Midnight"", Jesse reveals to us characters in his new book. One character lives in an unending, wondrous present (the very behaviour that brought Jesse and Celine together so many years ago), whilst another views all experiences as being ""second hand"". Jesse later talks about being ""lost in perception"" and introduces us to the ""patron saint of eyesight"", moments which exemplify Celie and Jesse's own anxieties. Both fantasise about different, better futures, and both are unsure of their partner's role in this desired world.9/10 – Whilst as good as its predecessor, ""Sunset"" may rub people the wrong way. The idea of successful, self-reflexive, middle class hipsters incessantly yapping, will prove irksome to many."
"Very few films can match up to the original first movies. 'Before Sunset' is one such. This time Linklater has co-written the screenplay with Hawke and Delpy. Jesse and Celine reunite after nine years. Things haven't turned out the way they had expected but here's a chance. 'Before Sunset' follows pretty much the same style as 'Before Sunrise'. This one too is very much a conversational piece. Here the score is used to a minimal. During the end we hear some songs including Julie Delpy's beautiful 'My Waltz'. The cinematography consists of more long shots than in the first movie. The film has a very mature feel to it. Of course Jesse and Celine are a lot more mature today and less idealistic than they were nine years ago. Linklater beautifully captures the love between these two characters as he walks us through the streets of Paris. Here too the dialogues are just as magical as in the first movie except that this time there's a melancholy about the things that could have been, the years that they could have been together. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are terrific as ever and they deserve additional praise for the writing and Ms. Delpy for her singing. Overall, 'Before Sunset' has everything that made 'Before Sunrise' a phenomenal movie experience."
"This follow-up to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be, if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people; this sequel is a more mature tale, all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film, and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film, time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse, now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again, this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other, with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.The tone of this film is very different to 'Before Sunrise' as the characters are now older and wiser and have lost some of that reckless stupidity that made the first film such a delight to observe. The anecdotes that the characters profess to one another takes a worldlier stance, and this allows the characters to revel in their newfound maturity and also develop even further than they did in the original film. In my opinion, this sequel is not as great as the first film. It comes down to personal preference in the end, but I preferred the higher energy exchanges of Before Sunrise to the more mature reflections in this film. That's not to say that Celine and Jesse have completely matured into well-rounded adults, on the contrary in fact; the immature irresponsibility that the characters once revelled in still remains, and this comes to a head at the film's conclusion.Amazingly enough, in spite of the fact that it's nine years since their first outing as Celine and Jesse; both Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply have managed to step back into their characters, and have once again achieved a glove-like fit. Julie Deply in particular is incredible this time round. There's a scene in the back of a car when she explodes into a mass of insecurity that is one of the most heartfelt showings of releasing pent-up emotions that I've ever seen on screen. Paris provides a new setting for the characters to walk around, and it makes for one that is even better than Vienna was in Before Sunrise. The city is beautiful, that's elementary, but it's the way that Linklater captures the life going on around our characters that really makes it special. While the two talk, people chat away on mobile phones, walk their dogs and drive their cars and the life around the two characters creates a wonderful atmosphere.You really need to see Before Sunrise before seeing this follow up in order to appreciate the tones and the beauty of this picture. Of course, you need to see both films anyway as they're essential viewing; so what are you waiting for?"
"I'm a movie lover. That first thing said, i have to recognize that i'm really hard on movies, and i usually discard many of them for being under-prepared, for so many errors and things like that. But with ""Before Sunset"" i felt different. We all know movies are just fakes: what happens, what we see is not the real life. It's just a construction. It's just somebody imagination becoming a visual media. But when i was watching this movie, i didn't felt that. I was seeing real people, with real problems and having thoughts, and fears and hopes. It's the most real acting i ever saw. All about it is just perfect: the ambiance, the set, the city, even the apartment we can see at the near end. Every piece of the movie was connected, and you can tell a whole story about the characters just for hear them, or seeing the way they talk, the things they said, the music they chooses or the things they have. In that way of thinking, i found this movie inspirational, a well-made piece of life, and incredibly deep and wide film. I think this is a portrait of life as only a few can know, of all the shadows and lights we all share.So, i really recommend it, even if you didn't saw the first one."
"Finally, Linklater does something with his talent. His strength in the past has been to shape the form of his films to match the subject. At least that's been true when the subject is the tentativeness of existence.He's done well enough in the past, but since his characters were aimless his projects inherited a meaninglessness. Where he tried to impart introspective layers with ""Waking Life,"" those layers were trite threads of fake profundities. Well, never mind. Artists aren't required to be particularly smart  even about who they are and what they do.What is required is the ability to discover and convey something that resonates. Usually in films the resonance is a sort of nervous recognition in the characters and situation. Sometimes, the manner of the film, the nature of the world presented is enough to engage. Such is the value of Kieslowski  and how he managed Delpy.This film tries something different, something commonly attempted and almost never achieved: the direct drama of discovery between two people. This hosts the construction not in any story or setting or even situation, though they are all employed in the service of the goals. Instead, the whole thing revolves around the tentative motions toward intimacy between two people.Why this usually fails is because of the unwieldy mechanics. In order to seem real (most reviewers call this film ""veristic"") the dramatic projection has to be hyperreal, but not so much that it appears artificial. So how do you dramatically amplify lightly probing intimacies? Its all in the most subtle hesitations of the actors, in that range beyond what ""really"" might happen and them forthrightly telling us what's happening.The construction is perfect: all movies are about other movies. In this case, we literally have the last chapter of the romance as a movie with movie values and memories. More, those are romantically captured in a book that one character carries from the previous movie into this one. Thus, all their discussion, all their reluctances are about having the present film approach the previous one.I'm astonished at the perfection of the idea, as astonished as I am about how well the two, especially Delpy, support it. This is delicate stuff.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters, who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994, meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris, they meet again, and before he has his plane back to the states they talk, and talk, and talk, and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time, if a bit more pragmatic: what it is to have concern over the environment, to live in the USA, to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized, and vice-versa.Like Bergman's films, in particular Scenes From a Marriage (if not as wholly successful because of its short running time here), Linklater provides us with characters who have no problem saying what's on their mind, in the immediate sense anyway. Jessie is even more digging-in with his cynicism and wit, and Celine with her opinions on the world at large, family and on past relationships. But when it comes to getting at their connection, it's very fragile and even unattainable because of each side's own flaws. If the two of them were happy, to be certain, there would be no movie, but it's the characters' connection to that one night in Vienna, and the second meeting that was supposed to take place six months later and never happened, and how it cripples their own romantic lives that becomes very interesting yet shallow at the same time. Perhaps this is the best way to show how smart, functional people become dysfunctional in their respective social stratospheres- Jessie is married and with a kid, but not very happy in it, and Celine is in bad relationship after bad relationship- but the singular, glossy night of years past has become a bitter shrine of sorts amid their respective neuroses.Linklater shares that incredible Bergman quality of cutting past the already sharp intellect to the emotional matter of the parties, even if it doesn't feel totally complete; I want to see how their story might end, however obvious it should and probably would be. One knows this could never work in real life, aside from the practical-side of it all, yet it's this that makes it all the more watchable. This, plus the incredibly natural repore of the actors, as Hawke and Delpy, as to be expected, seem like they aren't even on a script but are being filmed by Linklater on the fly as his camera captures the given-luscious scapes of Paris in afternoon, and the dialog is still as fresh and inviting as ever. If it lacks anything from the first it's an greater sense of the possibility for romance, since this time the sense of romance is entangled in loss and questions that Celine and Jessie want answered, however conscious they want them answered or not. But as with the first one, I still loved being around these two, who can expound a mouthful on a subject that we all might talk about, almost shockingly similar (one bit I liked a lot was Celine's story of going to Poland), and then in a slight cloud of romanticism.It ends ambiguous, maybe too ambiguous, as I found myself saying 'huh, what', but it ties into what Jessie tells the reporters at the press conference early in the film: one may take away something from this tale, or someone else another, but there it is, clear as day. Before Sunset is a straightforward romance, and proud of it, being both straightforward in romantic connection and as sharp as anything you'd never find in your local cineplex. One of Linklater's best."
"saw this movie without knowing that there was a first one called"" before sunrise"". I love it and fell in love with it. It was an awesome movie...of course its up to ur imagination if they stay together or not ( like he said at the beginning bout the book). I was so surprised at the way it ended, since I did not see the first one. Now i am trying to find the first one to watch. This is the best movie I have seen in a long long time. It deeply tocuhed my heart' I know that this is kinda of a slow movie, but it is one in a lifetime movie. BEST MOVIE. BEST MOVI EVER. I am so in love with the character and the personality of all of them. Also the imagines of the town was very good.I would recommend this movie to everyone to see. With a loved one or by yourself.I watch it @ home all by myself and it was great."
"I saw both movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, at home as DVD's and was amazed at the effect these movies had on me. I was mesmerized and entranced by the utter simplicity and beauty of the love story. The Sunrise movie takes us through a magical night in Vienna where two young (23 year old) adults fall in love. The sequel Sunset movie re-unites them nine years later in Paris. During the nine year interval, much of the idealism they had as young adults has been been overtaken by the realism that comes with life disappointments experienced in the intervening years. The dialog in both movies is so compellingly real and so natural it borders on surreal. Its like being a fly on the wall. It doesn't seem like they're acting at all. The script was written by Director Linklater, and actors Delpy and Hawke. Any guy will fall in love with Celine. Thank you, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke for creating these two small movie masterpieces. Its a must see for all romantic souls. Best movie I've seen in years. 10 out of 10."
"There are almost no words to describe this film.Almost.I saw Before Sunrise last spring, and I remember being taken with the characters and the way the movie was filmed--almost entirely in real time, line after line of amazing and honest dialogue. I really liked it, and made a resolution to see Before Sunset as soon as I could. It came on TV one day a few weeks later, and soon after became one of my favorite movies.To start, these are two of the best, most human characters ever portrayed in a film. However, it doesn't hurt that they have all the dialogue they do to develop. For anyone wishing to see a movie that breaks outside Hollywood stereotypes (as well as crosses international borders), this is the best film for you to see. Every sentence Celine and Jesse speak makes you laugh or think. Also, the lack of music is very interesting. The only musical tidbits in the movie are Celine singing Jesse her song and the two of them listening to Nina Simone in Celine's apartment at the end.Ah, the end. Just one more reason to love this movie. Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke (who collaboratively wrote the screenplay) left on an ambiguous note (just like the end of Jesse's book), a true test of whether the audience is a cynic, romantic or just not sure. After revealing their characters' naked beliefs, hopes and fears, they turn to the audience in the end for a beautiful twist.Unfortunately there are so many people who will think this film is boring, but all I ask is that you open your mind and just listen to the two of them speak. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"i will keep this brief because i do not want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it.i will say this : about halfway through this very brief film i thought it was a decent followup to a very good movie.by the end it was probably one of my three or four favorite movies of all time.If you had ANY interest in Before Sunrise, even if you only kind of liked it, see BEFORE SUNSET IMMEDIATELY.Plus, this is a movie that rewards multiple viewings. There are so many little hints, implicit and explicit, about what's going to happen to these two after the movie is over that it's really fascinating. PLus the whole film transforms the original in ways I have never seen a sequel do before.Hawke and Delpy truly deserve Oscar nominations for their heroic performances in this film.that's it. -sean"
"A truly gag-worthy inside look at the juvenile, self-serving world view which motivates Hollywood writers and producers. Ethan Hawke was physically unappealing (can't he get his teeth fixed?!), his character narcissistic beyond belief. Julie Delpy is so busy trying to be charming as her character tells Jesse about all the wonderfully righteous things she has been doing to save the planet from all the bad actors in the world who are polluting everything, while she and Jesse puff away on their ciggies. Hello? The first few minutes of interviewing Ethan Hawke's character were laughable. I simply couldn't buy the idea that any person this inarticulate could have written a novel considered a worthwhile piece of literature. Jesse (Hawke) sounds like a bumbling 19 year old college sophomore. After 30 minutes of this disgusting drivel, I decided to preserve my stomach and eject the disc.What really sickens me is the distorted view of reality depicted by these characters, who are obviously well thought of by the author and movie-makers. The way in which Celine and Jesse view the world is the view of spoiled Westerners who have no actual clue of reality, and criticize everyone else from their safe bubbles. Aside from the token concern for polluters, aren't they essentially mainly concerned with their own gratification?"
"What an utter piece of clap-trap. This is another example of a pseudo-intellectual cinematech art-house experiment that has gone tragically wrong. Unfortunately, it has now claimed the lives of many viewers who too spineless to say they hated it because expressing an honest opinion might cause them to be scorned by those who feel that this movie is a work of art. This movie was no ""Dinner with Andre"" nor was it in the league of other great script intensive movies. This was simply a bad movie. The characters were self-absorbed and terribly uninteresting. The script was stuffed with cookie-cutter philosophical quotes and paraphrases and I wanted to vomit after hearing each utterance. The city of Paris could have been used a distinct character in this movie, in the way that Tokyo was used in ""Lost in Translation"". However, the city of lights was relegated to being a cheap background as if it was on the backstage lot at Universal. Please, please, please, do not make ""Before Moonrise"". Just let the sun set on this steaming pile of tripe."
What a piece of junk. How could anyone sit through this? I was ready to throw my TV out the window watching this. I just can't imagine anyone spending so much money to come out with dribble like this. Millions of dollars and this was the result? I fell asleep after 5 minutes of this.I was bored out of my skull. I have to keep writing because I don't have enough lines for it to be submitted. I'm probably going to be blacklisted now because I didn't like movie and don't have enough bad things to say about it. How stupid is that? The movie stinks. I don't know how it got any stars at all. Is this enough?Nope. Still not enough lines. I hope I don't get blacklisted because it's so important to be able to post here. I'll probably have to kill myself if they blacklist me. Give me a break. TEN lines? I bet the same moron that thought up that idea had something to do with this horrible movie. Is this enough?
"wow. i got suckered in by so many good reviews to watch this(what the HELL is going on in this world??? who are all these people that liked this??? 0_0) while in fact this was one of the sh!ttiest movies i have ever seen. dialog is a boring pile on w@nk, and most people probably have a more interesting and warmer one when they meet someone they care about for a cup of daily coffee. Acting by Hawke and Delpy is so artificial, these people couldn't have been lovers in a million years. you can feel 0 chemistry between them and the whole movie you just have a feeling of 2 bad actors pretending they once meant something to each other, with an attempt to cover it with a series of really, really boring stories and ""oh were having so much fun together laughing to our silly jokes"" type of talk.i again, do not know how is it possible for a movie so shitty to get so many good reviews. something ain't right here."
"Thanks goodness I'm watching this on DVD (though missing out on the chance of experiencing this on the big screen) and can almost watch it immediately after watching the original. Well I could have, but I'd like to let Before Sunrise sink it a bit, before finding out how my favourite lovebirds continue with their next encounter in this sequel, filmed some nine years later, which is a very, very long time to wait for a sequel to be made.I guess the length of time in between the making of the movies helped to bring about certain gravitas to the characters played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, in that they truly age physically, no two ways about that, and along with the physical age, come the emotional baggage and history they have built over the years. You can see it in their eyes, no longer the optimistic young adults, full of enthusiasm and hope, and all those replaced by a weary sense of worldliness, with chiseled looks and skinnier frames. I think Celine was more beautiful nine years ago, and am ruing the loss of baby fat, haha!Anyway I digress. For those who are left at the cliffhanger from Before Sunrise, you'll be pleased that what happened after, and what specifically happened that night, will be revealed in this movie, though the story teases you in not having it revealed in its entirety, toying with you with coy and playfulness, just as how the characters interact then and now. In Before Sunset, we are nine years from the last meeting of Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke, with a last name to his character) and Celine (Julie Delpy), and he's now a published writer making his whirlwind book promotion in Europe. They meet in a bookstore in Paris, which takes over Vienna, and now have to spend, in almost real time, a very limited late afternoon evening together reminiscing and catching up, before Jesse's scheduled flight home to the USofA.The narrative style has also matured together with the ease with which the actors play their respective characters. You''ll notice the increase in the number of long, uninterrupted takes and dialogues, and sometimes wonder, it'll be a pain to flub your lines. Perhaps it's also because having Hawke and Delpy co-write the screenplay, they were able to inject material drawn from personal experiences to breathe life into their roles. Therefore their lines come across so naturally, you can't help but to start casting this voyeuristic look upon Jesse and Celine as you eagerly await their sharing of their lives from that moment in time, until now - their careers, their families, and the perennial what ifs, and there are many.I don't have a particular moment which I loved, unlike the previous movie, but there are certain dialogue discussed, especially during the limo ride, which struck a chord in me. Perhaps even made me understand my past relationships a little more, though regretting certain things I sure have. It made me wonder, if that was exactly how another felt, and if so, how stupid I was to have not understood, Then again, if I had, then things would be different now, wouldn't it?I'd say it again, that the movie was made enjoyable by the two main leads portrayal of lovers who can be exactly you or me, and of the fantastic conversational pieces that they have, be it flirting with each other, or discussion of serious issues. Wonderful, wonderful chemistry between them, and for fans of Delpy, you'll be glad to know that she composed and contributed 3 songs to the movie, one of which is worked into the plot, and performed on screen. I like.I liked the way it started, as if what happened in Before Sunrise was something from memory, from imagination, from the past retold in a novel. And depending on your mood, I'd like the way it ended - in a manner which could swing either way, depending on your personality, and the degree of romanticism which you have at that point. In the end, I too was made to reminisce about the one who got away, and regretting it big time. And it does make me wonder, what will happen if I chance upon her some years down the road too (I think it has now been 5?), how exactly we would react, and how we would have a conversation, if ever, during that chance meeting.To truly appreciate this movie, watch Before Sunrise first. Better yet, watch both movies back to back, it'll clock in about 181 minutes, which should breeze by given the compelling dialogue and excellent chemistry. I know I will, sometime soon!There's a slight improvement in the WB Code 3 DVD in that it contains a making-of feature called On The Set of Before Sunset. There are interviews with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, as well as director Richard Linklater. You can see how many crew were needed to film the seemingly simplest of scenes, and listen to how they collaborated across continents before finally getting together to shoot the movie. One gripe though, is that this segment lasts only 9 minutes and 40 secs long, and ends so abruptly, you'll not believe that it had finished.As usual, the audio and visual transfers are great, and you have a choice of languages in English Dolby Surround 5.1, or Portugese Dolby Surround Stereo. Another extra is the theatrical trailer, and a host of subtitles available in many languages."
"(Just mild spoiler at the end) At first I thought ""Before Sunrise"" is best to never have a sequel and left the ending open to audience's imagination. However, the director, his cast, and his team prove that they can do it. ""Before Sunset"" is simply the perfect sequel to one of the most beautiful film I've ever seen. The characters that I love so much are still themselves. They've grown, gone through good and bad times in life, but they are still the same two people we saw in Before Sunrise. The acting and the dialog is so real. It even makes you think of your own life, think of the love that has come and gone, the opportunities you've blown. However, love is still there. This film shows very well that no matter how you've blown your chances, the love in your heart doesn't go anywhere. It's just there.I like the heartbreak moment in this film. It makes you feel sadder than watching the first one, when the two were just young, honest, and romantic people that fell in love. I think Before Sunset makes it more real to life that the two people become more bitter by age and life experience.The ending is a bit too abrupt, but I like it anyway. I like the way it doesn't give you a conclusion. You can think for yourself about how this two will turn out.Now I will go and buy the DVD. This is definitely something to treasure."
"Of course I saw Before Sunrise first. If I didn't see Sunrise and jumped to this one, Before Sunset, would I still love Sunset? Maybe not. So please, if you haven't seen Before Sunrise, do not watch Before Sunset.The atmosphere is so powerful, in the movie, and between the movie and me. Sometimes I felt like I knew Jesse and Celine in person, but more often I felt I was one of them. It's not about whether I am a guy or a gal or a European or an American or any identity. The characters somehow caught a part of me, a deep part. I could almost feel what they felt. This is the most successful component of this movie.They were young and less experienced. They, I mean all of them, on the screen, behind the screen. Now, after 9 years, they came back together and produced a much richer film. Before Sunrise was a bit like a traveling movie for me. They walked from place to place. It was like that the director wanted to introduce Vienna to viewers. Jesse and Celine talked about their values of life and love on the basis of their ideals. In Before Sunset, they talked about similar issues again but on the basis of their own personal histories. It was so touching! This time, they didn't walk as many places as 9 years ago. They were not tourists anymore. They were much more certain about their journey.The performances of both actors were excellent! I mean, it was like they were talking to me. They acted with their eyes and body. It was so attractive that I didn't care where they walked. I was really into their conversation and their reaction to each other. The story went along with the words they said. Because of their great acting, I did not feel any dryness of this movie.""Everyone is independent. Nothing is forever.""----This is what I got out of Before Sunrise. And I think it also is the ideal of the young Jesse and Celine.---- They went on their own life without each other and realized something could be forever and they were not as independent as they thought they were. People can live by themselves, feeding themselves and entertaining themselves. However, people cannot just live like that. People depend on others in terms of caring and love, even though the person who loves you is physically far away from you. Jesse and Celine were independent of each other during the past 9 years but also dependent on each other mentally. Apparently, memory is the most reliable thing you can hold on to and deeply dwell in. Beautiful, isn't it? I also love the endings of both movies. The story still goes on in my head. There is no ""the end"". I wish them happy as a way to wish myself happy."
"I didn't see Before Sunrise. I think I should just come out and say that. I have been told that it adds an extra layer to the sequel and I have no doubts. It almost seems unfair for me to judge a movie this intimate without having seen its prequel. But on that note, it is impressive that the second half of this story could move me so. It's nothing more than one long conversation, probably a kin to ones that I have myself everyday. Yet there is something else here. There is something that is entirely relatable here yet still far enough out of our reach that we are sucked into the film because we want to know that magic that exists only in movies.The story starts with a book signing. Jesse (Ethan Hawke), the author of a novel about a women he met once upon a yesterday and never saw again, is at the final stop of his tour of Europe here in Paris. This is the only part of the movie where he is alone and he sets the stage for what is about to come. He delivers a monologue to the press about a story he wishes to write about a moment that turns into another moment and that morphs into yet another and so on. He is basically describing what is to take place for the next hour. He spys a woman in the corner. He spys Celine (Julie Delpy) in the corner. After he wraps it up, they begin to talk. And they don't stop. Occasionally they travel to a new location be it a café or a park. Topics flow into each other  just as Jesse told us they would.How do you write a conversation specific to two people yet understandable to anyone? Even after seeing the film I honestly cannot tell you. There is something beyond chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. That has been transformed from life to the page by these two. The co-authored the film. In a time of adaptations from every medium possible, it is hard to pick out original screenplays that stand strong and defend their category. Before Sunset is one of those rare scripts that does. The writing is the strongest part here.This is essentially Delpy and Hawke's two man show. There is no one else of importance. They are rarely separate, even sharing the shot most of the time. They wrote the film, they star in it and for all anyone can tell, they were the only ones involved. The direction is so minimal that it is virtually non-existent. And there in lies the genius but it's funny how one simplicity can overshadow another.Before Sunset is emotional provocative in the most subtle way. Were the sun to actually set in the background, you would never notice the difference. The film is shot in real time and so the sunset would sneak up on you the way the film does. One minute there's a sun and then before you know it the sky is pink and you realize you care whether or not they end up together when it seems only minutes ago they were just two people talking about whether or not they had sex nine years ago. ****/*****"
"Those months of craving, just to have a glimpse of Before Sunset is over. I finally managed to watch the movie. Though I wont discuss any technical details about the video or audio quality of the video I got. What I will be discussing is a about how did they manage to fuse Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. Those nine long years of stillness. An open ending that we just wished that someone knew how it ended. That's what kept me clinging on to Before Sunrise. It ended not with a happy nor sad ending. But it made some of us empty in some way making us want to know more about them. So what we did was to watch it all over for so many times over and over and over. And with every end of the movie we learned more about them. A hundred and five minutes of pure conversation with one another. Their glances and stares. The empty streets they've walked. The topics they discussed. Even though we watch the film for so many times we can never end this movie. They never exchanged phone numbers, never gave their address to one another. What they only have was just a promise to meet again after six months at the train station. If ever one of them gave away their phone number. We could just probably generate a happy ending, because either one of them can call the other to meet sometime. And just because of those digits, we can be rest assured that they'll see each other again.Finally after nine years of waiting we finally have a sequel. Though I hate the idea of having a sequel because it might spoil those special moments in the movie. But I just can't blame them to make one, because there are times that we should know about it. Because the movie moved us so much in a way that Jesse and Celine were more than just characters in a simple movie, but it slowly seeps into our minds often that they've became a part of ours. Before Sunset was seamlessly appended that those questions we used to ask ourselves were answered, like 'did they ever meet again?' or 'what happened after six months?' Just don't be surprised that a measly eighty minutes is short for a sequel. The film runs in real-time where Jesse has to board a plane to New York. Jesse or Jesse Wallace(they finally figured out a surname) attended a book signing of his first published book in Paris. And there she met Celine. Then the story continues where they just both walked on the streets of Paris on their way to the café. By just watching them together again made a feeling of joy and contentment within me that kept me glued to their dialogues. Again, the best thing about this movie is the simplicity. Before Sunset was just showcasing ordinary lives of two strangers who have met nine years ago on a train. I would definitely recommend it to everyone, even though you haven't seen Before Sunrise. And if you liked Before Sunset, without delay try to watch Before Sunrise to complete the picture. A+"
"Before Sunrise was a beautiful movie that catered to a romantic ideal: Jesse and Celine share a single day together, conversation flows like wine, and it all ends far to abruptly to ever know if the love was real, or merely a figment of their own hopes. Jesse is the heart-broken cynic, Celine the romantic in search of a pair. It is one of the best examples of young love ever put on screen. At the end of the first movie, you are left on your own to decide their fates.This is precisely why I never wanted there to be a sequel. It was a perfectly ambiguous movie, and the way you interpreted their future was just a reflection of your own cynicism or romantic nature. Yet Linklater decided to answer the question for us in perhaps the most beautiful way possible. For anyone who saw Sunrise when it first came out, nine years of their own lives have now passed, along with the actors. How has the passage of time affected not only the viewers' interpretations, but also the actors?This time around, Hawke plays the romantic. For nine years he has hoped and dreamed of meeting up with Celine. Conversely, for Delpy her romanticism was snuffed out the day she should have met up in Vienna. What Linklater has done is essentially recreate the entire first story all over again, only this time it's from the perspective of a 30-something. The details that got in the way of their first affair: distance, fear, uncertainty -- have been replaced with the more practical (but more serious) details of marriage, children, responsibility.If they could just go back to that point in time knowing what they know now, it would be so simple -- of course they'd get together. But life isn't that easy. Linklater has again given them a chance at true, perfect love, this time with the complications of mature adults. They both recognize how special their relationship is, but the sacrifices they would have to make to be together now have far more serious consequences. Is it worth the risk? The ending is again ambiguous -- perhaps Linklater will fill us in on the details in another 9 years.Note: while Before Sunset does reference Before Sunrise in occasional flashback blips, you really should see the original first. If you have the time, you might try waiting a few years before watching the sequel to truly appreciate it -- though this isn't completely necessary."
"The first of two critically acclaimed sequels to the critically acclaimed Before Sunsrise (1995) see's us catching up with Jesse & Celine 9yrs later.I found the first to be a dull, slow, ""Talkie"" film with little appeal and claim the same here. I simply do not see the attraction at all.Hawke is unlikeable again, Delpy is devoid of the charm she had in the first and the whole film feels like a desperate attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first with yet another ambiguous finale.I like the idea of the simplicity behind both films, I guess I just didn't appreciate the lines of conversation or the way they ended them both.I believe the films would have been a lot more appealing if they'd both shut the hell up, strapped a go-pro camera on and just given us 90 minutes of of the wonderful country and it's architecture."
"Before Sunset is movie so genuine and true to the heart, where two people fall deeply in love without even expressing the words ""I love you"" or even sharing a mere kiss on screen.I have never seen two people interact like those two in ""real life"" or in any other movie. The connection they shared was equally possible as it was unrealistic, but it was in simplest terms a miracle.Even though I haven't witnessed such a miracle, I believe in it, as rare as it is.But, in this life, there are no happy endings, and it's only the path we take to our miserable end which has potential for ""happiness."" Without any reference to statistics and with no intention to hurt the feelings of anyone who might be ""in love"", 99% of the world does not experience this kind of love. Unfortunately for many, the love in this movie is ""true love"", which in effect means if you are not experiencing this kind of love, you are not experiencing true love.The characters do, suggestively, end in a miserable end. But the moments they share is when they experience the greatest happiness known to man.Do yourself and the world a favour and watch and fall in love with this movie. Because I can guarantee that even if I don't find true love with a woman, I can be sure I felt it by witnessing the pure magic in the gem.The only movie ever to bring me to tears! It had a profound affect on me when I watched it and still does. The original is almost as good, but this one had something extra in it to bring me to tears.If you don't understand even one part of what I'm talking about after you watched this miracle, then unfortunately you have zero chance of experiencing true love.This may me my favourite movie of all time!"
"Unfolding almost in real-time, this is a story about another chance for love that was once lost. Set nine years after they first met, Jesse and Celine find themselves older and wiser and still crazy about each other. They meet in a bookstore where Jesse is on tour for his best-selling novel which, incidentally, is a transcript of their magical night in Vienna long ago. He needs to leave for the airport soon and they have just about an hour to spend with each other in Paris. This film is going down in movie history for me as one in my all-time top ten favorite romantic films. It is even better than its 1995 prequel, which was already magnificent in itself. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have unbelievable chemistry. Their two characters are even more real than when they were first introduced all those years ago. Their love for each other just bounces off the screen. This is terribly remarkable film-making. The immediate sequences are a direct metaphor to the urgency of their situation, how little time they have. It is beautiful. I can't even spot the longest shot. It must have taken a real effort for those two actors to pull off these great performances, long dialogues and all. The best part about this film is that it can be seen as a stand-alone. You don't have to have already seen Before Sunrise. Watch it and I swear you won't regret it.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews"
"I am so in love with Celine. She is the perfect woman - caring concerned, intelligent - I could listen to her forever. And, take her and put Juile Delpy's voice into her and i am in heaven. Delpy (Hoax, Broken Flowers) turns in an enchanting performance with Ethan Hawke (Training Day), as two lovers who lost each other nine years ago and meet again in Paris.It is obvious from the start that Jesse (Hawke) has never went a day without regretting what happened. Celine appears to shrug it off but, no matter how hard she tries, it comes out that her life has also been affected. The entire film is a conversation between the two that says so much. I know the century is young, but this is definitely one of the best films so far.Director Richard Linklater (screenplay/story) , Julie Delpy(screenplay) , Ethan Hawke (screenplay) , and Kim Krizan (story) have written a wonderful film that will stand the test of time."
"Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were just sublime in ""Before Sunset"", the sequel to their 1994's ""Before Sunrise"". Essentially, it's a movie about nothing -- the two of them see each other for the first time after nine years and just walk and talk; yet, at the same time, it's about everything and anything we truly care, desire, and hope for in life. It's about love, our perception of it, our yearning to attain it, and our disappointments for our inability to put a grasp on it. Nine years later, we see clearly the signs of dissatisfaction and disappointments on their faces. Frustrated with the banality of life, yet imprisoned by the vast responsibilities to themselves and the ones they love to endure its miseries, the two of them are no longer as hopeful, nor as romantic about life and love, like they were nine years ago. There is less dreaming this time, more about reality, more about the pains experienced and the compromises made in life. There are also regrets, regrets about this lost love, and tears, tears held back in their eyes wondering what could've been. But the sparks and longings they saw and felt long ago were still palpable, just like they were the night they first met. By the end of the film, it's clear that not all is lost, their love is buried some where deep down in their hearts, cherished by their memories of that one encounter almost a decade ago. And for us, it's always comforting to know that perhaps, just perhaps, their love could eventually prevail, for after all, we are all hopeless romantics struggling to live a life of love and dream."
"Hi everybody¡¡I'm from Spain and my English is not very good, but I'll do my best.This is my first review in IMDb on a movie. Here in Spain Before Sunset came out the last Friday. The first time that I heard about Before Sunset was in the Berlinale and I was really surprise and since then I've been looking for information (spoilers) on the net (I couldn't avoid it). I read great reviews about the movie and I was looking forward to see it, here in Spain great reviews too, by the way.I took a friend of mine to see B. Sunset with me, but previously I let her see B. Sunrise and she liked it, but she was not as enthusiastic with Before Sunrise as I was, but she told me ""I will go with you to see B. Sunset, now that I saw the first one, I want to know what happens to Jesse and Celinne"", so the last Sunday we saw Before Sunset and at the end of the film my friend told me ""Don't tell me that this is the end, I want more!!"". Our verdict is : FANTASTIC, BEAUTIFUL, my friend liked it much more than Before Sunrise. She told me that when Celinne was singing the waltz, she almost burst into tears, we loved the movie.I already knew more or less what the movie was about, but of course one thing is reading spoilers and another seeing the movie. Anyhow I have some comments about:The duration: too short, probably because I enjoyed it so much, maybe 10 or 20 minutes more it would be fine.The ending:Don't get me wrong I love the ending, but I don't know maybe deep inside I would love to know what happens to them, I must admit that I root for them and I want them together, so here is my last point...The third movie: After seeing both movies, my friend and I agree that we need another one. In fact we think that Before Sunset needs a continuation more that Before Sunrise did. In my opinion, Before Sunrise's ending was more complete, a little bit more closer that Before Sunset's. In Before Sunset left us with many questions without answers and as I said before I need to know a little bit more.Like ¿Are they really in love? they have a great connection but love is a major word for me. They spent very shorts periods of time together, a night, and 1hour and 20 and nothing else, I'd love to see them together in a longer space of time, or maybe as celinne said they are good only in brief encounters in different cities of Europe. I don't know this is a beautiful movie but very very sad at the same time.I hope that Ethan, Julie and Richard make another great movie, but only as they say in many interviews that I read, if they have something more to say, and I hope that if they want to, they will surprise us with another great movie, even better. PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME, BUT NOT ANOTHER 10 YEARS."
"In Paris, the American writer Jesse Howard (Ethan Hawk) is in the end of an European tour, promoting his novel about the one night stand he had with a young French woman nine years ago. In the end of the debates in a bookstore, he finds Celine (Julie Delpy) in the audience, who works in an environmental organization, and they leave the place to drink coffee and talk to each other before Jesse goes to the airport. Along the moments together, they realize that they are still in love for each other.""Before Sunset"" is a delightful sequel of ""Before Sunrise"", which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful romances I have ever seen. The screenplay was written by Ethan Hawk, Julie Delpy and Richard Linklater and it is fantastic, with wonderful dialogs. It is also amazing the natural performances of Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy, who intensively live the characters of Jesse and Celine. It is impossible not liking this movie! The simple song sang by Julie Delpy is a great complement to this lovely fairy tale. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Antes do Pôr-do-Sol"" (""Before Sunset"")"
"This is in the neighborhood of the worst crap i have ever seen om film. Totally uninteresting, i could rather have composed a movie about my parents any given afternoon. Except that my parents are way more lively than the characters in this movie.I actually left the movie rolling while getting snacks. The only reason that i actually saw the whole thing is that i have given myself a promise that I wont back out of a movie even if the film stinks. And this movie was just not in the same universe that I am.If you are into this kind of depressing love stories, please try to get help !"
"Before Sunset (2004) **** (out of 4) Nine years after the events in BEFORE SUNRISE, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) returns to Paris to do a Q&A for his book, which just happens to talk about that night in Vienna. Celine (Julie Delpy) winds up coming to the event and afterwards they've got a little over a hour to catch up on what's been going on in their lives. BEFORE SUNSET is clearly an improvement over the already very good first film but what makes this one here even more special is that it captures the magic of the first picture while at the same time taking a look at the darker issues in their lives. As with the first film, it's really amazing how director Richard Linklater managed to make this feel like a documentary that you're watching and not once do you see Hawke and Delpy as actors but instead you see them as real people that are simply being filmed by an invisible camera. The film manages to really make you believe that the story is picking up nine years after the previous film and I must say that the explanation for the ending of the first movie is extremely well handled. I'm not going to spoil what happened six months later but it's perfectly handled here. Even the first appearance of Celine is extremely beautiful and perfectly done. I really liked the dialogue here but I also like the fact that it once again comes across so real. I say this because I viewed this at the same age of the characters and I thought their feelings on growing older are so true. Hearing Hawke talk about his son and relationships is just something one can connect with and like the previous film the situations make you feel as if you could be the one doing the talking or at least you know someone like these characters. Once again both Hawke and Delpy are terrific together and really fit back well in their characters. There are more emotional or dramatic moments here and both handle them well. Linklater, who wrote the script with the two stars, keeps the film moving at a great pace and really manages to make one fall for the situation that these two are in."
"Before sunset is a terrible excuse for a movie. The scenes were dry and boring. This movie literally put me and my guest to sleep. It's the most embarrassing display of cinematic performance my eyes have ever seen. The script was pointless and the acting was pathetic. This movie was far from realistic. I feel that no person should suffer through this two hour torture. I had high expectations for this movie, it looked very entertaining. Looking forward to this movie was a colossal mistake. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.. it is a huge waste of time, money, an opportunity to watch something decent. The only positive thing about this is that I had a nice nap.If you have any smarts at all you will not waste part of your life watching this overrated, senseless, boring, pathetic piece of garbage. This movie doesn't belong in theaters, DVD's or VHS, it belongs in a dumpster next to its own kind.... two week old GARBAGE!"
"the dialogue is horrible, just god awful, the scenes of Paris completely unreal, unless Hawke and Delpy have superpowers there is no way they could have covered that much ground in such a short time, AND at the end of the movie it is implied that he is going to ditch his kid. what a let down after loving the first movie so much. it seemed that the two main characters were blabbing on and on just to hear themselves talk. Terrible, soap opera over dramatized acting, way too many unnecessary sexual references, and none of the sweetness of the first film. Even the street scenes were unenjoyable because the geography was so screwed up - example - at no point in its 2 mile course does the Promenade Plantee lead directly to the Seine.ugh. what a waste of 80 minutes."
"This film lacked all the charm of the first. In Before Sunrise we have this intriguing & alluring physical attraction and intellectual interest between two characters that ""destiny"" has united on a train. We follow them through an exhilaratingly spontaneous evening as their youthfully curious sensual dynamism develops. Their dialogue is interesting and sincere, and their attraction is sweet and sort of nostalgia-evoking. In the second this is all replaced with dialogue that feels contrived and scripted, and which reeks of pseudo-intellectualism. Let's just set aside the fact that the endearing young love of the first is replaced with a pent up lust in the second, so that we can focus on the fact that Hawke's character is married during this little escapade, which renders the whole attraction categorically repugnant. Maybe things won't to work out in his marriage anyway, but people with integrity honor their marriage until it is over. Are we suppose to identify with and/or sympathize with this character?!? Get a divorce and fool around, or exercise the most minimal amount of self-respect & dignity and follow through with your own commitment. Moving the promenade to the streets of Paris felt predictable and petty to me, it didn't save the movie, and finally, the film itself felt low-budget. I don't recommend Before Sunset to anyone who isn't middle-aged, divorced, and looking for consolation in a story of unscrupulous mediocrity. I do say that reluctantly, and apologize for its harshness, but that is the brutal truth. It's a middle aged, unaccountably cynical, and trite remake of the first, but 10 years later in Paris."
"I was surprised how many in the audience of ""Before Sunset"" had not seen the previous ""Before Sunrise"" as I didn't think it was possible to follow it, let alone appreciate the dialogue, stand-alone.  This ""Part Deux,"" as it takes place in instantly recognizable Paris, contains less explanatory flashback material than the consequently essential trailer did, as the premise for the movie is a specific ""what if?"" portend of future potential regret that Ethan Hawke's Jesse used to seduce Julie Delpy's Celine for a night around Vienna almost ten years ago.  How can someone who hasn't seen the first film judge the tricks memory may be playing on each character if you don't know what you remember really happened?  It is a wonderful premise and creative writing collaboration among director Richard Linklater and the stars to have the characters revisited in the real time of being older in a real time conversation that is filmed a la Eric Rohmer, like his ""Les Rendez-vous de Paris."" The movie carries an additional subtext that shadows the characters and adds to the complexity.  Back in 1995, Hawke was at his most earnestly, shaggily adorable and Delpy was an up-and-coming starlet.  But now we've seen Hawke rise to an Oscar nomination, as well as a novelist like Jesse, while becoming tabloid fodder for the break-up of his family with Uma Thurman, and he bears a gaunt, haunted, shorn look.  Delpy has during this time only surfaced occasionally to American audiences, so that her strong, luminous character here is particularly captivating and believable as a professional activist as well as a songwriter (quite sweet on the soundtrack and probably on her own CD, too) and you simply can't take your eyes off her.  She nicely counters the image of her delicate beauty with frank exchanges and well-kicked profanity. Elements of the premise have been done to exaggerated comic effect in the Western satire ""From Noon Till Three"" Neil Simon's ""Same Time Next Year"" and ""The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares),"" but this feels natural.
Where the earlier movie had the charm of a late night, dorm room bull session resonant of  the potentials of youth, this one is an amusing probing of protective defenses to honestly reveal thwarted, older and trying to be wiser expectations as they circle each other to consider once again grabbing what could be the brass ring amidst the complicated real lives they have built. This ending is as deliciously open-ended as the first and I look forward to revisiting Jesse and Celine ten years hence."
"What chances would you give to an 80 minute film to hold your attention which has nothing but an American man Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and a Parisian woman Celine (Julie Delphy) talking? Not much I would imagine. Well, this film not only grabs and holds your attention but makes you fall in love with the characters like the prequel ""Before Sunrise"". Our young protagonists in their early 20s were in Vienna for the day. In ""Before Sunset"", they are in Paris, 9 years from their tryst in Vienna, having lost complete contact of each other during the time.We follow these characters as they have grown from their previous romantic meeting, become more matured, responsible, more cynical and probably more regretful for their predicament to be apart. It is intriguing to listen to their delightful conversations to listen to as they walk through Paris and one of the reasons for that is, Julie and Ethan have written their own dialogs. Which makes the performances look so completely non-rehearsed and natural. It brings to life their characters which is all we remember of the film and it is most that as an actor and writer you can achieve.Linklater has always been a master of conversations, although he has set a very high yardstick in terms of the quality of it. It has to be engaging, quirky, real, meaningful. He is a master director and the diversity of his filmography speaks for itself. There is always a sense of languid ease to his film, maybe reflective of his persona.A great love story. One that will stand the test of time and will definitely touch your heart."
"When I watched the movie I did not know of 'Before Sunrise'. Now I would like to watch that also!! What a great movie!! I never thought how much importance conversation holds in a human being's life. Hats off to director,actors, dialog writer and all involved in the movie. The movie reminded me of meeting a long-lost friend after a long time and how you catch up. Though the movie speaks of lovers it can be applied to any relationship. The flow of the movie was of calm river undisturbed by external things. I felt a sense of relaxation while I watched the movie. We get to see Paris and how when you spend more time with each other your inner feelings tumble out. Is it not strange one is able to connect to somebody 9 years later without much inhibitions? A movie worth adding to your personal library."
"This movie may be heralded at an anticipated sequel, but it is definitely a letdown for any expectation of any type of value other to be a sort of vouyer that takes pleasure in listening in on a conversation between two people with some severe emotional issues.I would say rent this movie(hopefully you did not pay to see it in a cinema yet) only if you are desperate for something to watch.Better yet, borrow it from someone if you can. You will be glad you did not pay to see it.The only people I can think of that would be even remotely entertained by this low budget and cheesy movie, are people that have problems talking to the opposite sex and want to see how silly they may appear to someone that might overhear what they say to others."
"It was a cheap matinee.  The movie bored me.  Yackity yackity yack.  I kept waiting for it to be over.  Finally, I was over, thank goodness.  I thought about it a few hours later and reflected on how boring it was and now, 24 hours later, its even more boring. The only thing good was the cute little dance the woman did at fade-out. Actually fade-out was the best thing.  I have to use ten lines to make this post.  So, here goes: Boring. Boring Boring Boring"
"Before I went to see Before Sunrise at its June 26, 2004 Austin Premiere last night I read the reviews written here at imdb.com to get an idea of what to expect. However none of the reviews prepared me for the excellence of this movie.As you probably already know, the entire movie is basically of one conversation between two people who (at least seemed to) fall in love nine years previously but had not seen one another again until this day having relied on one date for another rendezvous in Venice -- and having failed to exchange phone numbers, addresses, etc.First of all, the acting was nothing less than excellent, lacking self-consciousness and ""over the top"" theatricality. Much credit for this I'm sure goes to Rick Linklater, the Director, who told us last night after the screening that it was very important to him that it not ""get dramatic."" Ah...a fine director, is like fine wine, no?  Bravisimo!By the way, I also learned at the Q&A last night -- which was with Richard Linklater and the two stars, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy -- and was fascinated to learn that ALL THREE OF THEM wrote this script. To me, that helps to explain how the script could have come out so profoundly well -- full of meaningful insights, questions that are asked by hearts with a bottom line of love and warmth. What I am going to say next is something I have said before about BOOKS, but never about MOVIES -- not for the same reason. That is, I want to see this movie again -- and again -- and again so that I won't miss a line. There is so much to think about and care about among the topics discussed -- about love and life and the world we live in. Some of the things expressed were so interesting to me that I found my own mind running off with a thread of thought for a few moments after hearing what was said. It was just so stimulating. But then I would have to force myself to drop the thought in order to put my attention back to what they were saying lest I miss out on yet another pearl of humor, enjoyment, wisdom, riddle or profundity. I tried hard, but for me hearing ALL of it in one showing could just not be done. I will have to seen the movie again and again until I feel satisfied I have eeked the ""last drop."" And NO, I am not implying that the ending is a letdown; in my opinion it is a delightful ending and I hope-hope-hope that in another 7-8 years these collaborators will get together to write us another script. I want them to wait that long before writing it though, so that they can bring ever more wisdom and maturity to each sequel.Thank you, Rick; thank you, Julie; thank you, Ethan! How REFRESHING and NEEDED it is in our world today to have MEANINGFUL entertainment where the bottom line is where it should be -- for and about thinking and caring human beings. And by the way, Julie and Ethan have noticeably aged; Julie is (indeed) thinner and more mature, a fascinating natural beauty with that sexy French accent; Ethan's resemblance to Tom Cruise startles me. Yet there is another dimension to Ethan and I hope I don't make anyone angry to say I also prefer his acting over the former's. I very, very, very rarely pay full retail price for my own VHS or DVD of a film. I can't wait to buy this one and I look forward to watching it again with happy anticipation.
10 Stars!"
"From the teasers, trailers, and other hype for this movie it sounds very romantic: boy meets girl in a European city, they have a tristfull day together, they part ways for 9 years, they meet again in a European city to possibly rekindle the flame. Well, have I got a surprise for you. This movie contains little more than A and B long shots, which to you non-film uber-nerd folks means person A talking and then person B talking for long takes with few or no cuts. There are also very few ellipses, which means that the story is in real time. Therefore, all this movie contains is talking between the two characters for about an hour an a half on any mundane subject from religion to love to world pollution to politics and on and on and on and on. Enjoy!"
"I really don't understand how this movie got nominated for an award or how anyone can really like it. If I had known people would enjoy watching people have a conversation about the previous movie, I would have made this sequel. The conversation in the movie, I though was very dull. The movie lasts a little over an hour and most of the time I spent trying to keep my eyes open. My fiancé didn't even like this movie and she likes all romantic movies. I would only recommend this movie to maybe a 13 year old girl cause thats about how creative the storyline is. I'm still not sure of the plot. All in all I thought it really sucked."
"An arduous journey with a humbling American author and an irritating, pretentious and neurotic former lover. All the dense dialogue of a Tarantino movie with none of the depth; story or real character development.... .... Other than the cool filming, walking;boating; and driving around the fine sights of Paris, this movie is desperate. Whilst fans of the first movie may relish revisiting an otherwise defunkt love affair, first-time viewers of this tesco-value saga may struggle to stay awake. A revisit of a dead love affair... But more importantly, A depressing waste of time!"
"first of all, this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire long life. it's really bad!!! i can't believe how it got an Oscar nomination and a rating of 8 :O I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ON THIS EARTH ANYMORE!!! how can people be so stupid and like this movie! i mean what the f*ck is wrong with them :O 10 lines aren't enough to talk about this awful movie. what can i say more about it ? i struggled to stay awake while watching it and couldn't stop my eyes from closing. if i wanted to hear to people having a conversation i would have spied on my neighbors which probably would have been much much much more interesting than this sh*t i spent 80 minutes of my life watching it. how can a movie have only 2 main actors ??? it probably didn't cost a dime. I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO Watch THIS!! GO DO SOMETHING USEFUL WITH YOUR LIFE! AND TO THE PEOPLE WHO RATED IT 8 : GO GET A LIFE !OR GO DIE ! THE END."
"Six months after they originally met traveling around Europe, Jesse went to the place that Celine had agreed to meet him only to be left by himself. Almost a decade later Jesse has written a book based on this one night meeting and is on an European tour. At the Paris location, Celine arrives to meet up with him. Overjoyed to see her again but pressured to leave for the airport in an hour and a half, Jesse goes for coffee and a walk with her in order to talk and catch up.Its been almost 10 years since I saw the original movie and had a vague recollection of it but I wanted to go to the cinema to see a film. I was left with a choice of Spiderman 2 or this film and I plumped for Before Sunset (although I will see Spidy another time). The film opens with some flashbacks and a rather pretentious Jesse talking about his book before the film proper starts with the pair taking yet another walk. From here on in you need to be in at least a semi-romantic mood or the pace and tone of this film will just grate on you. For me, I was open to see where it went and, although some of it was a bit cheesy at times, generally I was carried along with it. The tone is quite natural and the romance is not forced, in fact it isn't really that much for a love story for the majority. The long conversations are enjoyable and engaging and it is these that gets us into these people's lives just enough to care about them. The wandering film continues to a conclusion that may frustrate some but was perfect for my needs. For my money it was the sheer amiable mood of this film that made it enjoyable. At the end of the film I had a little smile on my face and, although it was only a fleeting feeling from a film that won't stick in my head long, I did feel a little warm thanks to the film.Of course it isn't perfect and it will be easy for the 'real men' in the world to just dismiss it as nonsense and, partly, they are correct. The dialogue at times is very natural and seems to fit the characters but at other times it is very close to being part of a fondue set. Likewise the characters are not as 'real' as I would have liked  she's an environmental saviour and is pretty and friendly; he's a sensitive author type who has youthful good looks etc. At the start of the film the two actors played the characters very eager and all smiles and I hoped that they were doing this in the way we all do when meeting someone  putting on the pleasantries. But I hope that this would fade as hurt etc came out; it came but it was left very late in the film and the material was kept just a bit too sweet. Delpy is still good despite her rather self-righteous character but it took me longer to warm to Hawke who, although likable, was unconvincing as the man that the script told us Jesse had become. The two have a good chemistry though, and it is fun to walk through Paris with them listening to their conversations that are interesting, pretentious, flirting, funny and cheesy  but still enjoyable to sit through.Director Linklater does a good job using Paris as a backdrop without going for the really obvious locations or landmarks in a touristy film type of way. More than that though, I was impressed by the technical aspect of the film  long tracking shots in one take and an impressive moment where the camera follows them (from the side) up two flights of stairs. As writer he did OK and, if you're not able to accept a little bit of romantic dialogue and warm chat then you're in the wrong movie.Overall I enjoyed the movie but, had I been in the mood for action then I would have been less patient with it. At 80 minutes it is brief and sweet and left me feeling a little warm inside for a while afterwards. It is not the type of film that will stick in my memory for months to come but it did the trick for 80 minutes  I wandered round Paris listening to friends chatting. It's not all perfect  far from it, but it is fun if you're in the mood. As the final shot faded, the audience got up to leave with little smiles on their faces and everyone was polite and friendly as we left  I came out into the corridor as an earlier Spiderman 2 had just finished in the other screen and the place was packed with running teenagers, hyper kids, hassled parents  all a bit hyped up and bustling; in other words  for a calm, peaceful and warm Sunday afternoon I had picked the right movie to go to and, if that's what you want then try Before Sunset."
"First of all, let me state that I'm a sucker for romantic movies. Romeo & Juliet, The Notebook, Titanic... you name them! But this movie, wow. How can you NOT be disappointed ? The worst thing is seeing it having a high rating here on IMDb and being on the ""Best Movies"" list. Something HAS to be wrong here. The people who give it a 10 out of 10 obviously have some issues.Since I've never heard of a first movie based upon these 2 characters, I did not see it (Before sunrise) so maybe this didn't help. But how on earth do people appreciate or waste money on this ? This is by far, the most awful movie I have ever seen in my life. The only thing they do is talk talk talk and NOTHING happens. I thought it was going to be like this for 15 or 20 minutes ? No, for 80 minutes ! How on earth can you make a movie out of 2 people having a boring conversation ? I didn't even ""feel"" the chemistry between these two.A total waste of time and money, for the people who MADE this movie and for the people (who like me) wanted to see this. I wish I could have my 80 minutes back."
"""Before Sunset"" is an open-ended and worthy sequel to the very popular romantic niche film ""Before Sunrise"". However, it will have little meaning or magic for those who have not seen the original 1995 film. Therefore....If you saw ""Before Sunrise"" and liked it, this film is a must see.If you saw ""Before Sunrise"" and didn't like it, pass on this film.If you didn't see ""Before Sunrise"", check it out on this website and see if you want to give it a try. If you don't enjoy it, pass on this film. If you enjoy it, you won't want to miss this film. The pair will make a great back-to-back watch. (B)"
"Can a movie consisting of nothing more than plain dialogue and superficial interaction between two people who look back on one night of passion they shared a decade before -- two people who spend almost the entire movie doing nothing more than chatting and walking through sunlit, winding streets -- transcend its simple form to become one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of the last decade? No. It is one of the least interesting ways to spend an evening with one's loved one.I couldn't help giggling at the part when she says she had only three songs, one of which is about a cat. How I wished she would have launched into a Phoebe-like rendition of ""Smelly Cat!""Utterly boring."
"Hitchcock's aphorism, ""Film is life with the boring bits cut out"" has been contradicted by ""Before Sunset"" - a film with the dramatic bits cut out and nothing left but tedious blathering.The premise seems promising enough:  two characters - amazingly reunited after a one night stand nine years earlier - talk for 95 minutes.  They are clearly drawn to one another but have moved on in their :lives.  We hang on wondering whether or not they will leave their current lives and partners and remain together, or go their separate ways once again.The film feels like an extended improvised acting exercise or a really bad soap opera scene that doesn't know when to stop.  The characters blather on and on but their conversation is flat; it lacks wit or charm.  We're left to stare at these two young actors jabbering about getting old:  Julie Delpy looks self-consciously coy - the years have given her face a bit more interest but she's lost some of her girlish sensualness; Ethan Hawke. looks more and more like Tom Cruise, flashing his eyes and baring his enormous white teeth.  Probably a master like Woody Allen could have sustained this situation with wit and intelligence.  But here the actors are left to direct the show themselves; wallow in horrible, self indulgent, shallow, vacuous conversation.  It's downright painful and even embarrassing to watch."
"I really don't understand the comments or how anyone could like this film, I mean what was the Point? I sat through this with my other half, Only because I was under the misapprehension that she was enjoying it, you know being a woman and all. But no, she was just as bored as I was. This was boring, pretentious Guff. All they do is walk around Paris Chatting rubbish. It was like following two people around and listening to bits of their conversation. I gave up. Just so Glad that I didn't pay for this rubbish. Not so Say that I don't enjoy a romantic film, I do. Furthermore I judge a film on it's quality not it's Genre. Even So I didn't find it romantic it was just two people droning on. It was just 1hr 20 Min's of DrossGive me Killing Zoe any day"
"I love Richard Linklater. He's a terrific filmmaker who's made some of my favorite films. I think Waking Life is absolutely brilliant. However, in my opinion, he's also made some duds. But that is the price of pushing the envelope and I don't want to discourage that. I too thought that Before Sunrise was a warm and wonderful film. I'm a huge Julie Delpy fan. I think the idea of having the actors from the original film contribute to the screenplay of the sequel is inspired. Bravo Richard, Bravo! I love that about you. What I didn't love was the result. Basically it didn't go anywhere. Flat beginning, middle and end. No magic. Maybe that is what it was trying to convey, the loss of magic, inability to recapture the magic. But why make a film about that? Why end the story of these two characters on a down note? You should have avoided the sequel and let us imagine a better future for them.I wouldn't be writing this except that I was perusing the top 250 list and was shocked to find this on it. Now I accept the fact that the list contains goofy choices and omits some outstanding films. I'm used to that. But, WOW! Its just getting wackier."
"I saw this on the recommendation of a guy I happened to meet by chance...oh man, he even suggested we go to Vienna! What an utter pile of drivel. Admittedly I came from a negative bias because I hated Linklaters Waking Life, so I was expecting something along the same lines. No surprises.How can she be so stupid? Doesn't she know he's completely in love with her?! Why does she continue to lead him on? How can he marry someone he doesn't love? Why the hell didn't he try to find her?! This was so unrealistic, the acting was forced and painful to watch. Oh, and the dialogue?! Jesus, someone shot them both already! (would that be the best!) True to form Linklater has once again produced a trite, over-indulgent, ego-tripping, contrived piece of crap. It's said nothing, it never wanted to say anything, so what was the f***king point?! You are banned from my life Linklater. Never again. No, I didn't go to Vienna with that guy, and on the basis of this garbage, never will."
"I really missed something with this film. Usually, when it gets so many raves, I end up loving it as well. I thought that the one on-going scene was annoying and that the characters were so completely self-absorbed that it ultimately turned me off. Ethan Hawke's answers at the beginning did not feel like real answers to me (""Isn't everything autobiographical?"" - What does that mean?), and Julie Delpy's role didn't seem personable or that deep. The dialog to me seemed so stilted that I got uncomfortable just watching the movie. The neat thing about this movie is that it really is centered on just those two characters. When that is done well, it can be riveting. But that makes it high risk - if you don't like the characters, there is nothing else in the movie. I didn't like the characters, so for me, the movie was a turn off."
"Damn it! I felt they cut short this film. Whenever we hear the word SEQUEL, it feels like a recipe for disaster...there are very few instances in this world where sequel was as good or better than the first movie.This movie is one of those few instances. Two words that describe this movie are- JUST GREAT. It was a pleasure to watch both the movies simultaneously one after the other.The Ending was truly fantastic, keeps the viewer guessing & gasping for more. I loved it & wanted to see more of the chemistry between Jesse and Celine. One more fact that is unbelievable is that there is no kissing scene.A romantic film without a single kiss & mostly based on the conversation between the actors makes you question how is it possible??...Well for the answer you have to see this movie. The scene in the van, where they finally unburden themselves. One of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays I've seen. The only possible flaw was they didn't show more places in Paris.9.3/10"
"The perfect ending for the perfect couple...Although i prefer realistic endings and i kind of hate the happy end,I wanted these two people together...The most romantic story for two great characters.Paris,also with its elegance makes the movie adorable.You almost forget that you are watching a film.You are just wandering around Paris.Nice and substantial conversations about life and love and a great end which leaves you with the sweet taste of love without giving all this useless information about their later life...They are together for now,and we don't care what is going to happen...They will find their way... Oh,it was so lovely!!!"
"Before Sunset is the sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, and is equally amazing. The on-screen chemistry between Ethan Hawke (as Jesse) and Julie Delpy (as Celine) alone makes them worth watching. In the first installment, the two characters meet on a train in Europe and end up walking around Vienna together for the rest of the day. At the end of the film they decide to meet again in six months at the same train station. The second film is set nine years later. Jesse has written a book about their time in Vienna, and is on the last day of his tour in France. Celine meets him after the book signing, and they spend the remaining time together until his flight leaves. Before Sunset retains the casual banter and romance from the first film, but it's more serious and less fanciful. It shows how the two have grown up, which is shown through their many conversations throughout the film."
"This movie is for those diligent viewers who are looking for a serene and pacifying movie. I walked into the theater with 2 my friends and I was the only one to sit there till the end. This movie runs on a slow note and is a perfect sequel to the part-1. Before you watch this movie, i would recommend you to watch the previous part. By the end of first part, the two characters decide to meet at a spot which they were expected to do by the beginning of the second part, but quite contrary (yet very realistic) to it, they couldn't. The way they find each other is awesome which is depicted in a very beautiful way. The movie then again runs on a smooth note and they start rediscovering each other again. Hawke and Delpy are the only two faces you are gonna find throughout the movie but you feel like witnessing two worlds walking languidly. The climax of the movie is more than what one could ever expect. It ends at a note that's as sweet as a jack fruit and keeps revolving inside your mind for the next couple of days. This movie falls into the category of Sweet Land, Lost in Translation and Finding Neverland. I would rate this movie a 10 upon 10 and highly recommend it for sensible viewers like me who know how deep an uttered word could go and how deeper an unuttered word could run."
"I found this movie to be absolutely delightful. I remember seeing its predecessor, Before Sunrise, about nine years ago when it came out on video and being pleasantly surprised by that little gem of a movie. I was slightly younger than the main characters, Jessie and Celine, but their dreams and the questions they were struggling with at the time resonated very much with my own. When I heard that Before Sunset was being released, I was somewhat hesitant about seeing it, fearing that the follow-up would not measure up to its predecessor or that I would find the characters' conversations to be annoying and sophomoric. But Before Sunset turned out to be even better than Before Sunrise. Though just as idealistic and romantic, there is a stronger current of nostalgia in this follow-up. Celine and Jessie are more aware of their own limitations and of the sacrifices they had to make for their chosen paths in life. They are giddy to be around each other but also fearful about confronting the unrealized possibilities of the relationship they have so deeply idealized. Yes, the movie is very much conversation-driven, and the conversations sometimes veer into the realm of pretentiousnessbut then again, who hasn't come off as slightly pretentious when they are trying to impress someone they really like? I felt a strong compassion for these characters who are smart, idealistic, but flawed in ways that are endearing and human. There is a real urgency in their interactions as they try to make up for lost time. Richard Linklater is a talented director who has genuine interest in and empathy for people who are adjusting to the difficulties and demands of adulthood."
"Ever tried to go back to your first love you met years ago? And later you're involved with someone else, and not very happy? This movie gives the word comfort in a whole new meaning. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke star in the sequel to the movie ""Before Sunrise"". They show the flashbacks of ""Before Sunrise"" and it makes the movie more enjoyable to watch. And Julie Delpy's role of Celine is ""tre magnifique"". She sings, and plays the guitar. This movie can be enjoyed in any language. OOH! LaLa! However, the story has a lot of flashbacks and what the future holds for each. Each one found love after nine years apart, yet neither one is happy. Jesse(Ethan Hawke) is a father, but his marriage to his wife is a total mess, Celine(Julie Delpy) is striking out everywhere in France. Both shared their joys and pains, and they seem to rely on each other when they first met. This movie can be definitely used in French class, and I think it can also used as a learning experience for all. Rating 4 out of 5 stars."
"This can easily be classified as the best ever sequel to an already fantastic movie.The combination of age and constraints are so beautifully inter-played in the subtleties of the actors expressions that you can't help but simply be engrossed completely within the characters.The Rhapsodic delight of the conversation which veers from a little tease to highly sober and back to a tease again embodies the quintessential verisimilitude of life, entrancing the viewer in its very simplicity.Absolutely the best subtle, surreal and surreptitious acting ever. And for all its worth - this movie deserves an all time accolade, for its simply a timeless classic.The director, the crew, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have truly created a momentous masterpiece."
"There isn't anything more that I can say about this masterpiece, deftly given to us (like a perfectly wrapped present) by the ""cerebral threesome"": Hawke, Delpy and Linklater.So much has already been so eloquently said about this film, (particulary the very first two reviews on IMDb) that my verbiage would be redundant. But I just wanted to put some comments down to try to express the way this movie has profoundly affected me. I cannot count how many times I've seen it. And every single time that I do, the ending STILL makes me *gasp*. Sheer perfection. This movie is all about the connection between two extremely passionate, intelligent and visceral people, and NOTHING that has been churned out lately, can even come remotely CLOSE to this archetype of cinematic brilliance. And the ""real time"" aspect, just adds to its perfection.This movie has so much SOUL; perhaps TOO much for those soulless saps in ""movie-land"" to comprehend.It is simply, a masterpiece. 'Nuf said."
