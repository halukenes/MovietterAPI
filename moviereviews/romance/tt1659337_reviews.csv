"Went to an advance screening expecting your usual ""shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself"" sort of feel-good drama. This movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this movie!"
"I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully.Directing wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying.Same thing with the writing. The dialogue is very honest and beautifully well written. It was very fun to quote along with the movie. Not just the writing but the overall tone of the film reminds me a little bit of John Hughes' work. Adapting a epistolary book into a film is incredibly challenging but Mr. Chbosky did a fine job of translating it into a film.The musical score is done by Michael Brook who's also responsible for Into The Wild, another favorite of mine, and he did a very good job. In fact, one of the scores made me cry because of how it emotionally resonated with the scene it was fitting in. The soundtrack is awesome. Along with Mr. Chbosky, Alexandra Patsavas, who's also the music supervisor for The OC, did a great job of picking out the songs and treated it as if it were a mix tape.Logan Lerman, my god, he did a masterful job as Charlie. The character literally jumped out of the book and made its way onto the big screen. Logan's performance blew me away. He did such an amazing job portraying the embodiment of Charlie through his expressions, his emotions, his movements, everything! So perfectly cast. The last 10 minutes of the movie alone is awards worthy because it really shows how talented he really is. I fell in love with his performance. So perfect in every way.Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much.The second standout of the film is Ezra Miller! He plays Patrick, a gay character who's not afraid of who he is and Ezra portrays him amazingly well. I've seen almost all of his work, and he's becoming a great actor who's very rare in the sense that he's brave and daring in contrast to the roles he has previously played. He steals every line and scene he's in, becoming the comic relief. But even so, Patrick has his own personal problem and this is where Ezra Miller proves once again just how great of an actor he is.Everyone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev, who plays Candance aka Charlie's sister, did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice, Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine. The rest of the cast: Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott who play the parents as well as Joan Cusack who plays Charlie's Doctor were all good, despite having little screen time. Melanie Lynskey did a very good job as Aunt Helen. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson is awesome. He's also a standout. Paul Rudd in general is a very likable actor and again, he doesn't have a lot of screen time either but he still manages to play his part memorably. What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect.I love this movie. It's amazing. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a die-hard fan of the book. It has a great script, great cast, it's well directed, awesome soundtrack and undeniable strong performances. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower may not be the most faithful adaptation but the spirit of the story is still there and it does great justice to the book. This is one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen."
"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another story about a simple guy living in a cruel life of high school. The difference is he's not ought to save the day, wants to lose his virginity, seeking to be popular, or revenge on his bullies. The story is about a shy kid who wants to get along with people and can't wait to leave high school. Behind it is the genuine pain and emotion of the characters which makes it more than just another story about teenagers. Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking, charming, and wonderful.Charlie is palpably just another teenage protagonist, but he is not one of those who tries to prove everyone who mistreated him wrong. His goal is to get away from being anti-social and be like anyone else in high school. We may have heard a story like this before, but what makes this one extraordinary is when it mostly depicts the darkest aspects of their lives. Expressing the most heartbreaking truths about these teenagers. Knowing their problems easily makes it reasonable for us to care about them. The romance is rather credibly lovely than a mainstream claptrap. In the joyous moments, it's pretty delightful and plays a quite nostalgic soundtrack.The film gives the actors some nuance. This is probably a good thing for Logan Lerman. He usually plays the simple charming guy in movies. Since he's good at those, he adds some credibility to Charlie. Emma Watson is likable enough as Sam. The best among the three is Ezra Miller. One might hams it up for Patrick, but Miller gave the character a genuinely wonderful personality.The director and author, Stephen Chbosky, didn't try anything else than to bring his book to life. He tells it straightforward on screen with plenty of strong, effective emotions. The cinematography is bright and beautiful enough. The tunnel scene has the best shots. While the soundtrack is too conspicuous, the music score is noticeably melancholic.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, it's a great film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the cliché mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end, it's quite a remarkable film."
"Stephen Chbosky has taken his exceptional novel and made it an extraordinary film. As the opening credit rolled I was impressed with the quality of the cast including Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Kate Walsh, and Dylan McDermott. And to top it off, Joan Cusak is there as well.This is a story of coming of age and coming to terms of a boy entering high school and adulthood. Freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) almost by accident becomes friends with Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). Soon he is hanging out learning about the ins and outs of being a teen. But there is something that is left unsaid, is it about his last best friend or his aunt.Chbosky must have been blessed by John Hughes. Not only capturing this timeless story with every word and sight, the film's soundtrack blows me away. Not many can take a book of such depth and keep the heart and soul of it alive, but it happened here. Go to the theatre and see it. Check out the book and read it. But most of all, Stay Infinite!"
"Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating Q&A with writer/director Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a well-made film can be. A well written script is so refreshing, and an exceptional script can be truly breath-taking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel (a 1999 bestseller), and he left me stunned and enthralled.The popularity of the novel would typically make the film version a disappointment for its fans. Not so this time. Mr. Chbosky remains true to the spirit despite the need to edit for the sake of continuity and brevity. The key characters spring to life thanks to the efforts of four strong performances from young actors: Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson, The Three Muskateers) plays Charlie, Emma Watson (Harry Potter films) is Sam, Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin, City Island) is Patrick, and Mae Whitman (Arrested Development) is Mary Elizabeth.If you have read the book, you know the story ... you know the characters ... you know the themes. If you haven't read the book, I will spoil nothing. The brilliance is recognized only as you get to know these characters and slowly uncover their stories. What we discover is that, regardless of our age, we recognize these characters from our high school days. We know the introverted, observant Charlie who so desperately needs a support system. We surely recognize the attention-starved, lacking in self-esteem Sam who is the epitome of ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". And we all knew a Patrick ... the flamboyant one who sheaths his pain with an over-the-top act of public confidence. What Chbosky does is shine the spotlight on these characters to ensure that we really SEE them this time.The themes reminded me a bit of a darker John Hughes film (that's a compliment). There were also pieces of two other really good films: Stand By Me and Almost Famous. The formative years of a writer determine the depths to which his or her work will reach later in life. Admittedly, the film is substantially autobiographical, so when Mr. Chbosky says it's a personal story, we begin to understand the foundation of his remarkable writing style.""Welcome to the island of misfit toys."" When this line is spoken, we realize that most every high school kid has thought the same thing at some point. These are painful and difficult times and as Mr. Chbosky stated, we should encourage kids to fight through this stage and get on to the next ... then able to find their true self. Clearly, the film made a strong impact on me. My favorite reaction to a movie is profound thought, and this one caused this in waves. The decision to release as PG-13 was wise. There is no excess of profanity or nudity to divert attention from what really matters ... the characters. I can think of no finer compliment to a writer and filmmaker than to cite them as the cause of my internal discussions related to their film. My hope is that you have the same reaction.

"I absolutely loved this film - specifically the acting, music and even at times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of the book and the characters magnificently - Ezra and Logan give exceptional performances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performance as Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character, however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry - she's in Bling Ring next year and will have improved by then, she does a great job of finding her ground and portraying a troubled yet lovable and wonderful teen, at times her actions speak much louder than her words. Logan is phenomenal at every aspect of Charlie - awkward, unsure, emotional, honest - he gives an amazing performance. Ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moment's notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of humour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent soundtrack to back it up."
"Saw this movie at TIFF and after watching the trailer was thinking I was going to enjoy this movie. Those expectations now are so very low, this movie is amazing. It speaks on many different levels of being a teenager, dealing with death, loneliness, and how awkward it can be trying to fit in. I haven't seen a move like this in a very long time and was very refreshing. The highlight of the film for me at least from a acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny, but very heartfelt at the same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing (Emma Watson was perfect for this after HP) but Ezra really stands out. Stephen Chbosky really cared about this book, and it really shows in this film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea. It's going to get many comparisons to a John Hughes film, and rightfully so this movie is heart felt and just amazing. I will definitely being seeing this film again."
"I just saw the movie at the Pgh premiere and it was amazing. I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed because I loved the book so much. The movie is very true to the book. A few things have been omitted or changed but it doesn't change the mood of the story. I think the casting choices were spot on. Emma Watson has a scene in which she tears up and cries and it was amazing. I also appreciate how Chbosky made the parents thoughtful people, unlike most teen comedies. I am definitely going to see this movie again because there was so much to take in. Very well done.It's also lovely to see my hometown as the backdrop. Pgh is a beautiful city and coming out of the Fort Pitt tunnels into the city is an experience that isn't quite captured well enough in the film. It's still a powerful scene and I teared up watching it."
"The Perksas it were, was a bit of a marvel when discussing what teenagers have to contend with. Anyone that decides to see this film expecting a run of the mill high school drama or teenage angst tale will be pleasantly surprised at the depth with which this story delves. This adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's novel seemed to take the difficulties facing one young man embarking on his high school journey through one extreme situation after another. I could visualize a totally different version of this tale of misfit toys being played out where all is right with the world and Charlie (Logan Lerman) is the most popular freshman in school for the simple fact that all his friends are seniors. The immediate infatuation that Charlie had with Sam (Emma Watson) was no surprise, what did surprise me was the challenges that she and her step brother Patrick/Nothing (Ezra Miller) had to endure. Even I started to get annoyed as the school year progressed and the running 'Nothing' joke persisted. It's always surprising when a story focuses on well to do young people whose lives would be expected to mimic a fairytale. This story gives insight into the fact that some young people have the same if not even more struggles than others and having money can't really fix that. I found it interesting that there was no clear indication in the story as to the school year, even at graduation there was none of the typical 'Class of '92' or whatever to show how proud of their time graduates are. It may be that Mr. Chbosky wanted to steer clear of associating the story with a specific year, but it was obviously the early 90's when the primary mode of sharing and exchanging music was via cassette. I recall so very clearly the good old days when the 'mix tape' ruled. I have to say that I liked Emma Watson as an American teenager, she can cross the pond and put it down any time. Yes there were a few moments in her dialog that she sounded like Hermione, but this role did a great deal to paint her in a different and mature light. I am not drawn to tales of the human condition unless there is a deep truth to be gleaned from the story, so if I had to say the moral of the story is It would be 'you gotta have friends'. This story worked because of what the three key characters gained from getting to know each other. I give it a green light."
"I saw the preview of this film and thought it was intriguing. I went to a screening last week and was totally BLOWN AWAY......this film has everything. I grew up in this era were the internet highway was just about to expload and I felt this film had EVERYTHING -great beginning = grabbed your attention, then acceptance, then the complex happened and you just didn't know where this film was going to go and then the film closure or was it? This has to be the BEST DRAMA/LOVE STORY ....coming of age I have seen. I would recommend this film to ANYONE....LOVED IT !!!!!! PLEASE go see this film. I feel due to lack of advertisement that it will be overlooked with other big blockbuster films but I totally related to this film and LOVED IT !!! I haven't even heard about this film until I was invited to a screening...saw the trailer and really wanted to see it but the trailer does not do it justice. If you are looking for something to do on a weekend ...get out of the heat..please see this film"
"Spoiler Alert: There will be some spoilers in this review.I was very fortunate to have finally seen Perks of Being a Wallflower (POBAW) at an advance screening courtesy of a fellow film fanatic and blogger. I had to travel for the most part of a day through a couple of States to get to the screening but it was worth every penny of the toll fees charged.Disclosure: I read POBAW nearly 10 years ago when I was just about to start college and it remains one of my favorite books alongside works by Thomas Pynchon, Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath, John Irving, Gore Vidal - a very eclectic bunch.I had also been tracking any plans to make a film version of the novel since 2008 when Chbosky was quoted in an online interview that he was working on a script based on his novel. I thought that's a very hopeful, positive and at the same time brave sign. Around the time I read the novel, I was also totally engrossed in a new drama series on the WB called ""Jack and Bobby"" which starred a then 12-13 year old actor named Logan Lerman whom I had seen previously in the cult favorite ""The Butterfly Effect"" as a young Ashton Kutcher and the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie ""A Painted House"". I was struck by the maturity of Lerman's weekly output in Jack and Bobby and thought at the time that he reminded me so much of Charlie in POBAW.Fast forward to 2010 when Variety broke the news that Lerman, Chbosky and Emma Watson were all involved in the POBAW film with John Malkovich's Mr. Mudd Productions - I knew then that it was going to be special.And it is. It is a faithful adaptation of the novel to the screen but not necessarily a set piece-for-set piece accurate one. More than the plot elements and details, it is the story arc and the emotions in the written work that have made a successful transition to the screen. For that I must credit Chbosky for knowing what to cut and what to retain in the film version. Even the use of songs other than those in Charlie's mixtape works because the director and the entire team know the essence of the book and how and why it has affected so many readers and they respected it.Spoilers: There is no abortion scene, no reading of Dr. Earl Reum's moving poem in the film or some of the scenes with Charlie's extended family over the holidays and yet, I have to agree wholeheartedly with Chbosky's decision on this. Fans of the book should not get into a twist because some of these will not be seen because Charlie's story and more importantly, his unique voice is there in all it's quirky, lovable and emotional beauty.Don't let the obviously very commercial trailer fool you, the film retains the book's darker moments and the demons which torment the protagonist.As for the acting, I cannot say enough about how the cast embodied and fully embraced the characters they were playing. First off, those who know Logan Lerman only from his Percy Jackon-franchise should take another look at this promising young actor. I have seen Lerman in other performances in 3:10 to Yuma and My One and Only and always found him to be a mature and sensitive actor. And while his performances in those films are noteworthy, Perks allows him to show his full range and versatility. He is Charlie no doubt about it and imbues the role with sophistication and emotion. I realize the Academy doesn't take notice of younger actors unlike the actress categories but Lerman's performance is truly awards-worthy.Ezra Miller's portrayal of Patrick may surprise some fans of the book as his characterization may be slightly more flamboyant than the Nothing of the book but he delivers a funny, outrageous but ultimately warm performance.Now Emma Watson really needs to do more work on her American accent as her natural one flits in and out but it doesn't totally distract from a winsome and winning performance as Sam. Perhaps not in the same league as Lerman and Miller but certainly a departure and breakthrough from just being known as Hermione. The actress knows how to choose material. Also the chemistry between her and Lerman is outstanding.Mae Whitman, Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack, Kate Walsh, Dylan McDermott and the always great Melanie Lynskey also make wonderful contributions. I wish though that we had seen more of the young actor Chbosky cast as Michael (cut out of the film) and Julia Garner of Electrick Children.Just a last note, Chbosky makes full use of his Pittsburgh setting to situate the characters in the film. The Christmas/holiday scenes are beautiful visually and so is the RHPS.If there is one thing I hope fans of POBAW will do is to tell people they know to see the film. This is not your typical teen fare and certainly miles ahead of the Twilight series and the Hunger Games. As a coming-of-age film, I would place this in the same league as ""Dead Poets' Society"" and the classic ""Harold and Maude"". More substantial than John Hughes' work. This is real. I would love it if families could see this film together. It deserves nothing less. I hope that there is enough critical mass at TIFF and beyond to elevate this film for the accolades it deserves."
"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a good movie. However, as a father of two girls in college, watching this film is a bit tough for me, as I WANT to assume that real young people don't do drugs, stand up in fast-moving cars, have sex, or, well...have sex. But I also know this naive and although I would hate for younger teens to see this movie (as it might give them a sense that they should grow up too fast), it IS a good film. Far from perfect,...but a good film.The film is about a very insecure and withdrawn young man entering high school. He doesn't fit in and knows it. However, surprisingly, he does soon get taken into a small group of friends--friends who are seniors and mostly have a lot of hangups too. It takes place over this single year of high school and ends when the older friends go off to college.The film has a very smart script. Sometime, perhaps a bit too smart because too often the kids come off as a bit hipster-ish and too glib. But it is very enjoyable throughout and quite poignant--and deals with some VERY tough and complex topics--some of which are rarely ever addressed. While I don't think the movie is as wonderful as most (since it's in the IMDb Top 250 List), it is quite good and excellent for an audience 16 and up...well, perhaps 17 and up."
"The biggest issue with this movie, I would have to admittedly say, is the fact that is such an underrated film. Not to say anything against Best Picture nominee, Silver Linings Playbooks, but I would myself place an Oscar nomination for The Perks of Being a Wallflower over SLP for a Best Picture nomination. That being said, let the review be underway A young and troubled freshman by the name of Charlie (Logan Lerman) attempts to make his way through high school and gain friends as he falls in love with Sam (Emma Watson) The story is definitely based off Steven Chbosky's novel which he writes and directs in this case. Normally, having the author of a book direct a film can often come out horrible as a reader's interpretation is completely different from a film director's. Also, a book must be structured and paced differently to that of a film and in most cases, an author directing a film would more so attempt to direct it like a film. It's not the case here, thankfully! The direction in this film is definitely marvellous and the way the characters were presented is truly fantastic. Having never read the book myself, I was almost immediately fascinated by the film and a while into the film, I knew I would love it. Despite only reaching a 100 minute run time, I would personally have loved the film to be another half hour longer.The film is a truly moving one and is not an average popcorn flick. Very powerful emotionally, at least for someone like me, who has experienced a similar life to that of Charlie, it can definitely be hard to re-watch this film, despite its complete brilliance.With good performances throughout, from Logan Lerman to Emma Watson, this film adds further credibility. If I were to pick a fault with this film, I'd really have a tough time sitting through thinking but perhaps, if a few characters, mainly Mary and Sam were elaborated a bit more, there may have been a bit more of an emotional connection but for Sam, it doesn't tend to matter much as her character is a likable one and the screen time she has is relatively long.In a year that saw the releases of films like Django Unchained, The Hobbit, Skyfall, The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers and Looper, I myself would personally rank it above all those great films of the year except for my personal favourite Django Unchained.Fantastic direction, excellent writing and an excellent knowledge of book to movie adaptations from the book's very author, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a brilliantly acted story and is emotionally powerful yet displays elements of other films. A fantastic film, a near masterpiece of the decade. One of the most underrated films of this new decade."
"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" redefines the classic American coming-of-age story. Writer/director Steven Chbosky has raised the bar on the traditional adolescent drama, with an emotionally-charged narrative infused with just enough bold strokes of joy and heartbreak to set a new benchmark for what the genre can accomplish.Based on Chbosky's own novel of the same name, the movie is about growing up in a tough and unforgiving world, yes, with its requisite lessons on overcoming obstacles. But it also touches on tragic notions of loss and grief, rarely explored in coming-of-age films with such mastery.Chbosky has said that if viewers take away one message from the film, it's that ""you are not alone."" This seemingly simple thought can't come at a better time, as bullying and its often devastating consequences have dominated headlines in recent months.The book's premise is deceptively straightforward. 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) keeps a diary of letters addressed to someone real or imagined. ""Dear Friend,"" each entry begins, as he recalls his tumultuous high school days, celebratory one moment, heartbreaking the next, but always poignant and full of promise. The movie brings Charlie's writing to life, with a charming cadre of schoolmates (and the occasional peripheral adult) taking the stage as Charlie stands in the spotlight. It's an ideal structure for a narrative as free of boundaries as the promising world of the adolescent. Charlie is everyteen, we've all been there, or have we? The Perks of Being a Wallflower wanders down paths seldom seen on screen, into surprisingly shocking territory that challenges audiences to open their hearts.The indie look and feel of the film is undeniable from the start. Single-point lighting is used effectively as a plot device. Charlie's face often appears split down the center, one side brightly lit, the other in soft shadow, mirroring his conflicted soul and sense of confusion, trapped between two worlds. Light falls gently on him when he's serene, more harshly in moments of crisis. The darkness hides the secrets he deftly keeps to himself as the narrative unfolds.Audiences of all ages will be able to relate to the 80s modern rock soundtrack -- evocative songs you undoubtedly know and love, spanning generations from Boomers to today's teens. Sound design is brilliantly orchestrated with action timed perfectly to the music cues. Michael Brook's original score is appropriately minimal. Nothing needs to be underlined here in a story that has no filler or room to breathe. Not a frame is wasted on extended character development or conventional transitions in this visualization of Charlie's nonstop roller-coaster of a diary.Andrew Dunn's stunning cinematography patiently engages the viewer, eschewing the hand-held shaky cam style so prevalent in the genre. His use of slow motion dolly shots brings us, literally, into Charlie's world. The boy's fear and sense of unease is heightened by intense closeups that reveal the bittersweet emptiness in his eyes. There's a lot more going on in that youthful head than he allows those around him to see, but even he isn't aware of it. We are but voyeurs, watching, examining, trying to make sense of Charlie's vulnerability and confusion.Editor Mary Jo Markey's loving hand allows us to embrace the plot's twists and turns without skipping a beat. The pace is calm but deliberate, and it's clear that Dunn, Markey, and the rest of the production team are as devoted to Chbosky's vision as a boy experiencing his first romance. You only have one chance to get it right.Chbosky has unquestionably assembled one of the most talented young ensemble casts in recent memory. As Charlie's love interest Sam, 22-year-old Emma Watson dominates the screen with the maturity and wisdom that only a polished veteran could bring to the role. Nina Dobrev, Julia Garner, and Mae Whitman are the free-spirited girls who surround Charlie and attempt to bring him to life. Their performances shine with an authenticity that is clearly rooted in passion for the material. On the male side, Johnny Simmons portrays football jock Brad, whose enigmatic personality figures prominently in the story in ways which will be left to the viewer. Nicholas Braun and Reece Thompson are standouts in support and much-needed comic relief.As Charlie's would-be best friend Patrick, Ezra Miller is shockingly brilliant as a gay-go-lucky teen who lives life as if every day is his last. His joie de vivre is infectious and vacuums the pain out of anyone who comes near.But ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" primarily rests on the shoulders of Logan Lerman. As Charlie, his ability to play down to 15 (he was 19 at the time) owes itself to a physical transformation he brings to every role -- in this case, widening his eyes and keeping an expressionless face that projects puppy dog innocence. His posture, walk, and pattern of speech all serve to underscore Charlie's youthful vulnerability. However ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is remembered, wherever it stands in the pantheon of coming-of-age pictures, Lerman's authentic characterization of Chbosky's semi-autobiographical protagonist should stand as one of the most iconic adolescent portrayals of our time.Some films are intensely personal, and that's as it should be. Art should move you, and you bring your own life experience to the table when considering it. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" was so much more than I imagined. I expected to be moved but I had no idea where the film would take me. Whether or not you will be similarly affected is something you'll need to discover for yourself. I think you will."
"This movie takes on the subject of bullying brilliantly. The movies message is not forced upon the viewer. The characters and conversations are so well written that the unsensible with the story and people becomes natural. I really wanted to be a part of their ""strange"" gang and fell particularly in love with Charlie, Sam and Patrick. Maybe not the most cheerful movie, but it will still remain in memory for long"
"Although most reviewers on IMDb seem to be ecstatic about 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', I don't think this film really stands out. To be honest, it didn't really move or impress me in any way. In my opinion it's a decent film, with some flaws, that could have been far better if it wasn't so mainstream. I think most of the enthusiastic reviewers are young people, who recognize themselves in this story about teenagers who choose to be different from the rest. It's a very romantic story: a melancholic teenager befriends a group of progressive/bohemian/intellectual youngsters, who differentiate themselves from the rest of the school. They introduce him to parties, drugs and music from The Smiths and David Bowie. He falls in love with one of the girls, and another girl falls in love with him. There are secrets to keep, memories to share and experiences to cherish. This could have been the cinematographic equal to Donna Tartt's novel 'The Secret History'. But it lacks the dark, mysterious, Gothic aspects of the book. There are traumas and secrets in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', but they are implied and not clearly explained. It's clear this movie appeals to young people, who perhaps can recognize a lot about their own life in the film. But to be a good movie in its own right, it should also be attractive for viewers in other age groups. I think in that respect this movie fails."
"This movie impressed me in a way that I didn't really expect. Unfortunately I haven't read the book but I want to do it as soon as possible. From the first moments when Charlie started to write his letter I felt a strong empathy for him. I recognized myself in his way of seeing life, his fear of the others...and of the whole world actually. He made me remember my own fears from the time when I entered high school. I'm also a ""wallflower"". I'm the one who always keeps quiet, observes and understands facts. Logan Lerman's character made this movie so worth watching for me. I found myself even in his mental illness too, because, after all, it is a symbol of the ""ghosts"" which haunt each of us, the drama that lies behind our appearance. I think every teenager in this world should see this movie! It presents all the forms of anguish, anxiety, queerness and peculiarity that take over us. This story was made to show us that we're not alone! and that we're not some creepy aliens!I'm only 19 but at the end of the movie I felt so very old! It made me want to stop the time and remain there...at that moment when Charlie had finally touched the apogee of this adventure called adolescence!"
This is my first review and its brief. I do not understand the need for lengthy reviews. After watching this four times in six days i felt compelled to give my own ten pence worth. I've never seen a film like this where i have loved all the characters. The cast are brilliant and story moves along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is amazing. I love movies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works on so many levels. I am not usually one for this sort of genre and came close to taking this back before actually watching it. I am so glad i did not. Its going to be a very long time before something tops this. This is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones. If you love movies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is for you.
"Mostly a trite and clichéd high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who befriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman chief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too unbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes romantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing, would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out like a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell, freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among alterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the only flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual character is a bit cliché, but I was happy that they actually weren't afraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it didn't land an R-rating because of it)."
"I kinda wish someone had warned me about this film, and at the same time, kinda happy I had no idea what was coming. If I had known exactly what this film was about, I may have been slightly reticent to go see it by myself, but I think I would have been equally as embarrassed to have seen it with other people.Why? Because five minutes in, the film managed to grab hold of me on an emotional level like no film has done in decades, forcing me to fight against tears tooth and nail right through until the credits began to roll. And I am not exaggerating. Not even remotely. And I just barely won the fight.With that in mind, I'll keep the details to a minimum, but I warn you, if my words move you to see this film, you may want to go in prepared (or wait for the DVD), although little could have prepared me for such a beautifully honest and gut-wrenching film.Charlie is a loner. He had a best friend, but that friend is gone. He's about to start high school, but just doesn't quite fit in anywhere. A brilliant student with a complete lack of social skills. That is, until he finds every ounce of courage he has to speak with Patrick. And suddenly, he is introduced to a world of people kind of like him. People who don't need to question him to understand him.He found a band of wallflowers.I was well-aware that this little indie-ish film had been extremely well-received by critics, and has managed a moderate box office. However, what piqued my interest is the fact that, as Oscar murmurs pick up strength and sail from whispers to rumbles, critics after critic have randomly called this movie out of left field as a film that should up ""for your consideration."" All I could think was, ""Wow, really? A teen movie is THAT good?"" Well, without hesitation, I can say with all honesty that it is really that good. I will go as far to say that it may just be the best film I have seen all year.Much of the Oscar whispers focus on two things: the flawless script by Stephen Chbosky (who adapted the film from his own epistolary 1999 novel of the same name and also directed) and Ezra Miller. After a phenomenal turn as a tormented teen in last year's exquisitely disturbing ""We Need to Talk about Kevin,"" Miller's Patrick is indeed an incredibly memorable young man, playing a teen held back at school with skin that has become so thick, he is not a victim of the torment of his peers, but has instead learned to embrace it. Emma Watson, in her first post-""Harry Potter"" starring role, is stunning as Sam, in terms of both her physicality and her acting, the beautiful young woman who is trying to put her past behind her and find her place in the world. But, in my humble opinion, the bulk of emotional gravitas radiates from the film's rising star, Logan Lerman. As the conflicted, unstable and completely lost Charlie, Lerman's performance is nothing short of revelatory. With every look, awkward touch and utterance from his mouth, he is like Michael Cena stripped of sarcasm and overloaded with brilliance and emotion.And while their screen time ranges from actively supporting to mere minutes, even the secondary roles, played by Paul Rudd as ""that teacher"" that some of us will remember and cherish forever , Kate Walsh (""Private Practice"") and Dylan McDermott (""American Horror Story"") as Charlie's parents, and Mae Whitman (""Parenthood"") as one of the wallflowers, add to the incredible emotional complexity, lending this film such an unobtrusive air of honesty and genuine feeling that to not be deeply moved by the story as it unfolds before you is practically inconceivable.If you have always been the pretty one with the perfect grades or the perfect job, the popularity, and attention focused on you, maybe you won't quite get it. But for the majority of us who have ever spent time wondering where the hell we fit in in this world, whether it be back in high school...or right now...keep the Kleenex close. If this film does not move you to your very foundation, make you think of where you have been, maybe where you are, or worry about what your kids might be silently going through, I don't know what else would.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is such an acutely executed film, it overflows with authenticity thanks to extraordinary performances by an almost implausibly perfect cast of young talent. If the AMPAS voters fail to take notice, it will be a shame, not just because nothing else hit the big screen this year like it and it deserves the extra recognition, but because an entire generation or two (or three) should take notice.Yes, it is THAT good. In a world where we need to assure our younger generation that ""it gets better,"" parents, teachers, wallflowers? Please, take notice. And grab the Kleenex. You've been warned."
"It was a very well made movie, i started watching the Movie & read the book which i finished in 5hrz. i was into it perhaps the movie made me wanna read the book more. It a really interesting way of writing a book. I'd encourage for anyone to read the book & Watch the movie. I thought Emma Watson looked really good, Hot even & I loved Logan here...Ezra was just good, great even.It hurt because i found relations to it, perhaps that's why i cried. that moment when Sam (Emma Watson) touches Charlie's lap (Logan Lerman) with that look in his eyes i knew something was wrong & i cried.Some of the songs are a good pick, some are just Duh!Asleep by The Smiths (Oh Lovely track)Love always JC"
"I went into watching 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' without reading the book 1st so I didn't know what sort of story to expect. The rating of the film was high but I was still a bit skeptical as to whether I would actually enjoy this, I'm glad to say I did like this film. The story is well written and the acting is very impressive. Logan Lerman as Charlie was the main character, he had some problems and he played his role very well, he seemed like a completely believable character who you really feel for. The rest of the cast were also good, especially Emma Watson. Having seen a lot of her in the Harry Potter movies, this was the 1st time I've seen her in anything else. She made the change with ease and her American accent was believable I thought, she really did show just how good of an actress she is. It has a serious side to it and some of the flashbacks are a little uncomfortable to watch. The way the friendships are developing is realistic and quite heartwarming. You really feel attached to the characters and maybe can relate a little to them, they are all extremely likable in their own way. I also liked the soundtrack for the film. Overall it's a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone who wants a good drama. 8/10."
"I usually don't bother reviewing anything at IMDb that's already been reviewed a hundred times, but since the vast majority of reviews here are glowing, I thought I'd offer my two cents.I kind of hated Perks of Being a Wallflower. Why? It was like an angst overdose in a depressing fantasy world. Now I know there exists bullying in high school, but generally high school is not like it is portrayed here. Everyone in high school is not mean to you from the first to the last day and even if jocks can be insensitive, depicting them as nothing but evil bullies is a tired, stale plot mechanism.The main character Charlie is so introverted that we never quite care about him. I'm remembering the introverted character from Almost Famous and how he ended up being really funny and lovable. I really didn't feel anything for Charlie. And both his parents are just robots so we're never given an explanation of why he is the way he is other than his aunt molested him and then died in a car accident. Really? That's what totally screwed up an otherwise normal, intelligent, halfway good looking kid?Patrick is probably the best character but, really, he's a flaming queer and knows every word of the Rocky Horror Picture Show by heart but he has never heard of David Bowie's song Heroes? Really? And he isn't into theater? He just goes to parties and acts flamboyant while he is secretly depressed? Yet he and the rest of the ""wallflowers"" probably have more friends than any of the so-called ""cool"" kids do, so what are they so depressed about?The teacher Mr. Anderson is a minor, minor character yet supposedly he has a great impact on Charlie's life. Why? Because he gives him books? There seemed to be some homo-erotic thing going on there that's never touched upon. Perhaps a moment a bit more awkward than the hug Charlie gives him--that might have shed some light on their mysterious relationship.Charlie's high school crush Sam is an okay character but she also just sort of goes along with the absence of plot. She tells Charlie that she loves him but then she acts totally surprised when Charlie kisses her during the game of truth or dare. Really? And then later she's in love with him again or something. Whatever.And of course there's Brad (no, can't be a reference to Rocky Horror, can it) the football star who is having a secret love affair with Patrick, a love affair that's so obvious that the only ones who can't see it are all Brad's knuckle-headed jock friends who don't even question him even when Patrick practically announces it in the cafeteria.And where are the rest of the freshman, and the sophomores, and the juniors. This schools seems to have one freshman, Charlie, and everyone else is a senior. It makes NO sense.I kept looking at the time realizing I still had forty five minutes, a half hour, twenty minutes to go, wanting to puke from eating so much angst, until I finally was shouting out loud ""It's David Bowie's song Heroes, good God, it's not exactly obscure!!!!"""
"The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) High school freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) is having problems making friends but that all changes when he meets Sam (Emma Watson), Patrick (Ezra Miller) and their group. Soon Charlie finds himself experiencing all sorts of new adventures but the past is still there to haunt him as he tries to make sense of his world. This is based on Stephen Chbosky's best-selling novel and it's a rare case where the writer also gets to not only do the film's screenplay but also direct. I will admit right up front that I've never read the book and I never even heard of it until I saw the trailer for this movie. After viewing this film it really makes me want to read it because as a film this thing is actually very touching and rings very true to life. I thought the three leading characters were some of the best written and most memorable to come out of a teen film in a very long time and thankfully the screenplay pays just as much attention to the supporting characters like their friends to even Charlie's parents. The screenplay here is certainly one of the best of the year and I really liked how it could be dramatic one moment, sad the next and then funny all in the matter of seconds. I think this is why it rings true to real life and it also doesn't help that you get so many memorable performances. The three leads are certainly terrific with Watson coming off the best as the charmer. A lot of credit also has to go to Lerman for being able to handle such a wide range of emotions. Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, Kate Walsh and Joan Cusack all do great in their smaller roles as well. Horror fans will also get a kick out of seeing Tom Savini in his role as a shop teacher. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is certainly a clever, smart and well rounded picture that works on many levels. I can't say if it's better or worse than the book since I haven't read it but this film is clearly a winner."
"Frankly I didn't expect too much from this entry; I've never heard of the book let alone read it, I'm not really a Harry Potter buff so I had no interest in whether or not Emma Watson would not out to have discovered Life Beyond Harry Potter. At most I was hoping for a painlessly pleasant couple of hours in the dark. Having seen it I have no problem endorsing the positive reviews I have just been reading here on IMDb. Whilst I don't know how realistic it would be to have a freshman hanging out with Seniors for one whole Academic year the thought merely registered rather than nagged throughout the running time. There was one subtle touch I appreciated: Charley establishes an immediate rapport with his English teacher who is happy to suggest - and even supply - 'extra' reading for Charley, who laps it up. At one point the teacher makes Charley a present of his own 'personal' copy of 'The Catcher In The Rye'. This novel is narrated by a troubled teenager who reveals in the last chapter that he is writing from a hospital where he is being treated for a nervous breakdown; 'Wallflower' is also narrated by Charley who begins by telling us he has spent some time in hospital and we soon realize this his ailment wasn't physical. Nice touch. This is very much an ensemble piece, to say nothing of a labor of love, and it would be churlish to single out any one performance. My only reservation is that, like so many 'indie' movies that are so charming on a first viewing - Sideways, The Station Agent, Juno, etc - it may not hold up in a few years time. But for now it is slightly terrific."
"I'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it all before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded for it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve it. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set in a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is never stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it tries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters. Joan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY end of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend most of the time thinking ""I thought Joan Cussack was in this?"" But I guess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan Cussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh, and wasn't alive in 1990."
"I never read the book this film is based on. It was never on my radar to watch. It wasn't a film I was even planning to see. And guess what? It turned out to be a gem of high proportions.Now, the cast here is all wonderful, and the three leads all work perfectly. Miller and Watson are great, and the former has some really great scenes that would definitely put him in my Supporting Actor line- up. But the real star here is Logan Lerman. I don't have any say on how he portrayed the character in the novel, but what he did here amazed me to no end. His ability to reflect so many of his characters' past with such simple glances is incredible. It would have been so easy to make the silent-type lead teenage boy feel lazy or uninspired, and even in a lessor actor's hands it could have felt that way. But Lerman is mesmerizing from start to finish, never once hitting a false note or detaching himself from the emotional weight his character is living under. This is one of the best teenage performances I've ever seen, and as of right now easily the best performance of the year. Granted, I haven't seen most of the awards contenders, but this is truly incredible stuff and Lerman has enormous talent that I really hope carries him through a long and successful career. These kinds of films are always hard to navigate exactly. It's kind of hard to not fall into clichés or stereotypes. At first glance it seems like there's nothing that makes this stand apart from other films of this kind. Granted, I don't watch many that are under this specific genre simply because they never seem like anything out of the ordinary. So to be as moved by the film as I was, for it to have emotionally touched me the way it did is a huge surprise. Technically this isn't some high achievement, but there is no other film as emotionally rich this year. The characters and story lines all work in marvelous ways. I can't even say that some of it wasn't familiar territory because most of it verges on what we have seen before. And it's not perfect, some of the dialogue at times is a bit clunky, some of the plot mechanics. But it all comes together to create what is to me, a deeply, deeply personal film. I connected with the characters in ways I forgot were possible. There have been many great films in recent years, but I don't think there's been one that has reminded me of who I am as a person or who I was, what my life has been like, what life in general is like, this much. I always dread sentimentality, and if anything I am easily put off by any kind of emotional manipulation. But this is the only film in a long time that really was trying to be as emotionally investing as it could be, and one that never hit any real false notes when it came to the emotions it stirred in me. I've always said that as great as any story lines or characters are in observing a film you've seen, the art of film is ultimately a medium of feeling, just like any other art form. And this is why I haven't mentioned, really, any of the plot. Being able to talk about how it made me feel is enough, and this is a film where the emphasis on the word ""feel"" is all but deserved. This is a small gem of a film, but as rich of an experience as one could hope for. The best film of 2012."
"American high-school movies. Yes another one. In tackling the pitfalls and plateaus of adolescence, many films have fallen along the bad side of cliché, however it's important to remember that like every genre (well, nearly) it has had its successes; for me, John Hughes seminal The Breakfast Club instantly springs to mind, along with others such as Pretty in Pink, Mean Girls and Clueless. Fortunately, The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes a decent stab at falling into the same category as these films; and while it doesn't scale to their heights, it's a surprisingly likable coming-of-age drama.Based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 bestseller on the same name (he also writes and directs here), the film concerns freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) as he experiences difficulty at home and school. However, he falls in with a group of seniors, including Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), who show him what is to be a ""wallflower"". He encounters depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, homophobia, love, heartbreak, David Bowie and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.I was sincerely taken aback by the fact that Charlie did not annoy me; too many high-school films and TV shows nowadays centre of smart- mouthed, wiser-than-their years teens, so it was refreshing to have one relatable and natural. This is mainly due to Lerman who delivers a sincere and engaging performance. While Emma Watson shows clear evidence of a career beyond Potter. However, it's Miller who's the standout; after holding his own with the brilliant Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin, he doesn't disappoint, despite being saddled with the 'flamboyant gay best friend' role.Chbosky's direction is nothing to marvel at and the script not one of the year's best, but overall, to quote South Park's Deapartment of Interior Security Guy, it's ""fine, just fine"". A sweet, enjoyable and honest look at those years we'll never forget."
I think I deserve to dance with Emma Watson and Ezra Miller.
"A movie that I can start at any point in my life, as long as there's a point to be made. I have gotten to the annoying point where I know the lines before they happen, but I usually have the respect to only whisper them to myself. This movie swallows up what it feels like to be in high school and spits it into a mirror. When being nothing feels like everything. When you thought there was no one cool left to meet. And in some time where you haven't heard the best David Bowie song ever. The time in life where there are no answers, but if you're lucky, the questions at least become more interesting. And we are all infinite."
"In this film, Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is an outsider who is coping with the suicide of his best friend, as well as with his own mental illness. He struggles to find friends, but soon finds them in Sam, played by Emma Watson, and Patrick, played by Ezra Miller. He is particularly smitten with Sam and they go on adventures, showing him what it's like to be a teenager.This is such a beautiful film. It really is one of the greatest young adult films ever, and it's all sold in the main three actors' performances. Logan Lerman is perfect as the guy who nobody notices at a party, while Ezra Miller is great at playing the wild and unusual character. The one who really surprised me, though, was Emma Watson as Sam. It was going to be hard for her to come out of the shadows as Hermione Grainger, but she does it so effortlessly that I think that, although it will be her most famous role, she doesn't seem to have any problems branching out and trying new things.What really got to me more than anything was the characters themselves. You really cared about these guys. You wanted them to just be there for each other through thick and thin, no matter what the cost was. This is a beautiful film about friendship and I just can't say enough about it. Go and watch it. You'll know what I'm talking about."
"Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman) is a loner high school freshman with dark secrets. Luckily, unusual seniors Sam (Emma Watson) and her gay stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) adopt him into their circle of friends. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) takes a liking to him and English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) takes an interest in his work.The group of friends have amazing chemistry. They give a sense of true friendship off-camera, and it shows on camera. The only minor observation is that Logan Lerman seems a little too old to play a High School freshman. He is suppose to be 3 years younger than the rest. Logan Lerman gives a great performance but sometimes it's harder to see him as that much younger. Emma Watson also gives a credible performance as a sweetheart, but she's missing the damaged core that the story implies. Ezra Miller has wonderful charisma.First time director Stephen Chbosky adapts his own book to the big screen. He does a surprisingly good job for a rookie. But at times, he seems to miss the big moments. Charlie suffers from blackouts, and sometimes the movie suffers from the same. Songs often ends abruptly, and some scenes are missing its big payoffs. There's a scene where the boys grab him into the bathroom, but he doesn't show any consequences. I get the sense that a more experienced director would be able to see the missing bits. Charlie goes nuts in a fight but the movie holds back the big money shots. The movie has really dark places to go. The tone starts off as a charming, cute coming of age movie. I think a brutal scene early on would set the movie off in a darker direction. If it wants to go there, it needs to start earlier. Overall, it's a heart breaker and a good effort for the first time director. The young cast gives an exceptional performance."
"I wanted to like this movie. I read the book about a decade ago, while in my late teens, and the story resonated with me on several levels. I have been hoping (and praying as much as an atheist can pray) that the Hollydood commerce machine would not screw it up. Alas, in vain.I am struggling of what to describe first in this review, but I think that I will give the makers of this movie a little credit. ""Perks"" was always going to be a difficult story to televise and the attempt is not a total cop-out. The movie stays true to the book in many respects and it's obvious that there was some thought put into capturing the feel of the written tale. That it didn't succeed is a confluence of several factors.The main problem is down to the casting and portrayal of the main characters. I have no issue with the protagonist, Charlie, but the roles of Patrick (Ezra Miller) and especially Sam (Emma Watson) have been rather absurdly twisted, albeit each in a different way.Patrick is overtly and flamboyantly homosexual, which becomes a real distraction. In the book, he was just a cool and funny guy for whom sexual orientation was a nuisance with which he struggled, but he didn't seem to consider it a core of his persona. The movie falls way short of that level of subtlety. Here Patrick is oozing gayness - that's where he begins and that's where he ends.The character of Sam is even worse. I am not sure what is the big deal about Emma Watson. She has very little in terms of acting chops and it's a shame that she keeps getting roles, on the strength of ""Potter"" fame, that she is totally ill-suited for. She lacks any kind of charm and on top of that she looks androgynous. Sam is supposed to be a slutty girl gone good who is still feminine and unwittingly seductive. Emma looks and acts like a preteen boy making it hard to understand Charlie's infatuation with her.The last problem that I want to touch upon is the lack of flow in the narrative. There is just no feeling of cohesiveness that characterizes good movies. It's a succession of short vignettes, loosely related, and strung together. The book also makes frequent jumps in time, but they are easier to digest due to transitional material. It makes sense that there is a time lapse when Charlie starts writing his letter, but somehow that doesn't translate well to the screen.Overall, I give this movie a 4/10 score as I consider it a slightly sub-par effort. It wasn't for a lack of trying, but I wish that the creators resisted the urge to capitalize on Emma Watson's supposed star power and instead found an actress well suited for the role."
"I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. I must confess upfront that I find this film superfluous, given the overload of TV series and films that also center around high schools and their population. One might falsely think that striving to be popular and ""cool"" is the main occupation of an average adolescent. This film adds nothing new or original to this overload, and does not even attempt to show that there is more to the subject. Further, this film concentrates too much on a single person, the alleged ""wallflower"", and leaves the remaining persons very much as entourage.What hinders me in the scenario is that our main character can only be considered a wallflower for a relatively small time frame. He gets some friends in an early stage of the story, albeit all these are older than he is. What helped in acquiring these friendships is that he could show several talents in the context of prose and poetry, and that he also had some talents as a stand-up comedian (probably only when under influence, but still).I scored a 1 (lowest) for the audience award when leaving the theater. I am at a loss why this film ended on place 8 for this award, with an average score of 4.52 (out of 5). I can only assume that other people find interesting material in these stories, which theory seems confirmed by the scores on IMDb. Maybe I'm just too old (64) for this."
"Where to begin? It didn't make sense. It didn't have laughs. It didn't make it clear which period it was set in. It didn't have character development - it merely had characters to whom things happened. It didn't have any understanding of the drug culture. Or the music culture. Or the technology of the day - whichever day it really is set in. OK, it must be the 80s, 90s because of the cassettes. But as a group they dressed so unlike any teenagers I have ever seen anywhere. And they don't know Bowie? Old music aficionados? It didn't make sense.The school. It didn't ring true. All the pupils were stock characters. Don't get me started on the gay jock storyline. Cartoon land. As was the fight scene. As was much of the film. A few tender moments, but mostly stuff we've seen a hundred times before. The acting was fine. Patrick's character annoyed me though. He seemed to have no depth, whereas Charlie was all depth for a very clichéd reason. I am still none the wiser as to why he wasn't sorted out at his first trip to hospital before the film began. You mean the psych doctors didn't probe far enough first time around? And once he lets it all out to his new smiling psychiatrist, he is instantly cured? Freud still lives? Oh please...It didn't make sense. And what were the perks of being a wallflower anyway? Free pot brownies? Besides he wasn't a wallflower for about 95% of the movie. Oh, so the whole clique were wallflowers, misfits, outsiders? No they weren't. They were just like everyone else with around three good friends each, but in their case, dubious taste in music. I mean Eileen and Heroes? OK, I like Heroes, but so inappropriate for a bunch of youngsters seriously into retro. They think Something by the Beatles is 'out there'? Embarrassing musical clichés at every turn.Emma Watson, you need to choose better directors and scripts or you'll end up glossed over. Take a leaf out of Jennifer Lawrence's playbook is my advice. Not sure why some here took her acting to task. She delivered. But with the lines she was given I shouldn't be surprised some didn't like her.This film is a sorry mess that I was expecting much more from. I found myself finding fault with almost every scene. Don't like doing that. Perhaps it might work for kids who have had little movie experience, but wouldn't the music put them off? Why the high IMDb rating? It's a mystery to me."
"This may be somewhat disjointed, but there are significant problems with this film.First off, I love how Emma Watson looks, but she is not organic. Her line delivery is terrible. How are we supposed to buy a 17 year old saying ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys""--really? She loses her accent only somewhat, and moves her head before every single line. And shows a complete lack of inhibition at all times, whereas Patrick and Charlie still have some moments of varied emotion. And if she's the second most important character, where is the depth of storyline and evidence of ""I'm a messed up kid"". She mentions that she had older gentleman boyfriends at 11 and got drunk in freshman year and was promiscuous. Then all of that totally disappears and she acts like a normal person throughout the film. Her other emotional opportunity is ""he said I was right to have broken up with him"". There is no anger or revenge shown, just a matter of fact thing statement. Emma Watson still has a lot of development to do.Patrick was great, range of emotions was believable, his acting was brilliant, and his reactions were on cue. No qualms with him.Problems: Why does everyone think Charlie is a great writer if he never really a) tells them, b) shows them, or c) demonstrates. He hands some essays to his English teacher and then they have this huge connection due to Charlie liking him and his teacher giving him books and only saying ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". So that makes him the best teacher ever and it also makes Charlie a great writer-though he never attempts a novel. The father and mother have about three lines, and in the book the Dad was a lot more stand-offish. You can't prove a father stand-offish if he's just not in a lot of shots. The mother has less lines than the repeated lines of Aunt Helen.Charlie. Great acting, but there's a huge problem with the way the film is developed and how his role comes about. They only mention ""It is getting bad"" and then keep it vague. Who the hell says things like ""it's getting bad"" and then are you seeing things again. There is barely any mention of his stay in a hospital during middle school, and tell me what teenager with light suicidality stays in a hospital for a year? Or even 3 months after his ""breakdown"". Even if it's supposed to be in the '80s that seems off.Mary Elizabeth is apparently a punk rock Buddhist, and then all of the sudden she calls at all hours of the day when they go out--does not seem consistent with her character.Charlie--you're saying that a guy who doesn't work out has the ability to black out and beat up three football players, and that the football players are suddenly stunned and decide to just look stunned rather than fighting back? Really?Then someone thinks it's a good idea for Charlie to have a pot brownie without telling him and he doesn't freak out? And of course they toast him. And there is no detail about his ""friend"" he writes to or his friendship with his best friend who just commit suicide. But about the pot brownie. He is completely fine, then decides voluntarily in the same month or two to try LSD, having never actually smoked. Who does that? Not to mention the absolute lack of supervision throughout the entire film. These kids are allowed to do whatever they want and have house parties seemingly every week with alcohol and drugs, and only once are almost caught (sadie Hawkins). Again, what teenager decides to do LSD after ingesting a pot brownie once, unknowingly?Then there's the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The QB is fine to be in the crowd of people, but cannot be in the show itself because someone would see him. What? And how the hell do all these 17 and 18 year olds all have the leads to this production. You're telling me that anyone who had been at this theater for this production had decided to give up the reins to acting in RHPS to this band of teenagers who apparently know everything about it? And that Charlie has no memories of his Aunt when he's touching breasts of Sam in the show and Mary Elizabeth, but then suddenly has a revelation when Sam's hand slides to his nether regions?And Sam is totally okay with them going to have sex as soon as Charlie says I wanted to ask her out, knowing Charlie? What happens at that point?This film is absolutely illogical and does terrible justice to the book. Emma Watson is gorgeous but unconvincing, Logan could be good in the future, and Ezra has a brilliant career in front of him. But for god's sake, this is not a good movie."
"Has there ever been a moment in life when you look back at your high school life and reminisce on old memories whether they were good, bad, or embarrassing? I know I have. I guess that's how I felt this way about trying to survive high school and to find our hopes and dreams about who we'll be when we grow up, much like Charlie in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". I recently read the book and I can definitely relate to most of the situations that Charlie went through as well as anyone who has read it and seeing that the film has come to life thanks to Stephen Chbosky (the author of the book, as well the screenwriter and director), he discovers the human heart, the first chances you have in life and a chance to break away from all the pain, whether if you're an outcast or a popular kid. Set in Pittsburgh in the early 90's, both the movie and the book does follow Charlie (Logan Lerman), a 15-year-old kid starting high school for the first time. He is terrified about it after the loss of his two favorite people years ago and before high school started. Feeling lonely, depressed and ostracized by his peers in high school, he makes friends with Patrick (We Need to Talk About Kevin's Ezra Miller), the gay wild child and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson, in her first major role outside the Harry Potter series) who welcomes Charlie into ""The Island of Misfit Toys"" and tells him that it's okay to be himself. As the movie goes on as well as the book, Charlie happens to write to his unnamed friend about his first experiences while hanging with his new friends, having a crush on a certain someone, getting some help from his English teacher, Bill (Paul Rudd) and gaining some perspective from his family, including his sister Candace (Nina Dobrev). But he has a dark secret that could possibly haunt him forever. It's amazing to me that ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is one of those rare movies that gets the tone, feel and look right. Chbosky does a great job of streamlining his 213-page book into a 103-minute movie, editing out certain moments but remains faithful to the story. And if you're a true fan of the book, some of the moments from Charlie's point of view, including the tunnel and Rocky Horror scenes are beautifully re-created on screen. And if you love the music in the book, one of the songs from the book (""Asleep"" by The Smiths) is actually in the movie, so, find a chance to listen closely when you see it. The performances in the movie are amazing. They felt very real to me. If you look at this movie and tell us that the performances are not real to you, you need to have your head examined. These would be people I would've loved to hang out with in high school. Lerman is remarkable as Charlie, experiencing a lot of joy and emotions in many ways, including a heartbreaking scene that's reminiscent of Timothy Hutton in ""Ordinary People"". Miller steals every scene he's in and he brings humor and heart to a kid who likes being who he is, but has a few wounds that needs to be healed. And for Emma Watson? Oh, yeah, she captures Sam beautifully in a way that people will understand that she is no longer Hermione Granger. She also carries a very good American accent and it's an incredible performance. This is one of the best films I've seen so far this year. It's a high-spirited drama that's funny as hell, enchanting, heartwrenching and breathtaking. Not to mention that it carries a lot of reality of what high school life is like and how you can just live in the moment when you get a chance. It captures all of that brilliantly. See it to believe it and spread the word, this is a movie that you won't forget. Prepare yourself for unwavering emotions, hilarious humor and a chance of finding hope with ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", a true American teenage classic."
"This should be a drama about young people lost in loneliness, their roles as outsiders & how they handle their difficult situation. But it turns out that the movie is actually about some spoiled kids born into wealth, feeling absolutely confident & comfortable in their dandy-role, doing cool stuff all the time, partying hard & even win the hearts of the ones they want to. I expected a little bit more than a 90min story without ANY problems & aggravated circumstances. The story has no climax & no turning point at all which makes it absolutely redundant telling it in movie-length. you might get bored after 30min, expecting a sweeping change in their lives & relationships but you are definitely disappointed after 90min when nothing of that happened. I have to ask: where is the drama & why these kids have no problems to speak about? American drama? American irrelevance."
While this film might not be for everyone I think it's great for the time that we are in. For me the film excellently portrays a story about being socially disconnected. It touched me because I can relate and I'm sure (especially based on other reviews) that is has touched a lot of other people as well. Acting was very good if not great. Emma Watson clearly has potential and put in a good shift. Ezriel Miller was the standout in my opinion and adds more depth to the film with his character contributing so the overall story line and message of the film.Definitely a must watch film for anyone looking to see a good storyline and take a break from all the big budget movies.
"This film is about a shy high school misfit who becomes a cool guy after two seniors taking him under their wings.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" tells a story of a shy guy who blossoms socially as he develops friendships with two step-siblings. It involves the typical American high school life; with experimentation in sex and drugs, experiences with dating, fights and bullying. I can see how a lot of people can identify with the characters and events in the film, and hence ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" gets such a high rating. However, I think it is overrated. I thought it was a plain coming of age drama. It doesn't push that many boundaries, and there is nothing new. The story is not particularly captivating, and in fact the subtle subplots (involving flashbacks) can be confusing. My friends and I did not agree with the positive critics and the high ratings."
"I viewed this film as something I've seen before. I'd go so far that I thought it was more something very typical for these kinds of movies and it was also very overstated. When this should be a character driven film, it's plot is way too controlling. We're hanging out with a smart, but introvert guy who has problems with something that was done to him, rather than something he has done. Nothing is his fault, even tho he feels that way. The protagonist is a thoroughly nice person, but haunted by a gruesome past that ultimately will strike him in what is the climax of the film.The film is, however, not about his head. It's about the cool, alternative, smart, pretty and older group of people he starts hanging out with. (And these are not the popular kids? Wow, why?) Even tho the members of this group are all very bright in theory, this does not reflect on their choices within the film's plot. Sam is having a relationship with an all-through asshole and it's very obvious that he has a lower level of intelligence as well. Sam then goes on about how she loves Charlie and kisses him. But wait, she doesn't leave the asshole. Why the F not?Charlie is then persuaded into a relationship with Mary Elizabeth, supposedly a Harvard candidate, who is also ignorant to seeing Charlies real desires to want Sam. (Does this group of friends even talk to each other?) They become mad at Charlie when he reaches into these desires during a dare. The group becomes mad at him because he has now hurt both Mary Elizabeth and Sam for desperately showing this. He's suddenly the asshole. Charlie now feels that his is his fault. He becomes, for a very brief period, cast out of this group until he hits (this bit is unclear even in the film) a person and is suddenly a hero again. This leaves me with the impression that the film's 45 minutes to 1 hr 15 minutes are just time extending plot material. It does not in any way, provoke the climax of the film or lead up to it. Conflicts in this time area of the film are quickly started and solved. It's overstated, annoying and boring. I pounded my head a lot to my desk during these minutes.I like the ending, because it is much more intriguing than the overstated personal dramas of this overly cool but not popular group of people we follow. If the film had been more about Charlie's head, displaying more of his inner conflict surrounding his past and his feelings towards his 1000 days left of college, I would think this film is great. But a lot of the plot is only to please the youthful audience and to feed them with a film that appears alternative but is really just a remix of the old. (Much like Easy-A and it's ''self-reflective'' script discourse). But I mean, if you're fourteen you'd not only love this film, but maybe also find it intriguing to display yourself through the identity of the characters. Emma Watson is hot, she has 3 of my 4 stars."
"First world problems of rich suburban kids: The Movie. Or basically, a feature-length episode of Degrassi.This movie is filled with such whiny, pretentious, self-righteous, self-pity wallowing, predictable, teenage melodrama, that is so falsely attributed to be 'deep' and 'on point' that it's just plain hard to take seriously in any stretch of the word. It's also an enigma; it's a film that many teenagers pretend to identify with, even though its view of typical teenage American life is so hollow, vacuous and falsified...not to mention, very exploitative of real insecurities that teenagers feel, which are only used as superficial character 'defining' traits, never to be elaborated on, to gain audience sympathy. It also only touches on teenagers that live in wealthy suburban areas, making for a very narrow field of their target demographic to represent. It comes across as so insincere and manipulative that it's actually rather infuriating and insufferable."
"Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a shy teenager without friends that has just joined the high-school. He misses his best friend, who had committed suicide, and he writes letters to an imaginary friend telling his feelings. Further, Charlie has a mental illness problem in his past. Soon Charlie befriends the veterans Patrick (Ezra Miller), who is gay, and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson) and they become best friends. Charlie wants to be a writer and he also becomes the favorite student of his teacher of literature, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), who lends him books.Sam and Patrick introduce Charlie to their friends and Charlie falls in love with Sam, but he does not have self-confidence to tell her. Charlie discovers a new world and feels happy with his friends,and he dates their common friend Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman). But when they end their relationship, Patrick asks Charlie to stay away from them for a while and soon he triggers his mental illness again. He goes to the hospital where a doctor finally discloses the origin of his problem.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a feel-good drama with a coming-of- age story of a teenager discovering his place in the world. The plot is not a conventional teen movie and Charlie, performed by the promising Logan Lerman, is a complex and timid teenager with traumatic past of sexual abuse and mental illness that finds love, friendship, sexuality, rejection and drugs while growing up. The young actors and actresses have great performances and Emma Watson is lovely and proves that can really act without the label of Hermione. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""As Vantagens de Ser Invisível"" (""The Advantages of Being Invisible"")"
"This film is so awful I felt compelled to write my first review on IMDb. How this film has attained an 8.2 rating is beyond me. The writing is clichéd to the extreme, the acting wooden and unbelievable.I'm sure the film isn't aimed at my demographic (male 40's) and more likely at teenage girls, but there are many coming of age films that do it so much better. Think of American Graffiti (7.5), Breakfast Club (7.9), Submarine (7.3), Fish Tank (7.3), Juno (7.7), La Haine (8.1) etc. How can this piece of garbage be better than any of these and a hundred more?If you want to watch a great coming of age film then give this a wide berth and watch a real movie."
"As someone over 21, I feel like an interloper reviewing this film. It didn't reflect my teenage experience back to me, but I was well past that phase in the early nineties. And yet, the American high school, such a tired, over-familiar arena for American cinema, seems not to have moved on at all. Jocks, Jewish-American princesses, closet gays and geeks all populate this film in fairly conventional representations. The lead character is in a state of fragile mental health, but no Holden Caulfield. He finds friends, has a loving family, and a teacher who looks out for him. The main issue he has is historical abuse, but the rendering of this is so 'lite' as to be unrealistic and totally lacking in emotional impact. I can buy that they did not know a Bowie classic in this part of the world in the early nineties, but I can't accept that they would ostracise a clearly fragile friend after one drunken party faux pas. The film does not explore the fallout of childhood abuse in meaningful terms, and it fails to capture the pain and euphoria of being a teenager. All in all, a bit flat and disappointing."
"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is definitely a movie that almost every teen and adult can relate to. It can bring back the beloved and nostalgic teen-hood memories of an adult, and while at the same time, showing a realistic tale of the every-day life of a teenager in high school to those who can understand the hardships of being a teen. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. Logan Lerman, from ""Percy Jackson"" fame, delivers one of this year's most fantastic performances as Charlie, a shy and nervous young teen, with dreams of being a writer, while not having the greatest childhood, who's about to start his first day of high school. He sees himself as an outcast from the other kids, and he's afraid to make any friends, until he meets and befriends two seniors, Sam and Patrick, played respectively by Emma Watson of ""Harry Potter"" fame, and Ezra Miller of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" fame. They accept Charlie as one of their own, and ask him to join their group of ""misfit toys"". We now get a heartwarming tale of teen-hood, friendship, surviving through high school, living your life, and growing up in this wonderful coming-of-age teen drama. Based on a critically acclaimed novel of the same name, the book's author, Stephen Chbosky, has both written and directed a film adaptation of his own novel, and it just pulls off beautifully. You can tell that all the hard work has to be credited towards the director. It was his responsibility that the movie just has a great look and style, and it has a great realistic tone, while it never falls to being dull. Delivering one of the best scripts in recent memory, this movie is just filled with clever and witty dialouge, while at the same time, giving the audience some intense realistic moments, some that can make you laugh, or some that can make you cry. Thanks to the hard work of the writer, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" never feels as just a simple movie, while rather feels more like a realistic and truthful portrayal of teen life and behavior. As for the performances, all three young actors: Lerman, Watson, and Miller all delivering a fantastic chemistry that just shines on screen, and each actor delivers a great performance one after the other. The gorgeous Emma Watson is great playing the down-to-earth character of Sam, while Ezra Miller delivers stand-out comic relief as Patrick, the incredibly neurotic and charismatic step-brother to Sam. But, it's Logan Lerman who deserves a Best Actor nomination, for his performance as Charlie. As we learn in the film, he hasn't had a great childhood, from not communicating a lot with his family, and still trying to go through the death of a close relative. That makes Charlie seem the ultimate outcast at school. We actually feel the pain and hardships that the character goes through, and we as the audience, are always on his side, supporting him through the stages of his teen life. It's a golden performance that is truly one of the best I've seen all year. The unstoppable supporting cast also features some minor, but great performances from Paul Rudd as the English teacher with a heart of gold, and Melanie Lynskey, seen in flashbacks, as Charlie's deceased relative. This is a film that everybody, in almost every age, from adolescence to adult-hood, can find something to relate to. This is a film that will show audiences a beautiful coming-of-age tale of being yourself, staying with your friends, and trying to live in the world around us. Seeming perfectly similar to a John Hughes film, from ""The Breakfast Club"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a truly original and realistic teen flick that audiences all over will enjoy for sure! ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", in my review, ""A beautifully original, and truly remarkable coming-of-age tale of adolescence""."
"I originally heard about the existence of ""Perks"" from news articles stating that Emma Watson would be in the movie (I'm a huge Harry Potter fan!) I read some of the book summaries and thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to read the book. I absolutely fell in love with it! Ever since, I had been wanting to see the movie, and had been upset at finding out it wasn't coming out near me in September. Finally, this past Friday it came out by me, so on Saturday a couple friends and I went to go see it. Overall, it was an incredible movie. They did leave out certain aspects from the book, but they were mostly parts that I could take or leave anyway. They kept the main parts in, as well as all of the best lines, which I greatly appreciated. The ending almost made me cry; it's just so powerful seeing these things I've read about come to life. Logan, Emma, and Ezra were amazing, as well as the supporting cast. Emma's accent was somewhat detectable in certain parts, but even so she portrayed Sam so well. And Ezra was by far the perfect Patrick, flamboyant, loud, and proud of it. Logan put so much emotion and heart into Charlie that I just wanted to reach through the screen and hug him. He truly was great. Anyone who loves the book as much as me will not be disappointed with the movie. In fact, if you're like me, you will want to see it again the second the credits roll! I know one thing's for sure, as soon as ""Perks"" comes on DVD, this girl is snatching a copy quicker than you can say ""Slut and the Falcon""!"
"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" will be a relevant book for a long time, and consequently there's nothing dated about Stephen Chbosky's unique coming-of-age story now that it has finally hit the big screen so many years later. Anchored by strong performances from its leads and a powerful sense of poignancy, ""Wallflower"" is a thoroughly meaningful and enjoyable film.To come clean I've never read the book, but when an author tackles his own work as both writer and director, it can sometimes spell disaster. When adapting their own work, the creators of original source material either fail or succeed beautifully; either they can't do what needs to be done to their baby in order to make it suitable for film or they completely understand how to translate their work. Chbosky appears to have hit upon the latter.As a director, Chbosky's strength is capturing the nostalgia of his story, the emotions in particular from the unadulterated mirth to the sad, sad loneliness. With such talented blooming actors at his disposal, the film becomes all about them and we can't help but identify with them.The world of ""Wallflower"" is stereotypical high school, but somehow, even though countless films do the same thing, ""Perks"" feels authentic. Maybe its the setting of Pittsburgh, the king of blue-collar cities, along with the early '90s setting. Regardless of when you went through this phase of your life, there's something so identifiable in the way this film presents it.Charlie (Logan Lerman) is one of those protagonists that we all identify with too, and that's ultimately what makes this story powerful. We all have times when we feel like we didn't fit in, when we were ignored, when we felt like no one noticed us. And because Charlie wants to have friends, he isn't afraid to put himself in situations to succeed socially, we like him a lot. He's not the kind of loner who spurns the world around him.We meet Charlie upon his first day of high school. It's rough to be a freshman and Charlie has no friends. None. Everyone he was friends with as a kid has spurned him in some way and his best friend took his own life the previous spring. He's afraid to do anything to stand out, to embrace what makes him special. Fortunately, he puts himself in position to meet Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), two seniors who don't fall into any clique other than their self-described ""misfits"" label. They are sweet, genuine people (as characters and the actors playing them) and they embrace Charlie. We come to love them in a vicarious way, for reaching out to Charlie as we ourselves would like to.Another part of what makes ""Wallflower"" a great story is that while we identify so strongly with Charlie at first, we eventually come to learn more and more about him and to the point that we can't even truly imagine what it's like to be him. We both pity him and come to admire him all the more for having a strength we're not sure we could ever have.The bulk of the film showcases their adventures, along with Charlie's growing affection toward Sam and his relationship with other friends in their group. Every little scene evokes something keen, namely what we loved about being in high school. Drama and serious issues crop up too, but with them comes the implicit understanding that these were the problems we faced in high school and even if we would do things differently now, that's what we probably would've done then.Not enough praise can be given to the trio of Lerman, Miller and Watson for bringing those feelings to life. Lerman is brilliant when it comes to portraying Charlie's introversion and communicating the mess in his head that we don't fully comprehend until the end. He should drop the Percy Jackson act and find more indie projects.After seeing ""We Need to Talk About Kevin,"" I thought I would never like Miller, ever, and always associate him with that terrifying title role, but he nails the courageous and flamboyant gay best friend, embodying the stereotype and then subverting it. His line delivery cuts the tension at the most ideal moments and he's the most lovable part of the movie by far. Sam is the weakest of the main characters, the girl next door with a troubled past that likes all the wrong guys. We're given her very much as Charlie sees her or any lonely teenager with a crush on the one he thinks he'll never get sees her. Watson, however, does a nice job keeping Sam's fragility with her at all times. When she's happy, it's an emotional breakthrough, and we get more of a sense of her character on the inside in spite of what the script gives us.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" doesn't break ground ground from a cinematic or storytelling perspective, but it does what it does — chiefly appeal to the emotions — as good as any movie out there.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"The movie is written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, the very same person who wrote the amazing book of which the film is an adaptation of. It's a unique situation, given that it's entirely his vision and artistic integrity no matter how many changes there are between the two mediums. Not that there's anything to complain about between the two; the movie surprised me in just how heartfelt and genuine it came across and while it (of course) wasn't as powerful as the book, it still ended up being the most earnest and emotional coming of age film I have ever seen.The beauty of it all is in just how well it captures the human state of becoming 'someone', no matter what we think we should be or what we're afraid of. In this case, it's more about what we're afraid of people learning about ourselves. In this case, our characters come from very dark, abused and broken places and somehow it manages to inspire and give hope to the audience.While this is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor is it for the general 'popcorn crowd', it is absolutely a quintessential film experience that should be shared by those who want to grow, learn, and most importantly, understand others. The film does a phenomenal job of capturing the positive and life defining influences of friends, literature, music and love. The cast could not have been better, although, I do feel like Emma Watson dropped the ball on having the inner turmoil that her character required. Something that may have been done better by someone with more acting experience but nevertheless I have no real complaints at all. The small roles by Paul Rudd, Tom Savini, Nicholas Braun, and Joan Cusack brought a tremendous amount of weight to the film; all were exquisite. Don't be afraid of anything!Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this quick read. Then see the film. You'll thank me later."
"A lot of people try to pin Perks as a coming of age movie. It is very much that, but it's also a whole lot more as well. A lot of its themes, such as how the friends who get us through tough times are to be treasured, translate to any age.Chbosky has very successfully translated his incredible novel onto the screen, preserving most of the critical elements loved by millions of fans. You can tell this movie was deeply personal for him, and it shows in his direction, locations and in his screenplay. Although Chbosky had limited directorial experience, I was impressed.This was truly an actor's movie, and the casting was perfect all the way through. I thought the three leads all did equally well in their respective roles. They were all amazing. Many seem to think Ezra Miller did the best of the three; while he perfectly brought the lively, charismatic Patrick to life, and played a perfect balance between being outgoing and reflecting some deep inward hurt, I didn't think his performance was any better than the other two. He actually had the easiest role to play. Logan Lerman was absolutely brilliant as Charlie, an extremely difficult part to do well. Logan perfectly captured the deep awkwardness, uncertainty and thoughtfulness of his character, as well as the emotions raging within him, from his tortured memories to his aching crush on Sam. As a viewer, you form a deep bond with him.I find it surprising that Emma Watson seems to get the least kudos. She had the most to prove, burdened with the doubts about acting ability (fair or not) that seem to go to actors from blockbuster franchises. There should be no more questions about whether she can act outside of Potter, as she did Sam spot on. I thought Sam was the most enigmatic character in the book, and Emma wonderfully captured all the deep nuances of her character. Just from her facial expressions and presence alone she hinted at Sam's internal conflicts and self doubts, and is believable as the girl Charlie would fall heavily for. All the cast seemed realistic as close friends, and there was some great on-screen chemistry , particularly between Emma and Logan, that will at times bring on the tears.Regardless of your age, there's something here for everyone. It's just a plain good movie. The amazing thing is that Emma Watson apparently had to go from studio to studio begging for a few dollars to get this amazing book made into a movie. Even after turning out extremely well, it is still playing in far fewer theaters than some of the less than stellar ""mainstream"" Hollywood offerings."
"Tone, Script & Story: Charlie is a fifteen year old boy. His best friend has committed suicide. He is also suffering from mental illness. He has newly took admission in High School. Being an introvert it's difficult but he manages to get friends and love.I liked the character of Patrick the most. It brings more soul to this drama, the fun elements are fantastic. I like the relationship that builds between Charlie and Sam despite all to's and fro's. The idea lying in the phrase 'We accept the love we think we deserve' makes one think.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Movie is adapted from the novel of Stephen Chbosky. He is also the director. It's once again proved the movies adopted from books are better if taken into average consideration.Music: For me music was good, if you belong to the audience listening to English music, I feel you would find it even better. Acting: Justified. Final Verdict: It is one of the high school affairs which it delighting. It keeps you entertained and going. It is worth adding to your collection."
"You may like Perks of being a wallflower if you enjoy a story with a lot of drama, with a big and important message behind, which makes you cry for good reasons and more, with greeeat young actors and actresses. Inspiring, moving, touching, with an amazing soundtrack. If you like all this, you need to watch this masterpiece!!!
The phrase that i mentioned in the title of my review, changed my life and my perception about all the things. Really did that!!
Like Charlie who felt a wallflower, i felt like this most part of my life and i regret of that. This film is much more than a simple high school movie, is real, is about how the people can be amazing with each other, the opposite also, unfortunately, and how to deal with this!!
Charlie, Sam and Patrick deliver such great performances and you related with that, you know? Is real problems, with real solutions. Is really impressive. 
In the end you feel as if you could face everything and everyone, accepted who you are and deal with the fear and the doubt of yourself. YOU FEEL INFINITE <3"
"Nirvana had it right. This film, set in the grunge heyday, was full of the teenage angst that sells films and albums, but that leaves a empty space when life moves on. Sure, it is an interesting coming of age story, but I am bored with it's redundancies. Not much has changed from then to now so there is not so much a kudos on it being a period piece, as many reviews had suggested, and in the places where it should have shown a difference in that age and this, it was not so accurate. Also, as much as I love Emma Watson, she seemed timid and her American accent was flimsy. The best part of this film was the character of Patrick, which is a given. The book seemed so much more profound when I read it in my teens, but I can't say if it is the story that had changed for the film, or just me changing with age."
"Teenage years are the best days of one's life which is full of energy , vibes , freedom , friends and infatuations. It is also a phase when you have develop a crush on someone's and willing to do anything to make that person happy. The Perks of Being a Wallflower makes you laugh , thrilled and love every moment of your life. An introvert feels lonely at a high school being avoided and rejected by almost everyone there. Under the shadow of two seniors, his life began to change and he slowly realizes his self-worth eventually feeling alive.Based on acclaimed novel of same name , The Perks of Being a Wallflower is written , produced and directed by the first timer Stephen Chbosky. It is one of the movie which you will watch it with little hope but will be spell bounded when you are leaving the theater. The feel-good entertainer comes as complete surprise and is sure gonna excite you with teenage crush candy floss story. The script is engrossing which will engage you till the end. Special mark for excellent camera work. I loved scenes shot in the tunnel. Dialogues are inspiring and punching.Background score is soothing and tuneful. There is a very good twist in the end which is very good. 3 pioneers characters Charlie , Sam and Patrick carries the movie on their shoulder with taut and brave performances. The actors are natural to their core and expresses brilliantly in every scene.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is refreshing , cheerful , vibrant and full of life. Watch it to make an eve to remember. Excellent 4.5/5"
"well, I've been hearing about this movie since it was out and i saw the trailer and thought it was OK, nice cast(Logan lerman and Emma Watson)but i wasn't that fascinated and one day i was checking the best 20 movies of 2012 and it was in there so i said what the hick am going to see it so i did and thank god in heavens for that because this indie weird flick is one of my favorite 10 movies of all times and right close to the top, it's deep, honest, sweetly romantic, surprising( the story and performances) crazy, fun, hopeful, mind opening , and the list will never end. maybe you'll say am being too emotional and you'r right because it touched me on a personal level because i know how it feels to be trapped in a dark past and how we try to break free by looking for some place or someone to belong to i cried at the end because i remembered how i got here, but for anyone else this movie is going to mesmerize you for many reasons: 1) Logan and Emma's chemistry is breath-taking, Ezra miller is such a complicated funny honest deep character, and Logan lerman is so matured and darn sexy, if you hated Emma in harry potter like i did you'l completely forget that she's even British or that you'v seen her before she's mind blowing, also the colors of the movie are very warm and they just make you feel comfortable"
"I probably would not call this a high-school romantic comedy about how a geek learns how to survive high-school because the characters within this film are not your typical cookie-cutter Hollywood characters, and also that the film is actually a lot darker and grittier than many of the other films that I have seen. For instance, there is a lot more to Charlie than your typical Hollywood character, whose only flaw, if you actually want to call it a flaw, is their geekiness.Charlie is a character with a lot of baggage, but as is true with many people who have suffered significant trauma in their younger years, much of this baggage has been blacked out, and in fact as we move through the film, we begin to learn that Charlie himself suffers a lot of blackouts. It is done in a way that we as the viewer are unsure as to what is going on, but in a way this helps us understand the character more because, while he knows that he does suffer from some undisclosed mental illness, he is as much in the dark as we are, and for much of the film we are simply told that it is 'his problem'.The movie is not so dark as to create a bad home life for the character though, because it is clear that his parents and his siblings do actually support him, even if it is only at home. However, it does give a very good reflection of the nature of high school in the developing world, particularly since we see how difficult it can be to actually fit in when in reality you are an outcast, and in fact Charlie himself ends up becoming connected with the outcasts themselves.Having experienced such a culture in my younger years, I must admit that many of us who were the introverts in high-school would end up connected with those of our kin, I know I did, and these groups would end up dulling their pain through the use of drugs. I still remember discovering at university that the group that I ended up connecting with ended up being made up of those very much like myself. It is interesting in a way that some groups that I interacted with would talk about how they were outcasts but I never really felt as if I were able to truly connect with those outcasts, but others than I knew I did have a way of connecting with them.In a way it seems to reflect so much on how our society has evolved, or should I say de-evolved. In many ways our society is becoming more and more disconnected as we speak. These days it is rare for parents, even loving and supporting parents, to be able to connect with their children, and it is very common for them to have no idea on where they are when they are no longer in the house. It can reach a point, as it does in the movie, that the child is found lying flaked out in the snow, with no idea as to how the child arrived at this point, but a discovery is still made that the child has been using drugs. In many cases it is not discovered until it is too late."
"Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" may not be an original film dealing with high school ups and downs, but it could very well be a very strong addition to the genre. It marks a great directorial debut from Chbosky, who also wrote the screenplay which is based on his own novel. It is always a pleasure to see an author/novelist have the freedom to express his own material in a different medium, and do it so professionally.The film centers around introvert Charlie and his struggles during freshman year in high school. Charlie is struggling with making new friends due to personal tragedies which affected him negatively. This may not be new, but in the hands of a lesser director, could make it worse. Chbosky knows what he is doing and fine-tunes his actors to fit his story the way he wants it - raw and real. True to introverts, this movie and Chbosky really get what they're thinking and how they can cope with friends, bullies and tragedies. Chbosky understood the themes and his actors understood the material very well, so this film is not the usual teen film. The three main actors shape themselves around their characters perfectly. Logan Lerman is great as Charlie in a performance that is emotional, subtle, withdrawn and quirky in places. He really can get intense at moments too. Ezra Miller, who terrified us in ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" last year, turns 180 degrees and delivers a likable, hilarious, often touching character in Patrick, who is half the key to Charlie's quest for friendship. The other half is the lovely Emma Watson as Sam, Patrick's stepsister and Charlie's first love. Watson, in her first attempt to shed off her ""Harry Potter"" image is witty, charming and cute, and still manages to give out a heartfelt performance. She's the kind of pretty girl that all boys like to see, and give guys like Charlie hopes and dreams - and possibly save them, too. Other actors in the movie of note are Mae Whitman as Charlie's first date, Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott as Charlie's parents and Nina Dobrev and Zane Holtz as Charlie's siblings. They sort of fade into the background once Charlie gets with his friends, but they're there when Charlie has no one, like all families should be. Oh, and Paul Rudd as the likable literature teacher. Makes you want him to be in your class one day.Chbosky does not stray from the roots of realism. Even though the film may tread familiar teen movie ground as desirable as it should, Chbosky firmly plants this movie's feet into the realistic ground. This film struck a personal chord with me, too. It really touched me as I am an introvert as well since high school, although not as serious and intense as Charlie, I feel him. Some scenes were pleasant to watch, some scenes were intense and brought back many unwanted/awkward memories, and other times it had me thinking even further.The fact that this film contains mature themes of suicide, homosexuality, drug and sexual content, and still be given a PG-13 rating is nothing short of a miracle. Bottom line is, if you're a teen or an introverted young adult, make sure this movie is on the top of your watch list. This is a great teen film.Overall: 84%"
"Every once in awhile a movie comes along that completely surprises you. After sifting through all the major blockbusters that come out every year there is always a movie like ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"", written and directed by Pittsburgh's own Stephen Chbosky, that surpasses everyone's expectations and ends up being one of the best films of the year, despite being an independent film. ""Perks"" does so many things right. Chbosky assembled a cast and then knocked this thing out of the park. He does something big blockbuster so often don't do, he makes you characters that genuinely care about which makes the film as powerful as any other you will see this year. I highly recommend ""Perks"", if for no other reason than that it's by far one of the most heartfelt and original films you will see this year."
"Our 14-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria Burns, found this film to be the ""best she has ever seen"" and noted that ""this movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful."" Below is her review.I can honestly say that it was one of, if not the best movie that I have ever seen. It was so pivotal that it almost made me cry, and that says a lot because I almost never cry. It was great to see a movie that beautifully showed some of the struggles that real teenagers go through and not sugar coated. This movie is very emotional and has great acting. I like the way the flashback scenes are shown, by alternating from the present to the past, then showing the aftermath after the flashbacks. I had never seen Emma Watson in anything but the Harry Potter series, and she is amazing playing Sam, I have never seen her play a character like this. The movie is so good that no words can explain. I bought the book directly after I watched the movie. I also love how throughout the whole movie most of the story is told by Charlie (Logan Lerman) who writes letters anonymously to ""A Friend"" who doesn't exist. This movie is about a severely depressed and lonely boy, Charlie, whose best friend killed himself before the school year starts. So now, Charlie has no friends and people think he is weird because he holds in and takes the pain of himself and all of the people he loves, sometimes it all wells up and he has anxiety attacks. This year he is determined to make friends and he meets the flamboyant Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). They let him in and introduce him to a whole new world filled with fun, sadness, and just plain life. Plus, he falls in love with Sam along the way. All of Charlie's friends are seniors, and he makes a mistake that makes them go away for a while. But then he does something to make them love him even more than before. I think that everyone should watch this movie. I like how, whenever something bad or slightly inappropriate happens in the flashbacks, the scene hints at what was happening without blatantly showing what happened. My favorite quote from the movie is when Charlie's English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) tells him that, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" I think it is so profound and absolutely true. I recommend this movie for eighth graders going into high school up to any adult. This movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful. I give it five out of five stars because this movie is amazing and will someday be a classic."
"Actually I don't think there was a single shark attack. I kept thinking throughout the film, ""maybe this is where the shark will come and attack."", but i don't even recall a scene where any characters were even near the ocean. The whole story takes place around Pittsburgh, which is in western Pennsylvania. This is an area world renowned for having no sharks. The cast was great, Ezra Miller being the standout, but I feel like they shouldn't sell a movie on a marketing campaign around shark attacks, and then have no gosh darn shark attacks. The movie felt as if it were leading up to a trip to the ocean, where Logan Lerman's character would be attacked by a shark. This motion picture was almost all build up with no payoff, the payoff here being that there were no sharks, and no shark attacks. Jaws was a good movie, because it promised shark attacks, was suspenseful, and had shark attacks. That is how you make quality cinema."
"I hadn't heard of The Perks of Being a Wallflower book before this film came out but apparently it's a big hit with people my age (albiet particularly girls). I wasn't interested until it started doing very well with audiences to the point where it entered IMDb's top 250, and is still in a solid position. I wasn't excited but I was intrigued. I was mostly intrigued at the prospect of the author of the original book writing the screenplay and directing the film himself. Can the author of the source material finally do justice and equal the book? Can this be a genuinely original and heartfelt high school movie? The answer is no. Not in Stephen Chbosky's hands anyway. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a self-pitying dead weight inhabited with paper thin characters whose personality is replaced with eccentricity, let alone lack of depth. To be fair, that is what high school feels like, but it's an awful unpleasant feeling I don't want to relive. Its lead character is a cardboard cutout whose interesting moments of change are so left field and bizarre that it's difficult to connect with him at all.Emma Watson has a terribly inconsistent American accent and lacks any identity beyond a vague irritating Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Ezra Miller does have some welcome enthusiasm, given his restrained performance in We Need To Talk About Kevin, but his character is all over the place. It's a film that deals with a zillion things at once and all of them are clichés in and area I wouldn't be able to relate to even if I was in my equivalent of high school. But the most off- putting part is the horrible lighting and set design. The film might have been okay if it wasn't so poorly lit but that's a stretch. It hits a few interesting notes here and there but it's nothing redeeming and they're swiftly ruined by the next moment approached awkwardly. However, it does have an excellent taste in music and features a lot of my favourites, unfortunately it has no idea how to use them and frustrates me as it cuts before the good part. There's also the big gap in logic of Emma Watson having pretty great taste in music but having no clue what an incredibly famous David Bowie song is. But hey, if this film introduces a generation to this great music, fine. Not my preferred method.3/10"
"Yet another movie that I am baffled by the rating and positive response. The acting is very awkward and forced. Logan does a pretty good job... he didn't talk a whole lot. He would just say his one line and looks would be exchanged and then end scene. Emma's accent was horrendous. I swear there were moments of actually pauses and silence in her scenes because the three actors must not have spent enough time together because their friendship didn't seem real at all. I hate when movies have to cram all these scenes from the book into a short movie, it hardly ever works out for the fans. I just wanted MORE from it! I didn't get that deep emotional feeling I got from reading the book."
"I first found out about this movie from my older sister who's name I won't reveal here. She knew I enjoyed The Breakfast Club and every other John Hughes movie and she also knew I had a massive crush on Emma Watson. So she told me that I would enjoy this film. We watched it together on a rainy Friday night when my parents went out to dinner. I went into this movie with the spirit of all of John Hughes movies in my mind. But I was wrong. As I'm watching this movie, I was shocked and disturbed by how horrible this movie was. This movie wasn't even remotely like any of John Hughes' movies. I rather watch those movies any day over this train wreck. This movie relies on massive dark and depressing clichés as seen in all teen movies such as abusive family members, underage drinking/drug use/partying, bullying, crying over how no one accepts you, etc. The some of those things actually triggered bad memories for me which I won't go into here. The partying scenes are so ridiculous. As I'm watching these scenes, I kept expecting Arnold Schwarzenegger from Kindergarten Cop to show up with a shotgun and shoot up the party and say ""I'm the party pooper"". The only thing that kept the movie going for me was Emma Watson. I just kept watching the movie for her scenes. But other than that, I could barely maintain my sanity while watching this garbage. The worst moment in this movie is Charlie's breakdown scene. This is literally the most overacted scene in any movie I have ever scene. It's almost to the point of unwatchable. I wanted to give up from here, but I didn't. Another big flaw I noticed with this movie was all the dark color tinting. This movie was supposed to be a teen dramedy not a horror movie. It makes The Breakfast Club look like Twilight. I'm not saying The Breakfast Club was hilarious. I'm saying that movie was more bright and colorful and had more humor in it than this. Anyway, after I finished this movie, I immediately did a Bill Murray marathon which consisted of Stripes, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Meatballs and Caddyshack as an attempt to cleanse myself from the filth of this movie. If you want to maintain your sanity and not bring back traumatic memories, do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this movie as you can. Don't waste your time on this big pile of feces that this movie is. You'll thank me for this one day. That is all."
"Few films really know anything about teenagers. These days we get vampires, mad slashers, and toilet humor, but we rarely ever get characters with hearts, minds, feelings and fears. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a rare and glorious joy, a movie that knows the fear and confusion of the years between childhood and adulthood, a time that is about growing up and discovering the mysteries of life, not about superpowers or American pies. Here is a movie so knowledgeable about how young people talk and think that it may someday earn a place alongside the best teenage movies ever made, films like Rebel Without a Cause, American Graffiti, The Breakfast Club, Say Anything . . ., and Juno. It's that good.Like all of those great films, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not about a plot, but about lives being lived. The story takes place within characters that are so well-defined that we find the story in their actions, not in a screenwriter's manipulation. The story takes place in the late-90s but the screenplay is so generous that almost any generation could recognize some of it in their own histories.Based on the popular epistolary young adult novel by Stephen Chbosky, who also directs, The Perks of Being a Wallflower centers on a young high school kid named Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is a meek, unassuming tenant of this world, a kid so shy and unremarkable that you could probably spend four years attending the same school and never notice him. That, at least, is the way his fellow students see him. We meet him at home, with his mom and dad and a sister who is dating a loser. Charlie's heart is damaged because of a tragedy long ago. His aunt died in an accident on his birthday. Years have gone by but Charlie still nurses fresh wounds. His act of self-therapy is to write in a private journal to someone he calls ""My friend."" We meet him as he is entering high school, a place where he is both mocked and ignored. It isn't long before – much to his amazement – he makes some friends. One is a flamboyant gay kid named Patrick (Ezra Miller) who has a joke or a line for each and every occasion. He's the ever-present M.C. of his immediate surroundings. For a while, Patrick's overabundant personality seems one-note until late in the film when he begins to confide in Charlie some things about his own dark past that break his jolly facade. Miller is a good actor whose exuberant performance is a complete turnaround from the quiet, sullen killer that he played last year in We Need to Talk about Kevin.The other is Patrick's half-sister Sam, played in a brilliant performance by Emma Watson whose presence still contains echoes of Hermione Granger. Once, Sam was the school slut, who got the attention of the boys by making herself an object of lust. Casting off that skin, she lives a cleaner life but now has to live with feelings of regret. She's not the typical Movie Girlfriend who has all the easy answers contained in a tender smile. She stirs the poetry in Charlie's soul, but she is afraid to move toward love. Sam is a particular human being, not a cliché, the rare kind of teenager who seems to be waiting for something. She doesn't live in the moment but is always looking forward. She seems to be a victim of time itself, trapped in a body and an age that won't let her press forward fast enough. You can see the need in her eyes, a need to be somewhere else. That's probably why she is working so hard to get away from her past and into a good college. Watson's performance is a revelation. Her eyes and her body language speak the volumes. Sam is a fully realized soul, Watson deserves an Oscar nomination.The movie is not, however, completely somber and serious. It is also clever and funny, especially in a scene in which Charlie is pushed into a role at The Rocky Horror Picture show that puts him into the kind of contact with Sam's budding breasts of which he probably have few objections. Within his new circle of friends he finds himself attending an alarming number of high school parties, one of which has him sampling the host's fresh batch of brownies – several in fact – with predictable results. Charlie is nudged into experiences that few parents would agree with, but that Charlie will certainly never forget, no matter how hard he tries. The unique circle of friends also includes a sweet but cloying girl who will briefly become Charlie's first girlfriend. She is Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) who has little interest in Charlie as a person, but more of an interest in just having a boyfriend. She quickly gets on his nerves and their relationship comes to a devastating conclusion that we don't expect.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is unpredictable because it depends on the actions of the characters, both in the serious and the comic moments. They are written and acted with such specific detail that we can feel the even flow of their lives. There is drama, joy, heartbreaks, mistakes, misunderstandings, romance, laughter and revelations. It is a breath of fresh air to finally encounter a screenplay that lets the characters be human beings. It feels the joy and tragedy of the awkward passage of the teenage years. This is a film so smart about life that you find yourself nodding with recognition. It is one of the best films of the year."
"For years, ""Big Fish"" has been my favorite movie. Others have come close, I even had to make a pro and con list when I saw ""The Sandlot"" again a while back to compare the two. But none have matched Big Fish. I have read the book for Perks of Being a Wallflower years ago, and fell in love with it. Naturally, when the movie was announced I was a bit skeptical but when i Learned Mr. Chbosky, (the author) was writing and directing, I knew It would have to be something special. I went to the midnight on the night of the 27th to see it after a year of heavy anticipation, and the moment it was over, I didn't even have to think about it, I knew that this was my new favorite movie. It embodied everything about the book perfectly, while only discarding a few things that I'm sure many will agree are fine being left out. The cast is by far the best part of the movie. When I learned Logan Lerman was attached I was annoyed because he didn't seem like someone who could maintain the frailty of Charlie. However, he created the most innocent, awkward, sad and adorable Charlie that i could have imagined. He was absolutely perfect, as were the scene stealing Ezra Miller as Patrick, and the absolutely beautiful Emma Watson as Sam.I've seen it twice over the weekend, and plan on seeing it many times more, especially to continually re-watch the absolutely epic and nostalgic dance scene between Watson and Miller, (You'll know what I mean when you see it.) So I recommend this to anyone who has or has not read the book, and hope that it consumes your soul like it did mine."
"Really dreadful horrible shoddy movie with awkward platitudes and questionable morals. I went to see it for free and I still feel cheated. Went with a group of about 8 and the only good thing we could say about it between us was that it would make other films appear better.The story jumps from unexplained and unexpanded disaster to disaster, not dwelling or addressing any of the issues but simply providing lip service to everything that could possibly go awry in a life, in the process creating characters that you can't begin to feel any empathy for as they are simply not believable.The script writing was abysmal, I'll admit we laughed, but the tears were of pain and the laughs were awkward and well and truly AT and in pity of everyone associated with this train crash."
"MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.I just got around to watching this movie. I was really looking forward to it - I had never heard of the book, but I really liked Emma Watson in the Harry Potter series and I generally like watching coming-of-age movies. And after the first 30 minutes, my pleasant anticipation seemed entirely justified. I really loved the first half an hour, it had so many great scenes in it: The innocent Charlie eating a hash brownie and being high for the first time, blabbering entertaining absurdities and demanding a milkshake, Emma Watson experiencing freedom while listening to David Bowie and of course my favorite, the awesome high school dance where Sam and Patrick do the 'living room dance'. So, after about 1/3 of its runtime, the movie looked really promising to me.Sadly, it went all downhill from there for me. One reviewer here stated that he liked about this movie how it replaced 'tired clichés' and while I of course respect anyone's opinion, I actually felt a lot of clichés were merely repeated here. The shy, introverted guy with the good heart, who likes poems and reading, falls in love with the good-looking, upbeat girl whose only negative character trait seems to be constantly falling for douches. Her stepbrother, Patrick, is gay and dating one of the popular football playing kids, Brad, who is secretly gay, but obviously doesn't want to tell anybody and instead hides his relationship with Patrick. Eventually, Brad's father catches the two making out and punishes his son violently.Meanwhile, Charlie and Sam clearly have romantic feelings for each other, but Sam has a boyfriend and because of this, Charlie doesn't dare to ask her out. He gets in a distinctively unhappy relationship with one of their friends instead, Mary Elizabeth, but eventually has to confess he doesn't love her and only wants Sam. In the end, it is revealed that Sam's boyfriend has cheated on her the whole time, because, well, he's a douche, and before Sam leaves for university, she and Charlie finally get their big romantic moment they've been craving all along, confessing their love for each other and making out enthusiastically.Doesn't that sound awfully familiar? To me, it does. It's the typical romance 'chick-flick' structure, just mixed with a coming-of-age tale here. I awarded six stars to this movie because, even though it's clichéd, there's no denying it's well done - the acting is decent, the dialog is mostly good and the soundtrack is awesome. The little twist at the end regarding Charlie's aunt comes unexpected and makes kind of sense, but wasn't absolutely necessary to the story in my opinion. All in all, a decent movie with a lot of heart that really cares for its characters, but definitely no revelation and a little overrated here on IMDb, me thinks."
"Warning spoilers!The movie starts out with the main character making some outrageous claims about high school. You know the typical American whining ""school is prison"" ""I am stuck here"" ""It's the most horrible thing ever"" Really? There are people that are starving, there are wars in other countries, there are rampant diseases, severe poverty, high crime rates. Yet High School is the worst thing ever? Ugh, this is why from the get go I knew that this was a 8u11$#!t movie.To have a good movie you have to have a BELIEVABLE introduction to base the movie on. When your premise is FALSE then the entire movie is (r@p. It all just fell apart from there.So this guy goes to school. So far all I got from the movie is total lies. I am WAITING for some REAL, FACTUAL thing to go on. Something to connect to. Really ANYTHING!!!! I got nothing. Just more lies. A guy gets back from being sick and people MAKE FUN OF HIM!? WTF!? Omg, MORE LIES! People would FEEL SORRY FOR HIM! Wow, the girl that calls him names in his English class is totally unrealistic!So now we are into the movie and absolutely NOTHING has happened. I have no clue who this kid is, who his family is, who his new friends are, or even what time period this is even supposed to be taking place in. I mean how unclear can one movie be!? Can't they have put some text stating the year at the start of the movie? More confusion and lies! Also if this is supposed to take place in the 80's or even 90's then they are dressed ALL WRONG! Their hair is ALL WRONG! Ugh, people DID NOT DRESS LIKE THAT! If you just want to dress people in the style of today then set the d@mn movie in the present! Except for the odd over sized sweaters here and there I did not see much authentic old fashion. Looks like you can buy all the stuff they are wearing at forever 21!At this point the movie felt like it was 3, possibly 4 hours long. That's what happens when ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is happening! I was not even a half hour into this not even 2 hour movie! So basically at this point we are told that these people who became the main guy's friend are 'outcasts' WTF!? Umm, yeah tell their screaming fans that they are unattractive. If Logan Lerman walked down the street he would probably be chased by fans, the same with Emma Watson, and so on. Emma did a pretty bad job as usual. Her pointless head bobbing, wooden acting, and terrible accent were all present. Again the movie has not given me ANYTHING to grab onto as real. I have been lied to, and it's just continuing.So to wrap things up we learn that BOTH Emma, and Logan's characters were molested/raped/abused/etc. as children. OK? So that is grounds for falling in love? So your abuse defines you? Wow what a horrible message this movie sends. Talking about messages; this movie is jam paced with every cliché possible. I was wondering if they managed to fit them all in there! Here goes: life sucks, hs is the worst thing ever, we are infinite, we will become parents one day, no one can take hs experiences away from us, friends are forever, don't let men beat you, be yourself, don't dumb yourself down for a man, we are helpless to 'save' any one, enjoy the moment, etc.I even forgot how the movie ended it was so pointless and meaningless. As for the entire movie I was lied to. I could not make heads nor tails of this movie. I just felt like I had to write this review to urge people not to watch the movie and bring the misleading rating down. This movie does not have enough 1 star reviews! It's bad in every way shape and form. There is no: realistic story, character development, time frame, truth. Ugh I'm getting a head ache. Avoid this movie. It seems like the only reason people saw this movie was because they were fans of the actors. Sad. This is the reason movie quality has steadily been going down. People don't care what the movie even is as long as they get to stare at some actor. That's why (r@p like this is even allowed to be made. No wounder to took so long to make this movie, no studio would green light it! But in today's celebut@rd obsessed world it was...."
"I'm much aware people are going to hate me to death for my opinion about this picture, but I'm saying it anyway. From the get go I already knew it was gonna be a movie for a ""Juno"" audience-- mainly because of the irritating teenagers there were in my cinema session. Logan Lerman plays a typical nerd who nobody cares about, and as predictable as it could be, he becomes a nice guy after some while, whereas the nice guys become boring. That's been used in 26548761234 past American movies and I really don't understand HOW IMDb users miss that. Emma Watson is just boring as she is in every movie. The main couple is completely predictable, irritating, and when they had their first kiss was the catalyst for me to leave the cinema room-- something I've NEVER done in my entire life. Surely soundtrack is also horrible; be prepared to listen to strange rock-likely gangs-- if you like rock, you won't enjoy it. All in all, it's just another typical American teenage drama with nothing else to offer you."
"1) You are the author of the novel / writer of the screenplay / director of the film / real life teenage sufferer as described in the story. The events are your life, thus boring or not boring, you love to see them translated on the screen.2) You are a teenager yourself, going through a time which might be similar to the one experienced by any of the protagonists, so you feel yourself identified with their story. In any of the two previous cases, you probably think this movie is a masterpiece. If nothing of the above applies, you might think as I do: This is a movie with great performances, but the story is absolutely flat and extremely predictable with huge clichés as main characters. It feels they have used the same pattern as in any other ""coming of age story"". The only thing which is not that predictable (all the mental issues plot which I won't discuss here to keep this spoiler free) is very overlooked by the main story, and when it gets into it, it gets a treatment very in a rush, as if the writer didn't think it's so important. And by the way, the image of teenagers listening to ""The Smiths"" and stating how great taste in music they have, not listening to other mainstream garbage, is already a parody. In fact, when ""The Smiths"" name was said for the first time in this movie, I couldn't avoid laughing. I will stay away from upcoming coming of age stories, unless they prove to be more original and don't use so many clichés.And for the writers out there: Nobody cares about how much you suffered in high school... except people going through high school, so I guess you can understand how people outside high school is not very interested in what you have to say."
"As I downloaded this film from iTunes, I didn't have great expectations for it but thought it would be a fun watch to pass some time. After only a few minutes I was drawn in and immersed in a rich cast and story.The movie not only follows the main character through his social life, but also through his thoughts as he struggles with a problematic childhood memory which, for me, made the film. The flashbacks give an amazing view of the character and help to define his personality and make him very human to the point I could relate very well.Through the highs and lows of the detailed times, the viewer is swept through emotions with the character. I, personally, finished the film on the verge of crying a mixture of tears of sadness and joy.The casting is absolutely perfect and I cannot imagine anyone better to play the parts, which heavily supports the story and makes the characters more 'real'.This is a must watch film for everyone out there."
"Imagine yourself on the eve of your first day of high school. If you'd prefer not to, I get it, believe me. What if you'd just been released from the hospital? Do you really think you could rebound from that?Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), is a quiet, introspective teenager who has recently suffered a setback, the full nature of which we're not informed of, and is about to start his freshman year of high school. The only friend he makes on his first day is his English teacher, Bill Anderson (played by Paul Rudd). Rather than worry his parents, (played by Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh) Charlie gives the typical, one-syllable description of his first day of high school. Time passes and Charlie becomes friends with step-siblings Sam and Patrick. Sam (played by former Harry Potter actress Emma Watson) is an outgoing senior dating a college guy and her step-brother Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) is a flamboyant underachiever with a great sense of humor. They attend a football game together and follow that with a visit to a diner before driving Charlie home. The next function they attend as a group is a party where Charlie, unknowingly, ingests a pot brownie. It is during this moment of drug-fueled confidence that Charlie reveals to Sam the fact that he lost a friend to suicide one year ago. After quietly relaying that fact to Patrick, he and Sam both decide then and there that Charlie should become a full-fledged member of their group. Moments later, Charlie bears witness to a romantic encounter between Patrick and his closeted boyfriend, star football player Brad (played by Johnny Simmons). They leave the party, go for a drive, and hear a song that inspires Sam to stand in the bed of the pickup truck and stretch out her arms as they drive through a tunnel. This is when Charlie first develops romantic feelings for Sam which she is completely unaware of. There's a lot to like about this film. Miller and Watson's characters are both very endearing and their decision to adopt fellow outcast Charlie is a moment that brings hope for the character and life in general. There are elements I believe the film could do without. Examples include the one-sided relationship between two of the characters and the references to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which never resonated with me the way it seems to with others. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it greatly and encourage others to see it at their earliest possible convenience."
"Emotional, well thought, and revolutionary are three words that describe the film based off the acclaimed novel by Stephen Chewbosky. The movie The Perks of Being A Wallflower is the most true based, realistic movie of this generation. Not only will this movie bring you to the edge of your seat, but it will also make you feel a personal connection to the characters. Specifically, I think the perks of being a wallflower is worth the time and money to see is because of my own personal connection to Charlie (played by Logan Lerman). Throughout the story, Charlie deals with many hardships with his family, and newly found friends. For example, Charlies aunt was killed in a car accident on the way to buy his birthday present when he was a young boy. Throughout my own life, I have already dealt with situations that are unforgettable, such as my aunt getting cancer. Also, in the 8th grade, Charlie's good friend committed suicide. This affected Charlies personality deeply, and the way he acted around his peers.In the 7th grade, my friend was killed by bone marrow cancer, and the impact it had on me affected me as it did Charlie. The character of Sam (Emma Watson) also connected to my own life. Sam was on of the two seniors, the other being Patrick, who befriend Charlie when they meet at the homecoming football game? As soon as Charlie sees Sam, he falls in love with her. Sam believed that love never truly worked out for anyone, as did I. After breaking up with her boyfriend, Sam presents Charlie with a truly puzzling question. ""Why does I, and everyone, love the people who treat us like we're nothing?"" And Charlie answers ""we accept the love we think we deserve."" If we think low of ourselves, we are going to accept people who use us and don't love is for who we really are, but if we love ourselves, we can love others and treat them with higher regard. In addition, the realism throughout the film is what contributes to the beauty of the storyline. The way that Charlie deals with everything he sees is very realistic. Some people, When they see things occurring, they don't know what to do, so they just stand by and observe. That's what Charlie had been doing for some while since his friend died. Then, when he found people who let him in, he began to open up. At a party Patrick gives a toast to Charlie. In it he states, ""He's a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand."" It is in this moment that Charlie feels noticed, and completely happy for having friends. This movie also shows the real importance it is to have friends. Before Patrick and Sam, Charlies door was closed, and he refuses to let anyone in. Then, when he gained them as friends, he began to open up to the world, and he enjoyed it. Additionally, this film shows the realisticness of how people judge each other. Charlie's group of friends is judged for being freaks because they are not popular. Charlie is also labeled as a freak because he does not participate in activities. Nevertheless, people may oppose to see this movie. It is rated Pg-13, and many parents feel that they do not want their child to be exposed to the subjects the film discusses. I think that the film is appropriate for kids over 13, as it was rated. The film discusses things like death, personal relationships, teenagers being gay, and even rape. Although this film includes these topics, I think the film is worth seeing for teens. If parents try to hide their son or daughter from these things that occur everyday, they won't be prepared for real life on their own. Moreover, this story is recognized for its great script. The literature Charlie's uses as he writes portrays exactly how he feels as he writes. As Charlie was discussing his earlier trip to go sleeping he writes ""And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't."" This excerpt shows the literature and choice of writing the author uses. The film is also portrayed almost exact from the novel. I think that is part of the reason why this film did very well. The film was directed by Stephen Chewbosky, who also wrote the novel. Not only will this movie change the way you view life, but it will change the way you treat your own friends and family. Also, the people around you. You never know anyone story until they tell you, and you can't judge them until you walk a mile in their shoes. We could all use our own thoughts as an excuse to not participate, but we should choose not to. ""Because things change. Friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody."" We should be happy, and appreciate what we have and live for the moments that make us feel alive. As Charlie states in his own moment of pure happiness "" in that moment, I swear we were infinite."""
"Every decade has their coming-of-age story. People of the sixties had The Last Picture Show, seventies had American Graffiti, eighties had Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, and the only thing I can think of that the nineties had was She's All That. And now my generation of teenagers has Perks of Being a Wallflower. Based on the coming-of-age novel, which I haven't read, the movie follows Charlie, played by the guy from Percy Jackson, and his trials and tribulations of being a freshman in high school. He then meets Patrick, who I swear is a gay version of me, and his sister in law, Sam, played by Emma Watson (Harry Potter). This is an interesting blend of a lighter beat era film mixed with The Last Picture Show. It shows just how naive Charlie is going into high school. Like eating pot brownies, feeling awkward in different environments, and just being a wallflower a lot of the time. He find someone he loves and doesn't really know how to handle it because he's never loved before. He knows he loves her but doesn't know how to tell her and doesn't really know how to react when he dates somebody who he doesn't love. All three of the characters go through the usual mishaps in high school. Patrick is in love with the school's quarterback and they have a secret relationship because they are afraid that the people they love will resent them. It's a sad thing to have to live with being gay and I understand what he's going through. Then Sam is very promiscuous, always getting drunk and sleeping with men. When she finds love and then have it ripped away at the end, you feel heart broken for her because you love these characters by the end and you want to see them lead a good life in college. There's a line in the movie that perfectly sums up this movie, and life in high school. ""Why do I, and everyone I love, pick people who treat us like we're nothing?"" And the answer is, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" That speaks volumes because I actually know people who feels like this. It's amazing just how right this movie is. I do understand gays being shunned in school, and feeling awkward around a group of people, and having people treat you like we are nothing. I've never seen a movie where I feel a little bit like all of the characters. The performances are strong, the music is awesome, and you walk out of the theater knowing that no matter how bad life may feel in high school, it'll all be better in 1460 days."
"Movies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual high school today. No manic pixie dream girl (and her inclusive sidekick) really exist, certainly not in high school, and no unsuspecting nerd is going to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties and love affairs. If this movie weren't about something people everywhere, throughout all time, ever didn't experience for themselves, maybe it would be entertaining. But they do. So it's just insultingly saccharine. This movie should be categorized under fantasy, it's certainly not relatable for kids, I think it only really serves as a guidebook for the MPDG wannabe's. IE: it's tripe. Thank goodness I didn't see this while I was actually in high school and actually struggling or this would have made me feel worse."
