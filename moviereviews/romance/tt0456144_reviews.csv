"I saw Lage Raho Munnabhai last night and it's still in my head today. I always go to watch sequels with a bit of trepidation but Mr. Hirani soon eased my fears with a wonderfully thought out comedy that is funny and has a message which he puts across without being preachy. Most of the same cast back again with only Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi reprising their roles and playing the same characters again. This movie cannot be considered as a sequel as it is more of an episode in Munnabhai's life not unlike James Bond films or Charlie Chaplin's tramp.Sanjay Dutt is just perfect as Munnabhai... i cannot imagine anyone else playing this role. It was said that Munnabhai was first offered to Shahrukh Khan, while i do like the King Khan i feel he would have gone overboard with this role. Sanju baba plays with a lot of conviction and i believe his true character and honesty shine throughout the film. He handles the comedic and emotional scenes with ease.... so naturally. Good rapport with the Bapu character.Arshad Warsi a.k.a Sarkeshwar a.k.a Circuit was also brilliant ...excellent chemistry with sanju and had some nice sequences. I liked him since the time he appeared in Tere Mere Sapne... and is coming into his own as a Bollywood star in his own right.Vidya Balan was bright and chirpy... great teeth! Only disappointment was that Boman Irani did not have the same impact as he did with Dr. Astana but still a great performance. He makes the audience like and empathise with him even though he could be considered the villain of the piece.Direction was excellent, song sequences were handled beautifully with most of the songs being situational all well shot especially 'Samjho ho hi gaya' & 'Pal Pal Har pal'. This movie just proves that Bollywood movies can be just as good and entertaining as Hollywood while still giving us all the masala.We should all follow ""Gandhigiri"" but first let's support this great movie by praising it and WATCH IT IN THE CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!10/10."
"Incredible movie! The comedy was expected, and having developed his characters so well, Rajkumar Hirani couldn't possibly not make people laugh in this movie, but the most inspiring aspect was the message which was conveyed in such a beautiful, unpreachy way, something the audience would connect to. Definitely, no documentaries or books about Mahatma Gandhi could have had such an impact on the audience, and after watching this movie, I respect him much much more. The screenplay and direction was flawless. There was not a single moment when you wanted to take your eyes away from the screen, and the dialogues were as good as the first part, in fact better. Sanjay Dutt and Munnabhai are made for each other, and he couldn't have played the role better. But yeah, without Arshad Warsi, the movie wouldn't be half as good, and like the previous one, he's delivered. Vidya Balan really adds life to the movie, and if you really want to compare, I'd say she's done much better than Gracy Singh in the previous one. Incredibly beautiful, and she's got grace, I can only but praise her in this movie. Boman Irani, Diya Mirza and others have done there bit, and Hirani has very nicely used all these characters around the main ones. And last but not the least, Mahatma Gandhi, played by Dilip Prabhavalkar is something you will not forget. Throughout the movie, he wears this enlightened smile you fall in love with!The movie does have technical glitches, for instance, if vidya balan works at worldspace, how did her show air on FM radio and things like that, but you don't really care much about these things when you've just been through 2 and half hrs of sheer entertainment, where you laughed, cried, and every possible emotion you can go through with a movie. The movie has an incredible feel-good factor to it.So all said and done, the movie is a must watch, watch it asap! I doubt I'd find a single person around me who wouldn't like it."
"This is one the excellent movie that refreshed me to the core. A classic Vinod Chopra production, this movie does not only fulfill high expectations of the audience, being a sequel of Munnabhai MBBS, but exceeds it.A decent and hilarious comedy throughout, you can watch this movie with family and realize that superb comedy can be created even without vulgarity.On acting front, it is difficult to rank the actors as everyone has made his role alive. Sanjay Datt (Munnabhai), Circuit (Arshad Varsi) & Bomman Irani (Lucky Singh) have given their best performances.Cinematography is excellent and songs are appropriate to the situations.SO what is the best thing about this movie? Unlike most big-budget-glamorous Bollywood flicks, this movie entertains you, and still makes you think.It carries a message for today's generation!"
"What does one say about this movie? Coming on the heels of Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabai could prove to be another movie that stirs the conscience of the Indian masses, and dare I say, foreigners as well. Never before has Gandhiji's life and message been conveyed so simply, so beautifully and in such a rolling-in-the-aisle humorous manner. Everybody in the movie has played her or his role tremendously. Arshad Warsi and Sunjay Dutt make an explosive combination and Boman Irani is a riot. Don't be surprised if the thickest-skinned amongst you sheds a tear or two while laughing your guts out. You will walk out of the theater with a spring in your step, light in spirit, thankful that such a man as Gandhi walked the soil of our nation and inspired to become a little bit more like him. Even if a few of us are motivated to emulate Munnabhai's 'Gandhigiri', we could make a world of difference!"
"Probably, this is the best movie sequel ever produced in the Hindi cinema and surely would be one of the top ten comedy Hindi movies of all times. I can't remember if any comedy movie (hindi or other) ever been able to deliver such a strong message in such a subtle and non-preachy manner. Coming out of the cinema hall, you can't help from having that huge delightful smile on your face.. This movie isn't a sequel in its true sense; apart from the characters of Munnabhai and Circuit, there is nothing in common with its predecessor (unarguably, the movie would not have been possible without these two characters as in their original form). Few reasons which turn it to a must watch movie:1) awesome movie, with astounding screenplay, story, characterization and many other things. Its a 100% clean movie with no risqu√© dialogues, no item number, no vulgar dresses and no vulgar scenes, which is an achievement in today's times. 2) Performance of Munnabhai and Circuit duo - Sanjay dutt is undoubtedly the most lovable bollywood bhai, he is bit old now but still going very strong and Circuit has come up with his magic yet again, this guy's timing of dialogues is perfect... In all, the duo rocks!!!!!!! 3) Strong, strong and very strong message delivered... I won't delve much onto this or else risk disclosing the story and henceforth the fun... Everybody is going to respect Mahatma even more after watching this movie - bet you are going to love that enigmatic smile 4) Jhanavi (Vidya Balan)... such a graceful beauty, her face is like bright morning light; gosh, the lady literally smiles with her eyes, you are bound to fall in love with this gurl, just like Munnabhai.. apart from that she acts very well and gives a strong performance... There are many more things that make this movie memorable and a treat to watch.... surely, something to watch before you die :-)"
"The second innings of Munna Bhai and Ciruit in 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai' is one cracker of an innings! It's better than the first one, extracts more laughs and punches and the characters have a more humane temperament that explores the other side of 'bhaigiri'. The plot is truly the winning card of the movie, not to discount the effective casting, dialogues that are a mix of funny and introspective, a rib-tickling screenplay, enjoyable situational songs and a first rate direction. Sanjay Dutt as Munna Bhai and Arshad Warsi as Circuit wear their characters as their second skins, more comfortably, more snuggly and are more lovable than their avatars in the earlier Munna Bhai MBBS. Ditto for Boman Irani who dons the role of Lucky Singh, a sardarji builder; a meanie with a heart. Vidya Balan also puts her best foot forward as a radio jockey who makes Dutt's heart goes hmmm... Dia Mirza and Jimmy Shergill justify their cameo appearances. A surprise element during the climax is a thoughtful addition and cheers the audience, specially the female audience threefold. Though the film is not a sequel to Munna Bhai MBBS, Lage Raho Munna Bhai retains the characters of Munna and Circuit in the lead roles and their nontoxic, almost childlike idiosyncrasies. This idea also gives an unlimited scope for possibilities the hit pair of Munna and Circuit can indulge into in future. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is a story about Murli Prasad Sharma aka Munna who meets Mahatma Gandhi and undergoes a heart transformation. For Munna, breaking bones and abducting people at the snap of his fingers was easier than the courage it required to walk on the path of non-violence and truth. Hesitatingly and unwittingly he takes the road less traveled, which is thorny and full of obstacles in return for self revelation and a guilt-free conscience that fears nothing and no-one. The 'Gandhivad' is turned into 'Gandhigiri' by self proclaimed Professor Murli Prasad Sharma for its practical implementation in the present day, without sounding preachy or heavy-duty. There is a similar 'offering the other cheek' when someone slaps you, confessions of truth and also the 'satyagrah' for a bunch of old people who lose their house called 'Second Innings' to the manipulative and greedy Lucky Singh. Sad but true that our nation won freedom but lost its people, Murli tries to revive faith, courage, truth and justice in people from different walks of life. With his new found ideology or the chemical 'locha' in his brain, he triumphs over the cynics or the lost souls and also wins the love of his life. An interesting observation can be made between Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra's 'Rang De Basanti' and Rajkumar Hirani's 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai', the fact that though the theme of both films is more or less the same, the approach to resolving the conflict is in complete contrast with each other, like two ends of the same thread. Yet both films succeed in their own unique ways and deliberate the depths of human emotions and reflections in an identical manner. In the end, hats off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for producing a film that is a wholesome entertainer and succeeds in giving a heartfelt message in the times where films are made merely to fulfill the whims and fancies of egoistic filmmakers.-Nidhi Kathuria"
"""Lage Raho Munnabhai"" , the second film in the Munnabhai series and perhaps the most eagerly awaited movie of the year at least for the people who like meaningful cinema.This one was supposed to be a sequel but it has a story of its own and its refreshingly original and no connection with the first movie except the Munnabhai and circuit and their gang. I saw the movie and was completely spellbound by it.I was glued to the screen for the entire duration and enjoyed every bit of bit.To call this movie a comedy would be wrong this one is a mix bag you've got comedy, romance , emotions (and yes lots of them) and a beautiful script to tag along.The entire cast is simply lovable and all have acted their part to the book. Sanjay Dutt excels in the role of Munna hes is well complemented by ever smiling Arshad Warsi as circuit who surprisingly shows his softer side in some well acted emotional scenes. Vidya Balan looks fresh and acts her part well. Boman Irani as The Punjabi builder is first rate,people get to see the various shades of his character.The supporting cast of elderly persons is also good. Dia Mirza provides glamor to the film in a brief but sweet role. Jimmy Shergill is likable in the scenes where he gets footage.But the real star of the movie is ""RajKumar Hirani"" , yes the director of the movie. he has told the story in a very unique manner which appeals to the masses.I wont go into the details as it will spoil the fun but this man is a class apart, he has handled each and every scene with perfection be it comedy , emotional or drama brilliantly.Music is perhaps the only weak point of this film. Though the songs blend well with the story but no songs stands out to be a chart buster. The picturisation of the songs is beautiful and visually appealing.On the whole ""lage raho munnabhai"" is an excellent movie not to be missed. The movie will tickle your funny bone as well as bring tears to your eyes in some situations. Its unique way of story telling will find praises not only from the masses but from the critics as well. the movie has a surprise package in the character of ""mahatma Gandhi"" and the actor who's played the part suits the role wellI can't wait for another outing with Munna&Circuit but good things come at a price. The price here is Another Wait Till Then patience rakho ""MAAMOO""."
"To start of with i didn't had much of expectation on this movie since I assumed that a second series to Munna Bhai might not be good as the original based on my previous experiences. But this movie 'ROCKS' with a different story line all together, still keeping the characters of MunnaBhai(Sanjay Dutt)in place. The crew is pretty much the same from the original except for the heroine Vidya Balan and she does her part in style with others. The chemistry between Munna Bhai and Circuit, whether its comedy or sentiments was handled with beauty by Sanjay Dutt and especially Arshad Warsi. Boman Irani again proves that he can the best for the character given to him. Go watch this movie with less expectations and you will enjoy this weekend comedy treat.. This movie is sure shot a box office hit and movie for every Indian to watch!! Don't miss it because I bet u will come out with the satisfaction of watching an excellent movie with flawless script!! - Mobs"
"Now that i have visited the NEARBY single screen twice for LRM , it's about time to write a detailed review(quite a big achievement as it's 10 km away from my residence ,all thanks to the VVC-Multiplexes stand off).Half an hour into the film & i was thinking , WTH is happening ova here? I mean there wasn't any definitive motive behind munna's shenanigans but as we reach towards the intermission point , i was squeezed into a compromise.& the second half...well it delivers, delivers big time as munnabhai's ""Gandhigiri""does create a ""chemical locha"" in our hearts & how ! Hats off to Hirani, & abhijat Joshi for creating such memorable screenplay which makes u rethink about bapu's relevance today, it's just stuffed up with great scenes whether it's about a man trying to get rid of unwanted stains on his door courtesy his pan chewing irreverent neighbour or an old retired teacher trying to get even with a corrupt officer in pure Gandhigiri style , they all create such a huge impact on one's psyche.Arshad once again does a great job , on first viewing i founded him a bit OTT at times but the second session convinced me that his was a performance driven by astounding comic timing , well done circuit(though his screen time was a let down).Boman as Lucky was great too , sometimes his Punjabi lingo faltered but overall this definitely is his first notable outing post MMBBS.Vidya is good but her Guuuuuuudmorning mumbai does irritate u at times , still she was better than gracy .& then there is sanjay dutt without whom munnabhai can never be what it is today , such a heartfelt performance that it makes u weep & smile at the same time ,one of the rarest of rare feet i must say.It's amazing to see that how he swings from Zinda's maniac urgency to munnabhai's goofy charm ,all in all Yet another awesome outing for him .Easily the best film of the year , waiting for munnabhai's next innings and until then , Lage Raho Munnabhai.8.5/10"
"If you eat a good chocolate or sweet, the taste lingers in your mouth for quite sometime... right? Likewise, the taste of this movie lingers in you mind for quite some time! This movie is the best example of a brilliant script, brilliant execution and of course, some brilliant acting... Sanju and Arshad really rocks.... they make you laugh most of the time and there are some heart touching moments also... like in the first movie.. This movie surpasses its predecessor in every way.... The Mahatma angle in the movie has come out superb! Thank you Mr. Hirani for reminding us about Mahatma and his values... after a long time... :o) And lastly, i never thought that Vidya Balan would be so beautiful when I watched Parineetha then. She is very beautiful with radiant smile... Go watch it folks..."
"you have to understand folks that this is not an artistic film nor does it pretend to be an artistic film. it's really intended to be pure entertainment with a message. And that is why this movie accomplished these goals in mind. entertainment - entertainment - entertainment!i really admire the gandhi pacifist theme to this film. the acting was great throughout. great to see a movie with sanjay dutt as the top billed actor. sometimes you just want to see a common looking person and not an overtly handsome male lead like SRK or Salman or Saif Ali.Sanjay can really carry this movie with his acting. I loved his crying scene with gandhi - he was so believable. boman irani and vidya balan are just as great as he is. boman's body language in his character role was amazing. vidya balan is such a natural performer, she's better than meryl streep because her acting skills are more nuanced and less technical than meryl's. if you love movies then you'll love the spiritual quality of this movie with the ghost of gandhi popping in and out. the musical numbers are also fun but add more to the story by showing you how the characters truly feel about what is happening to them.KUDOS to Cinematography C. K. Muraleedharan and Director Rajkumar Hirani and Producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Screenplay by Abhijat Joshi is just brilliant. When Gandhi sits on the couch and says ""Why don't you just shoot Lucky?"" - I died laughing. These folks are the future of film and Adam Sandler/Will Ferrell/Jim Carrey need to take lessons from a movie like this in my humble opinion. I say Bollywood all the way!"
"Quite possibly, one of the top five Hindi movies of all time. Manages to provide a thoughtful perspective on fixing interpersonal problems with rip roaring comedy and great music. Comments on growing old with dignity, treating people with compassion, the pitfalls of astrological nonsense and ridiculous superstition, the hideous Indian bureaucracy, and any number of important social issues all interspersed with side splitting comedy sequences. While the acting is passable the credit goes the original story line and the empathetic, sensitive directorial skills of the wonderful Rajkumar Hirani. An absolute must see. Appreciating it requires some prior exposure to and acceptance of the Bollywood melodramatic, in your face story telling style."
"I did not dislike Munnabhai MBBS, neither did I love it¬Ö in my opinion it was OK, plenty of laughter and light moments, in fact a realization how much effect a jaadu ka jhappi can make to one's close people. The rare departure of a vasooli gangster to a kind hearted bhai is really adorable to watch, therefore I watched Lage Raho Munnabhai with no expectation at all, just keeping in mind the huge success and revolution it has made in India.I really respect the makers of LRMB for not trying to recreate any magic or moments of the MBBS prequel, neither did they bank on any aspect from the previous movie. In fact this was a fresh start for the characters and the whole storyline itself. With the success of this installation, I will not be surprised if Munnabhai turns out to be a famous franchise of Bollywood film industry, the first of its kind.The combination of Munnabhai and Circuit manage to churn out plenty of laughter, at the same time bring realization among the youngsters who seem to have forgotten their roots and history of India. This movie is not just applicable to Indian community, but also throughout the world where all of us have forgotten to appreciate small things in life and forget to do good to others. The whole execution of the storyline is admirable, as there is no bit of rona-dhona, overly emotional or drama involved, yet it manages to reach the heart of the viewers.The ending, is simply superb, one moment you might be feeling a drop of tear in your eyes, and the next moments its so funny, you just feel happy and fall in love with life. Watch it, otherwise its your loss."
"I haven't seen something so vibrant and refreshing and don't get me wrong, I'm only 14 but, I know a lot about Hindi Movies and this is one to brag about. I was laughing so hard I would hiccup and even during parts that you would think are only to be tense, Munnabhai and Circuit do the unbelievable and turn it into something that will make you tear...The other thing is that, although it may not impact anyone because it is a hard message to go by, the whole idea of the teachings of Mohindra Karamchod Ghandi being incorporated was a twist unlike any other. I'm going again this weekend and watching it again, the great thing is... I have hardly any remembrance of the movie because I was laughing so hard.Of course there are also things that weren't incorporated, like why Ghandi died... Of course it was a serious matter that couldn't be very much enlightened by the duo. Some say that his student was crazy and did it out of spite and jealousy. Others say that Ghandi deserved it because he agreed to help the British in their workings in order to get them to leave but, this is only because it was the peaceful way out...Now here are some points about this movie: - It is a hilarious spectacle that could rob you of all of your oxygen as you thrust out all the air in your body in reaction to the laughter.It has a lesson that you may want to ignore or may want to use, in American society it's useless because there are much different problems now then there are in India...I can't say much more than that it's the Kingda Ka of all roller-coaster rides that will be sending you twisting and turning as you work through this storyline.Thanks for reading, have a nice time watching it..."
"Every once in a while, there comes a movie which makes you feel good about yourself: suddenly, the possibility that we can all be better human beings becomes all so real, if only for the next two days. And then, when the feeling seems to be getting stale- movies after all are make-believe- you go again and watch that film. Over and over again.Frank Capra did it with Mr Smith Goes To Washington and The Lost Horizon. Spielberg worked that magic by reviving the child in all of us with ET. More recently, there was As Good As It Gets. But that's Hollywood. In European cinema, Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy stands out. Such films are rarer still in India, more so Bollywood. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand was definitely one such film. Now, after a gap of over three decades comes Lage Raho Munnabhai.I will not discuss the film here. But if you do not leave whatever it is you're doing and rush to the nearest cinema-hall near you, then you are really missing out on one helluva an experience.Remember: don't walk. RUN!"
"Big smile indeed...!if you thought ""Munnabhai "" was a hoot,this one goes beyond. Humour,compassion,loads of fun and romance...Acting,direction,editing and script are brilliant..! A must see... Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi bring this sincere,funny,heartfelt and lovable performance to the screen..script avoids getting preachy and does not waste any time.. Boman and Vidya are classy and very good creating a light but credible story... Music was a let down but may be will grow on me .. all in all,kudos to Hirani and Chopra to have the guts to pull it of... The audiences were in splits almost all the time and I have not enjoyed an Indian movie so much in a long,long time."
"Nice movie For the movie that teaches patience, it surely doesn't test ours right away, cuz thankfully it wasn't long like other so called big movies of the year. They kept it short and sweet. The movie was full of moments ... be it the laughters or the triumph of truth, both pleased the audience like a charm. The plot was intelligent to say the least as it carries a lesson in its comic theme. I don't know if any documentary on Gandhi could ever have an impact on such a mass audience; this one filled in a lot of trivia on Gandhi for me and it was truly inspirational. You can see some parallels to Rang De Basanti and quite ironically, these two seem to be the no.1 and no. 2 movies of the year.While it doesn't exceed the original Munna Bhai MBBS, it doesn't fall behind either. It does have its glitches and some weak script moments, but it can all be forgiven for its sheer brilliance and lively performances. You can't help but fall in love with Munna and Circuit; they just happen to create magic on the screen together. Vidya Balan plays her role well; she was very charming and outright adorable. Her 'Good Morning Mumbai' expression was cool. Boman Irani didn't have as meaningful role as the first one, but he did complete justice with it. He came out safe even playing the antagonist of the movie. The cameo trio of Jimmy Shergill, Dia Mirza and Abhishek were justified as well... well may be not Abhishek's role, but Dia Mirza added the glamor and Jimmy did his bit with one of the most sentimental scenes of the movie. The guy who played Gandhi deserves major props. The songs weren't forced and the cinematography is excellent ... the ""samjho ho higaya"" had excellent blends.Wow... didn't even realize i wrote that much... i guess i was bit impressed :)This movie is beyond the traditional comedies like Hera Pheri, Chup Chup K and Malamaal Weekly, it has bigger than life moments. Abhi tak parh rae la hai, watch it already ""Mamu... boley tou Abhi-ich make a plan to watch it"", you won't be disappointed. The government should applaud this movie and name some towns MunnaNagar and Circuitabad to honor it. Afterall, which other movie teaches such lessons and gives tributes to the nation's founding fathers."
"Alwaysly we have expected lots of laughing from this movie.Munnabhai MBBS and Lage Raho Munnabhai are 2 Different Films. Characters are same but it's whole new movie, new story.Munnabhai MBBS had lots of comedy and drama. This one has it too. I can say this one is actually better in terms of keeping you looking at screen without blink. Reason, You can tell that more than half of part in first movie was comedy and little after that was sensitive drama. This Movie has Both of it, but you can say which part wasn't funny or which part didn't have sensitive feelings. It is one perfect mixture of Comedy, Drama that deliverers a Moral for today's society.Sanjay Dutt needs no introduction. Arshad Warsi is at his Best. Munna & Circuit was hit and is super hit with this movie. Vidya Balan looks beautiful and has done her part best, so have other characters.Story is perfect, screenplay is perfect, direction, music...... everything is perfect. I am giving 9 from 10. Being Greedy for 1 Point as I wanted to see just little more of Munna & Circuit doing their Dadagiri Before Gandhigiri.This is must watch film."
"i saw this movie on its first day of release and would say that its one of the best movie of this decade, finally a movie is made in India which can make lots of Hollywood flicks cry on their knees. The plot, sub plot, screenplay and dialogues are amazing, apart from making Ghandhiji more great and meaningful the movie itself is very fine piece of art and entertainment, this movie is an answer to those who say that if u wanna make commercial cinema u have to compromise on certain things, but this movie is artistic as well as a commercial hit....... a must must watch if u are a true cinema lover........ the movie is as good as the first munna bhai movie and who says u cannot repeat the success of an original one??... huh... the performance of arshad warsi and sanju is excellent, they can beat chris tucker and jackie chan any given day....."
"This movie is a sequel to earlier movie ""munnabhai MBBS"" .As the earlier one was a complete entertainer and was framed on very emotional ground ,the new one is also based on certain values, emotion and feeling of life . This movie is not any tapori type but give insight to normal thinking of common people and also their problem. Director knows that if u want to teach the audience you have to have solid base and vidhu has made his ground with nation's father Mahatma Gandhi. one the one hand the storyline has been steady and binding through out on the other hand dialog delivery of each character has been kept near perfection. if i talk about anyone in the movie i must say sanjubaba is fantastic in his role as and in munna bhai. His presence in the movie is strengthened by his chelaram circuit . they seem to have good chemistry on screen and the same has worked in the movie. this movie is a complete family entertainer and anybody can go with the family to watch the movie. The concept of Mahatma meeting with munna bhai is good and giving other thought to the movie. you know i liked one more thing very much that is the way Vidya Balan pronounce gooood morningggggggggggggggggggggg mumbaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii this movie is summation of drama emotions feeling self respect and over above healthy entertainer must see movie for everyone"
"I just saw the first day first show of this sequel to Munnabhai MBBS and I must say that the team has come up with an excellent sequel !! The original title was supposedly Munnabhai meets Mahatma Gandhi but due to reverence or whatever reason, the new title has come up...the original title fits the movie like a glove... Munnabhai actually turns nonviolent and starts speaking only truth and also suggests several hapless humans of this new millennium to follow Mahatma's experiments with truth... The story with all its references to current changing scenario of the society is actually not interfering with the comedy that thrives in situations that our Munnabhai creates thanks to the affairs of the heart and the first half goes in a jiff without one realizing how time passed so fast !! actually, at interval time, I was feeling so fortunate to be watching such a great movie- first day first show !!!! the movie continued in the same vein in 2nd half too but the last twenty minutes robbed one star from the movie...it wasn't all that entertaining coming after such a rollicking 2 hrs that preceded it.. Nevertheless, highly recommended for people of all ages !! Sanjay Dutt lives the role and Arshad is not far behind either...Vidya looks good in modern dresses and is quite charming too...Boman, Jimmy, Dia all do justice to their roles as expected...music is good too...As a bonus, you get to see trailers of Don and Ekalaiva - both seem to be very interesting to say the least !!"
"So far best movie of this year, there were one or two scenes which I thought too much Drama, but I will ignore because overall the movie was damn good. And best thing I liked about this movie is, Its Original (IMO). Not a copy of any movie or some scenes stolen etc. etc. etc. .............. I might go for 2nd time again ;)My Review == 4.8 / 5 ( - 0.2 because of 2 scenes with too much Drama )Acting ............ All did very well and played their characters so dam goodMusic .......... You will like the songs more after watching the movie Direction .............. Excellent Story ........... Wow!! Recommend to others === 100 Times better than KANK or Krrish :) Go and Watch the movie and decide yourself.Bonus == Eklavya Trailer :) :) :)Waiting for 3rd Part, If they decided to make it and when ever it will release :)"
"I went to watch Lage raho Munnabhai without much expectations as sequels rarely live up to the original. But, to my surprise, I felt this movie was even better than the first. The first one being so popular, they could have easily extended that story for the sequel but instead they came up with this BRILLIANT idea of imagining Munna Bhai - Mumbai Don - being influenced by Gandhian thoughts. Not only was the Idea brilliant and novel, implementation was excellent too. The first half of the movie is a laugh riot with hilarious sequences of endearing Bhai-Circuit duo and extremely funny one-liners. Arshad Warsi again does a great job as loyal, lovable Circuit. In the second half, whenever movie seemed to drift a little, it came right back on track with Warsi's one-liners. While fully entertaining the audience with good comedy, the movie also puts across a good message - showing us how Gandhian thoughts can possibly be an answer to our everyday problems. Like the first one, this movie also wins the hearts of the audience, who are not only satisfied with brilliant comedy but also linger upon a heart-warming message."
"Here is a movie that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. A nation that proclaimed one of the most remarkable humanist of the last century as 'the father of the nation' at the euphoria of most unique mass-movement to gain independence from British colonial rulers -- erected Gandhi's statue everywhere, named every main street as Mahatma Gandhi Road, decorated every Government office with his portrait ... and in a feat of amnesia forgot all about the unique message of this 'half-naked fakir'. The director, Mr.Rajkumar Hirani had accomplished the masterly act of reviving Gandhi's timeless message in a humorous wrapper through underworld don Munnabhai (Sanjay Dutta) and his loyal lieutenant Circuit (Arsad Warsi) in contemporary Bombay bursting with cellphones, satellite radios with such acumen that will make you burst out laughing. But in the footsteps of great master Charlie Chaplin, Mr.Hirani is well aware of the art of humor -- as Munnabhai encounters every problematic situations -- be it eviction of senior citizens from '2nd Innings Home' by a greedy builder (Bommani Irani), or a young man who lost his father's savings in the quicksand of stock market or the bride-to-be with an unfavorable horoscope -- Gandhi advises him on strategies that are diametrically opposite of typical 'underworld strategies' rooted in violence. Gandhi tells Munnabhai that it requires more bravery to apologize than to commit violence or love is more powerful than hate. These moral messages come through in hilarious circumstances and never in a preachy manner -- again to establish the maturity of the director to assume a matured audience. The wave of progress is sweeping India -- and some quarters of the society worries the impact of such rampant changes on this old civilization -- but the artist like Mr.Hirani brings out the true power of Indian culture -- that always assimilated the foreign influence with a moral, non-violent, humanist message embodied in Mahatma Gandhi ."
"simply, fantastic movie. After so many days a great movie like this has been released and after so many days we laughed so much. The best part is no repeated dialog from the part 1. The emotional scenes are also very good. Thanks Raj and chopra ji for the gift. I think they are true assets of the nation. The combination of munna circuit and Lucky is really super. They have shown Gandhiji's character with great respect and some concern.I couldn't stop my tears in some scenes and immediately i laughed loudly for the next dialog.I have seen the movie by paying double in black in Bangalore and it is worth. I was even ready to pay more. I am very happy that my favorite Munna bhai has high demand. Waiting for the part 3."
"This is going to be the best comedy movie for the year .. I mean the team of Munnabhai has come up with such an interesting plot, that will keep you intact with the seat for a two and a half hour duration .. which believe me .. went in a whisker ! Everyone who acted in this movie have done justice to their role .. and I loved Circuit in this one more than the first .. Sanjubhai has given life to Munnabhai yet again in style ! The initial title which was 'Munna meets Gandhi' would have been more apt for this movie. At interval though the movie was very good, I just thought that its missing something called as a logic. But the director has tied the open ends very well in the second half giving me a reason to stop speculations ! On the whole, this is one hell of a movie I would recommend for you and your family .. Laugh out loud !"
"Movie is released today in Australia, its a dam good movie but with small gaps (which we can say away from munna bhai and circuit) ,most of the characters r same in the movie as of previous but totally different story( no relation with previous movie). Every one has done a good job and after this movie i m in love with Vidya Balan, she looks gorgeous. She has improved her acting to much as compared to Parinita. One last think thank good ""a nice relief from KANK "". A nice entertaining and lovable movie. Songs r good , some u can listen for no of times. I miss ""MAMU"" word , which is used very less in the movie.Overall i give 9/10"
"We live in a cynical world, but even in such times, sometimes a person, book or film comes along and shows you a tiny crack in the wall behind which there is a lot of light, and suddenly your heart is full of happiness.The music of the film seems okay when one listens to the album in isolation, but watching the film, the songs are exactly what the film needs, pleasant and soulful throughout with a background score that enhances them, using the sound scape of the songs itself. The cinematography and the production design complement each other and stay true to the film.Lage Raho Munnabhai is one such film that makes you laugh,makes you cry, and also makes you feel good to be a human being."
"For me the start of this movie was so cheesy I actually turned it off as after watching the first ten minutes or so I really didn't think it was something I'd enjoy. However, my wife and I decided to give it another go and we stuck with it and managed to get beyond the terrible opening and boy am I glad we did.As the movie progresses it just seems to get better and better in every way. The story unfolds in a magnificent way, the characters become less two- dimensional, and the message of the films shines through so brightly ... well, I won't say any more as I'll leave that for you to discover.After the first ten to fifteen minutes I would probably have given this movie 3 out of 10, but by the time the final credits rolled that had gone right up to a well earned 9 out of 10."
"A goon promoting the principles of Mahatma Gandhi - Sounds unusual and ironic, doesn't it? No big challenge for Raju Hirani who transports the viewer into the colorful world of Munna and Circuit. LRMB leaves you with a huge smile refusing to fade away alongside a number of beautiful lessons in a very enlightening manner. Munna and Circuit are small time goons who work for Lucky Singh. Munna is in love with Janvi and pretends to be a history professor and tells her he is a big follower of Gandhi to impress her. A turn of events leads Janvi to know Murli's truth. What happens next? Watch LRMB and find out.LRMB is one of those rare films that never lose steam. There's a perfect mix of comedy and emotions. Best of all, it has tremendous repeat value. Scenes to look out for? Too many but here's a few.The very first scene - Munna answering questions on radio - Munna's first meeting with Janvi - Scenes between Munna and Gandhi and especially the ones featuring Circuit. - Munna spreading Gandhigiri all over. - Munna's revelation on why he sees Gandhi. - ClimaxThose are just some of the moments not to miss. Actually, you really cannot afford to miss any. Music is okay but sounds much better in the movie. Situational like the last Munnabhai. The writing is nearly flawless and dialogue is applaud worthy. Just brilliant. They tear you up, either in laughter or emotions. Vidiya Balan is fantastic. Suits the role to the T. Boman Irani is first rate. Gives a fine act. Diya Mirza, Khulbushan Karbhanda is as always. Jimmy Shergill is good. Ditto for Surab Shukla.Special mention for Dilip Pravakar as Gandhi. He's terrific. Of Course the 2 goons steal the show on screen as Munna and Circuit. The acting, the chemistry, the delivery - just astounding. Brilliant act by both. Sanjay Dutt is born for this role and he does full justice. He's lovable. Arshad Warsi is at his best when he plays Circuit. He brings the house down with some of the best lines.The hero off screen is director Raj Kumar Hirani. Great execution and story telling by this gem of a director.Overall, a brilliant feel good entertainer worth watching unlimited times."
"This is bollywood.. Perfect blend of rib tickling comedy, sweet emotional moments, strong social message and a charming love story.There are few things (which cant be mentioned as flaw, but..) Songs are good but nt what i expected from it except d unique whistle tune of munnabhai. All the old peoples are introduced in initial scenes are not given to establish in remaining movie.. Whatever but these are just minute thingsTons of Positive things Superb screenplay, Good script, Perfect blend of mass and critic appealer. Superb chemistry between lead characters (of course i am talking abt Munna-Gandhi n Circuit) I can nt give it less than 9i keep mesmerizing Circuits ubique funny dialogue."
"An absolutely delightful movie, complete with possibly the world's most beautiful woman. My wife and I saw this movie in Jaipur while on holiday in India and, despite not understanding the language, we were able to follow the plot. Indeed there were tears in our eyes during some of the time. Music good and the dance ""dream"" sequences quite fabulous. I read that the movie has increased youth awareness of Ghandi and his beliefs which must be a big plus, I wonder if the producers will issue an English language version? It would be valuable if some of our Western Youth were able to learn a little of the thoughts of this great man. Meanwhile the film started with a really funny sequence which set the pace for a relaxed couple of hours of entertainment. A ""gotta see"" movie!"
"Don't really find Hindi movies funny, apart from Johnny Lever, But, this movie was just really funny!!Never really liked Sanjay Dutt so was not excited to see this movie at all, But this one is just so funny. Its Arshad (man in black T-shirt- Moorli's side kick) who makes the movie a real success. His timing and expressions keeps audience wishing there are more scenes with him. I had tears when Gandhi appeared giving this movie a very serious message, about loving people and standing up and being counted even when its so obvious you are fighting a losing battle and about truth. Very thought provoking movie and movie that will spark discussion. Its about time that a movie like this was made.Something for everyone.Gandhi- long may you live in spirit!!"
"This is really great movie I have seen in a very long time. Very well written and well made. I had never thought Bollywood would have some people who can think and produce such outcome.The movie is all about Gandhi's principles and those executed by a gangster called Munnabhai. The finest performances by Sanjay Dutt, Vidya balan and Arshad Warsi take this movie to the next level. The film is very funny and you can not stop laughing for 3 hrs. The movie also has a very good message which most of the bollywood movies lack.Arshad Warsi truly deserves a National Award for his performance. The real hero of this movie is Rajkumar Hirani the director of the film. I really feel that movie should go to Oscars as official entry from India."
"Incredible movie, an eye opener and a ready reckon. Don't know when do I have seen such a wonderful movie, which directly affects the ill practices of the society. If you ask my I would give 9 out of 10. One may ask why not ten, this is because Sanju 'baba' doesn't seem to be 'baba' now at this age. Come on boss he is grown up now. His growing age is visible all through the movie in spite of the heavy make-up he has put on. No doubt he is a wonderful actor, but his characters at this stage of his career shall be commensurate with his age, say elder brother, uncle etc. I liked his movie 'Mission Kashmir'. It was an outstanding movie with his excellent acting.However there is a big question ahead should we, taking lessons from the movie act in the same way and make people asking for bribe ashamed in front of the society or should we not do anything at all and just accept it as normal practices as it is now. The bigger question is even if we adopt the lessons from the movie how much will the stubborn, corrupt bureaucracy who are neck-dipped with all kind of ill practices will be ready to take the challenge and change for the better. Overall a good movie to be seen at least twice."
"Its not fictional and its not real but a very good movie with lots of humor and fun. When i say its not real, i mean to say that the way Muna solve everyones problem is a correct way to do but it doesn't happen in real life and the scene when he sees Ghandhiji. But the movie doesn't deal with this, it deals with comedy which has been portrayed in a wonderful way. I must say its not like other comedy movie. This movie is the best movie so far to me and i am preety sure it should be for others to coz it is. Krish has been the biggest grocer of the year so does Fanna. If the movie like Fanna can create huge box office, Definitely Lage Raho Munabhai should. The movie that i liked so far in 2006 are RDB, Phir Hera Pheri and Kank. I must say lage Raho Muna bhai is far better than this all.Good work by Sanju and Warsad"
"Death of Hrishhikesh Mukherjee marked end of an era in Bollywood, but with Lage Raho Munnabhai, it seems there is someone who wants to keep the tradition alive. Mr Hirani, with this movie, is all set to prove that viewers still love movies without ""Item Numbers"" and ""Skin Show"". This movie comes at time when everyone is going ga ga over ""Rang De Basanti"" and Mr Hirani dares (rather, makes a sincere effort) to convey exactly opposite message of what was conveyed in RDB. I bet, everyone will agree that he is successful. Confidence and excellence of this director is proved by fact that it was not an easy job to put ""Gandhian"" morals in mainstream commercial bollywood cinema. For viewers, this movie has in store a very fresh script, complimented by excellent direction, music and most importantly editing. Though the story is very much predictable, but it is overcome by powerful direction. This movie makes you go emotional and smile at the same time¬Ö. Munna saying sorry to circuit is one such powerful scene. All the scenes of so called ""gandhigiri"" by Sanjay Dutt are very well shot. Though the director has used few jokes and scenes from Munnabhai MBBS, but he knows his limits and makes sure that the repetition is not irritating the viewers. Viewers still enjoy same old jokes. In today's world, when even Gandhiji would have given second thought to his ideology (no offense meant) here is a director that conveys them out loud and in a manner that everyone enjoys the same. All said and done, the movie has its flaws, Boman Irani and Vidya Balan's characters provided little scope to showcase the acting talents. Overall a wholesome entertainer. Though the director may not change the world, but at least when you are watching movie, he succeeds in making you believe that ""Gandhian"" ideology works in modern world too."
"Bole to Apna Bhai Fir Se Waapis Aa Gela Hai Re Maamu!! and to say the least with the same glamor, style, fun and sentimental heart... I dunno whether Bollywood produced such a good sequel before... but this one is really as good as part one if not better... Movie starts with the same type of scene as it started in first part... just to remind u of offbeat tactics and offbeat character of Munnabhai!! First half makes u roll on your seats with laughter... u just cant help... Murli Prasad Sharma and Cirkeshwar in their old form... though sometimes u notice Cirkeshwar is more sophisticated than the previous movie.. but as movie progresses u stop noticing differences and just enjoy whatever u watch... Second half starts with slow scenes and u start wondering whether all the hard work in first half is gonna perish as in all the Bollywood movies... but then movie catches up after some time... and u are given small doses of laughter in every scene whether sentimental or serious... I find songs good, fit to the occasion and choreography really innovative specially Samjho Ho Hi Gaya... where song is shot in a single Gulli!!! wonder why Yashraj Needs those costly foreign locations... Creativity beats everything... Gandhi.. a difficult subject to handle for anyone... but director shows his maturity and u never have overdose of HIM!!! all in all a good watch... have fun ride people... and wish Best of Luck to Munna and circuit for their all future adventures...wish Circuit would have got more lines... but then doesn't matter because we always expect more than what we get..."
"When I went To see this movie, i had a lot of questions in my mind. Will it be good? Will it'll live up to its expectation? How will be the acting? etc etc. But when I saw this movie, I was simply moved by its Storyline.Its a fresh story, from scratch. (So don't Confuse yourself when U'll see Boman Irani as a Punjabi Fellow.) So Out goes Gracy Singh and in comes Vidya Balan. She did a fantastic role as a RJ. Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi are simply Superb!! No comments could actually describe their performance.This movie has lots of surprises, catchy lines, and not to forget a very good moral for todays world. Make it a note to watch this Great Movie. Hats off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra."
"Munnanagar and Circuitabad are back on the screen and they are ready to remind us about history, but in Gandhigiri style. Without being overly preachy, and employing the unique style of Munnabhai and his ever dependable circuit, the movie manages to teach us some Gandhian way of life. The movie is not a continuation of the previous movie, it just places the characters in a new setting. While performing his usual duties of evicting tenants and kidnapping, Munnabhai falls for a radio jockey, Jhanvi. To impress Jhanvi, he assumes the role of a professor who follows Gandhian principles and must give a lecture on Mahatma Gandhi. Only this time, it Mahatma Gandhi himself who comes to Munnabhai's rescue. It turns out he is the only one who can see Mahatma Gandhi. However, the situation gets complicated when a builder Lucky (Boman Irani) wants to evict Jhanvi.Sanjay Dutt literally walks through the role of Munnabhai. Arshad Warsi continues to impress in the role as Circuit. It would be worth checking out Taleban Express. He has very good facial expressions. Vidya Balan was refreshing, but I just wished that see would not keep saying ""Good Morning Mumbai"". It was enjoyable to watch Boman Irani, but you do miss the smiling ma-mu.Then there is more of Munnabhai Circuit Banter. Munnabhai: Circuit, if we go back to the village, how will you work, u do know to plough? Circuit: If I start ploughing, what will the bull do? I wish there was more of that. That is the main reason why we should be watching this movie.A welcome relief from KANK. Lago Raho Munnabhai"
"I give it a 6.5/10 because the movie is one of the best bollywood movies to come out for a long time - why? - Because it has some great acting, nice clean comedy & it teaches some good values to people, something that is sorely lacking in today's world.Having said that, I see that the rating of this movie is 8.8 and I'm pretty sure the bollywood faithful are responsible for it. If you think about the movie from an international perspective, it lacks imagination - it is yet another of the typical bollywood movies - silly singing & dancing & no novelty (except that the central character sees Gandhi, which had a good twist). The central characters are happy to be uneducated goons, the people who are powerful are also uneducated & corrupt and this reality is what is depressing about the country and I find it hard to enjoy. When is bollywood going to make a Sci-fi like Jurassic Park or a drama like Crash or Brokeback mountain or a modern Martial arts classic like Ong-Bak so that it can truly challenge the international movie arena. I don't see that happening anytime in the next century.In the meantime its going to be churning out millions of similar movies like Lage Raho ... every year only for stagnant people to rate it 8.8/10!"
"Munnabhai MBBS was a Fabulous movie that was very entertaining. Looking at the trailer and storyline i assumed the Second Munnabhai will not bee as good. I was wrong, I absolutely Loved the second one much more then the first. There is plenty of humour with mature comedy, with lots of heart warming scenes mixed with serious issues providing High Class Entertainment. Sanjay Dutt is Superb yet again portraying the lovable Good hearted Goon. Arshad Warsi is fantastic as the loyal sidekick, He is brilliant in almost every scene. My Favourite Scene has to be when Munnabhai and Circuit hug and make up, a very heart warming scene. Vidya Balan is alright i guess although her voice is a little annoying when she repeatedly says Good morning Mumbai! Boman Irani is great just like the first. Jimmy is hardly there and could of been deleted out. Diya Mirza looks Sexy and was perfect. This is a FANTASTIC MOVIE and deserves to win awards."
A brilliant movie. Must see for all and learn how the indian Psyche is tuned to gandhigiri
"Love and being good always triumphs, although these values don't always work in the real world they work beautifully in Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Chemistry between the leads is great, Sanjay Dutt, Vidya Balan, Asrad Warsi, and Boman Irani knock it out or the park and the lesson to be a good person and triumph is endearingly told. Songs are better than the first movie IMHO. Worth the watch"
"This movie is quite enjoyable, you will enjoy the timing of comedy and punches. The use of radio as a powerful medium in this movie is good effort. The faith in principles of Gandhi can lead you some place where you can be a good person."
"""Lage Raho Munna Bhai"" is a sequel to ""Munna Bhai M.B.B.S."" and it's a rare case where I actually prefer the sequel to the original. Part of it might be the lesser use of annoying language like 'bro' and 'dude' but mostly I think it's because the story is a bit deeper and FINALLY Munna Bhai does manage to reform!Just like in the previous film, Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt) is a nice mobster...an odd oxymoron, I know. However, he IS a mobster and uses his best friend, Circuit, to break a few legs and use a few bullets to get Munna's point across to his 'clients'. However, a big change in this installment is that Munna is smitten with a radio talk show host. Although he's never seen her, he's infatuated with her...and is excited when he hears that a contest she is hosting will allow the winner to meet her. But, the quiz is about Gandhi...and dopey Munna knows nothing about the man. So, he and Circuit kidnap some professors and use them to help him win the contest. Not surprisingly, when Munna wins, his lies keep racking up and soon he's talked himself into delivering a lecture on Gandhi to the host's housemates. So, a sociopath is supposed to be talking about Gandhi's non-violent methods....it sounds impossible. But, fortunately, Munna soon gets the help of a friend...the invisible ghost of Gandhi himself!! How will this change Munna for the better? See the film.I was a bit shocked at the premise of the film, as many hold Gandhi in almost god-like esteem and having him in a comedy seemed odd to say the least. However, the filmmakers did a good job of this and kept infusing Munna with not only the words of Gandhi but his philosophy in order to balance the comedy with drama and poignancy. A thoroughly enjoyable film in every way.By the way, the small role of Sunny is played by Abhishek Bachchan-- -a mega-star of Indian cinema and I was surprised to see this guy in such a tiny part of the movie."
"well till yet i have seen many movies but this one of those movies that touch my heart. In this movie we have so many things to earn in a fun way. The music is excellent, like the music which is remake of wande mataram shows how Gandhi JI was. So I recommend every one to see the movie ones in there life."
"""Kitne aadmi the"", ""Mogambo Khush Hua""; these epoch - making dialogues were from different directors. But once in a lifetime, it happens that ""Jaadu ki Jhappi"" and ""Gandhigiri"" coined by the same man get popularized and that too back to back. Bravo Mr. Hirani!!! If the faith healer worked in Munnabhai, ""Gandhi"" worked for Lage Raho Munnabhai. Keeping the basics i.e. comedy intact, Hirani changed everything. I think this is the beginning of the new age sequel pioneered by Hirani. It is so similar yet so different. Witty dialogues, well written screenplay, good comic timing, and well thought about characterization. Everything is so common. The only uncommon element is the plot and the backdrop. It's the screenplay, all the scenes just flow and are well knitted. Nothing is enforced. Our Munnabhai falls for Jhanvi, Vidya Balan who is a radio jockey. Vidya has a good screen presence and amazing dialogue delivery. The quiz contest on Gandhi, Murli Prasad aka Munnabhai winning the contest and his eventual entrance to the Mahatma Gandhi Library, are all very situational.Sanjay Dutt reading n number of books on Gandhiji is a bit indigestible, probably that's the reason Gandhiji comes out of the pages and that too without spectacles!!! I was kidding¬Öever saw Gandhiji without Spectacles? It's same as Sanjay Dutt with Books!!! Jhanvi arranges a lecture on Gandhiji for her grandfather and his friends at their place fondly called as the second innings home. Munnabhai being the professor and Gandhiji, one man rescuer.It was at the second innings home that their feelings get mutual. Here is the entry of the cunning Sardar Lucky Singh!!! Boss what characterization!He looks very convincing as the greedy builder. It's him that moves the story ahead as he sends them to Goa and takes possession of the second innings home through Munnabhai's right hand Circuit. I must say that Circuit just steals the show. He has developed himself as an actor with great coming timing. In spite of repetition of the same character, he has managed to make people roll out of their seats. It's the powerful performance of the character that makes you feel the need of a Circuit in your life!! Jimmy Shergill and Diya Mirza do justice to their respective roles. The phone-in programme on the principles of Gandhiji is a brilliant idea, very original. ""Gandhigiri is in full swing"".Gandhiji tried to be preachy but the presence of people like Circuit and Lucky Singh diluted the effect making it a film with a vision. The show leaves you with nothing but a smile on your face and the theater buzzes with Pal, Pal, Pal¬ÖPal Har Pal¬Ö"
"2006 was a year of sequels,starting with PHP,KRISSH both blockbusters LRMB was a sequel to Munnabhai Mbbs and a surprise blockbuster. In a way it's like a series not continued from part 1 except Munna and Circuit characters. The film which was earlier titled Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi is superb, it mixes comedy,emotions,drama all superbly. The Munna-Circuit scenes are throughly too good, Munna-Jhanvi(Vidya) romance too is good while Boman Irani's track too is well handled, At times things do get melodramatic,Also the Satyagraha track does seem a bit overdone but yet things are superbly handled, the scenes of Jimmy-Parikshit Sahni and the entire astrology part is superb. The end too is simply hilarious.Direction is superb by Rajkumar Hirani Music is decent, yet the songs Aane Chaarane,Title song,Pal Pal all are goodSanjay Dutt is yet again brilliant though looking out of shape, he is the only actor who can play such roles with ease. Arshad Warsi too is born to play Circuit, he is simply brilliant and in fact he is better then his previous act in Munnabhai, in fact he stands tall throughout. Vidya Balan is good, Dilip Prabavhalkar is good as Gandhi Boman Irani is superb though his role comes too close to Khosla Ka Ghosla, Khulbushan Kharbanda,Saurabh Shukla are good Jimmy Shergill is superb,Parikshit Sahni is good too Dia Mirza is superb, rest are all good"
"That is what I thought when watching this film. I have never watched a Bollywood film before but judging on the shorts snippets I have seen of such films, in TV-programs etc, this must be a far way from the ordinary Bollywood film. Actually I am convinced that a similar plot could easy become a successful Hollywood film. All the elements are there. There is the unhappy crook who falls in love, and to get his girl he has to pretend he is something he is not. There is the crook's comical and not to bright side-kick who supports him through thick and thin. There is the pretty and intelligent girl. And there is the ancient wisdom, here manifested in the holy Mahatma.And then there is the typical life-changing plot. The crook tries to become a better man and at the same time succeeds in making the world a better place.Yes I really liked it. There were a couple of musical numbers that I thought were well made and made sense. And the acting, writing and directing were all professional. Several times I laughed out loud at the comical points."
"Anyone familiar with Bollywood can be forgiven for reading the title of this review and not being particularly impressed - Bollywood has produced some profoundly horrible films in awe-inspiring quantities in the past.But Lage Raho Munnabhai sets aside all of the usual complaints one has about Bollywood. Its plot is in no way ripped off of something from Hollywood - indeed, it would be hard to come up with something more uniquely Indian. The songs, while ridiculous in a way that only Bollywood can achieve, are not so far gone as to be irredeemable and are actually well integrated into the plot. Finally, while the central motivating force for the plot is a typical Bollywood impossible love, the actual theme of the film is far deeper. True, the movie carries about it a certain absurd quality in everything from dialog to editing, such does nothing to detract from the power of the message.The plot, in short: Mumbai mobster Munna falls in love with a radio jockey, but to impress her pretends to be a professor who specializes in Mahatma Gandhi. In the process, he is forced to learn Gandhi's philosophy, causing a ""chemical imbalance"" in the form of Mahatma Gandhi's ghost who compels him to solve his problems with peace and truth.Though the main factor of this movie is comedy, at which it succeeds quite well (Circuit is far better characterized and thus far more lovable than in Munnabhai, M.B.B.S.), what I took away was a shaking awe of this man we call Mahatma. Though its exposition of his philosophy is a bit more modern/ridiculous than what the Mahatma practiced, it nonetheless accurately conveys the sheer courage of satyagraha. A mobster, someone accustomed to killing and being killed, is forced to acknowledge that real courage comes in taking a blow rather than fighting back. The movie's implication is that our modern society believes only the insane would follow in the path of Gandhi, yet watching it makes one wish more of our leaders today had ""chemical imbalances."""
"I thought that now that Sanju Baba has been convicted I need to prod myself to write a comment on this film. I hated Munna Bhai MBBS so I was resisting this one for the longest time. But the actual viewing turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I actually liked the film. It was repetitive and not very funny but it had its moments and it did achieve some of what it set out to do - bring front and center the fact that we live by completely different rules these days and wouldn't it be nice to change that. Sanju Baba was quite good as Munna Bhai, Boman Irani was awesome as his boss, Vidya Balan was adequate as the DJ, the entire assemblage at second innings house was great, but the show-stopper no doubt was Arshad Warsi as Circuit. The man is awesomely talented and made Munna Bhai a decent and watchable film.If you believe in Gandhian philosophy you might get upset at this new version called Gandhigiri. If the message is to twist Gandhian ideals into a new more menacing avatar then that is a scary thought. But if the film is really just poking fun and not trying to be very serious then you can chill and watch it without too much trouble. The thing is, I am not sure what the film is trying to do. However, it does bring back into notice the Mahatma and his life - so it does achieve some useful purpose. Afterall - Bande me thaa Dumm, Bande Mataram."
"Easily the most loved ""dynamic duo"" in today's cinema world, Munna Bhai and his sidekick, Circuit are back! And this time, they come together in the sequel of the fame hit to Munna Bhai MBBS is Lage Raho Munna Bhai.It's a normal day for this happy go lucky duo. The love interest this time is Vidya Balan as a Radio Jockey. The radio jockey idea seems obvious with the hit of Priety Zinta as the RJ in Salaam Namaste, and also keeping in touch with the recent trend of radio coming into vogue again, this time with a bang.The basic idea behind Munna Bhai is the same, mistaken identity and doing crazy things to keep the girl interested in him¬Ö this time, however, Munna does not go to college as a student (thank god). Jahnvi (Vidya Balan) mistakes Munna for a history professor! The Movie carries on where it left, lots of fun, extremely witty and not to forget ¬ñ humor with a message - with Jahnvi testing Munna's ""historical interests"".This is not just another movie in the park - I don't want to spoil the surprise, but, here is a spoiler: Gandhi playing a ""role"" in the movie, there are some interesting moments.With a twist in the run of events, the movie proves how contemporary the Gandhian values are.The Songs are not what you might call chart busters, with Kabhi Alvida na Kehna topping every music channel in sight, but songs are a luxury anyway in this wonderful movie.Investing money in watching this movie will pay you rich dividends ¬ñ laughter, fun and extreme satisfaction! There are apprehensions over the prices of cinema tickets, but this movie makes you sigh and gives you value for money From student to teacher, Munna has most definitely graduated and come of age! Arshard Warsi is too good once again¬Ö They say sequels are not so successful as the first movie, but this movie shall be the path breaking movie breaking that theory! Lage Raho indeed! Aptly named!"
"It's a perfect bled of all important ingredients of a fabulous movie.If you don't rate this movie 9 + the some wrong with your sense of humor! Any age group it's a must watch.It's also got a great message, which has faded in time. It makes you think yet does not stress you. Depicts some important aspects in life in a jovial way. Sunjay Dutt and Arshad Warasi have done a great job again proving the 2nd squeal can be better than the first one. The humor is great and it appears natural on screen unlike other comedy movies where in comedy is drilled in.Thanks to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Rajkumar Hirani for making a film that is more than just a rip-roaring comedy. It makes you laugh, makes you cry and make you think ."
"Lage raho munnabhai.....what to say about this movie.I think this is the most positive & optimistic movie ever made in Indian cinema.Its not a movie showing life of Gandhi and his principles but tells you how these principles can be practically implemented to solve some very common problems like corruption.......using gandhigiri.This movie is a good blend of comedy,emotions and of course gandhigiri.Everybody has done good acting especially Arshad Warsi.I am sure after watching you will never forget this movie.If faced by situations shown in the movie,in real life, you will always be guided by their solutions as shown.So do not just watch this movie for entertainment but also try to take the message it gives............."
"This is the first Bollywood film I have seen, and I enjoyed it very much. The story was funny, romantic, and even contained a strong moral lesson. The actors all seemed to do a good job -- it is harder to judge with a subtitled film. The songs were generally well done and not too intrusive. The cinematography, costumes, and set design enhanced the film -- and made me want to visit India some day. About the only suggestion for improvement would be to shorten it a bit -- this was at least 30 minutes too long for a comedy/musical, in my opinion. One technical gripe about the DVD: the commercials at the beginning were too long and unable to skip."
"This was a great movie. It was funny and entertaining, yet weaved a strong and very needed message through out the movie. It was great to see a movie that was able to entertain yet remind us of history and the message we may forget. I admired how the many different threads of this movie i.e. music, comedy, and history were brought together so well. Being American and having to read the sub-titles didn't take anything away from this movie for me. I was very moved by this movie, and would recommend it for every one to see. Sanjay Dutt being so handsome is an added plus in watching this movie ..wink..Labiba"
"This has got to be one of the most inspiring films made in the Indian Film Industry in the last decade. The other films I can think of are 'MunnaBhai MBBS', 'Hydrabad Blues' and 'Nayak'. Though HB was an independent effort. The script of LRMB is too good. When Boman Irani says ""Get Well Soon Munna"" it struck me so hard. The whole plot is in loops. Taxi driver and running bride already have a connection from the previous scenes. The script may not be air-tight but its definitely very well edited and has imaginative loops. Although the backdrop of the film is love story it actually is a social drama. Beautiful!!! The concept that Gandhiji only answers questions Munna already knew was just too much. That shows how tight and well thought out the plot actually is which looks like a regular comedy.Boman Irani is very good. Sanjay Dutt is convincing. Vidya Balan is just cute smiles. She was much better in 'Hum Panch'. Kulbhushan Kharbanda is great as usual. Arshad Warsi walked away with the glory this time. No doubt. He got the best lines and every time he got the home run. Dilip Prabhavalkar was also very convincing considering the kind of job he had to do. Theatre and films are two different medium. I will definitely see him on stage now. Diya Mirza has improved. Jimmy Shergil was also very impressive. It was nice to see Parikshat Sahni after so long. Although casting says three names in the writing department but we know for a fact that the brain behind this fantastic film is Rajkumar Hirani. Great Job. Must have been a journey for a sound editor in 'Hero Hiralal' to direct a film after 15 years and that too 'Munnabhai MBBS'. There are so many fantastic scenes in this film but my favorite is when lawyers beat up Gujju lawyer Dhansukh Bhai Patel. It's a very positive effort with many social messages. The most important things about the film are that it is very modern, talks about real issues with humor and is not preachy. 9/10"
"To deliver such a movie in present times with such a powerful message is truly commendable. The movies starts of on a slightly trite note but later flowers into a movie with high impact. The best part about the movie is that it is presented in a way that most common people can relate to it.. It is this quality that has propelled the movie to such acclaim. This is the sort of movie that showcases the true spirit of India and its father, Mahatma Gandhi.In times when its considered sissy to not have an ""eye for an eye"" this movie breaks all trends and goes back to good old days.its hard to describe the sort of reactions its produced in India for real. May it suffice for me to say that a lot of incidents or rather the methods used to achieve the goal in a larger sense, have actually started bearing fruit.Kudos to the director for making such a movie in present times. Though the movie has done exceeding well, it also ran the serious risk of bombing at the box office. By opening himself to possible criticism and still sticking to his guts, the director has done justice to the movie as well as its message. God bless."
"The most awesome film i have seen for a long long time.the way raju hirani has carried his story is unbelievable.if you thought m.b.b.s was awesome,wait till you see this film.the trailers didn't do justice to the film's content.i would have never believed it could be this good,until i saw it.its hard to imagine what the film holds in the second half,but i bet it is better than most of us could imagine.the way this film has inspired us Indians has to be seen to be believed.its impact can be seen in our politics as well.sanjay dutt has got what he needed to be remembered as one of the all time greats. all hail Munnabhai."
"Much of awaited of sequel finally arrived in the town. Thou,very few sequel gave big box office hit, LRM is one of them. LRM is worth watching movie of BOLLYWOOD. It is having full of comedy, Gandhi GIRI, love,friendship. I mean everything in life that one should at least have. Circuit's comedy was fantastic. Few comments by him during movies awesome.He is the best in the industry for comedy role. All the characters in this movie have done absolutely perfect job. The comedy and Gandhi GIRI are captured in a artistic way. Thou aged, Sanjay Dutt best fits for romance movie, he proved all. Simply, worth watching 100 times."
"I thought this movie was excellent! It literally brought tears of joy to my eyes. I recommend this movie to anyone. It really doesn't matter if you have seen the first movie or not. Even though this is a sequel, it doesn't have a continuing storyline. But that doesn't matter at all. The plot in this movie is awesome. The story, the best I have seen in a Hindi movie. But if you don't want to see the movie, don't. No one is forcing you. My favorite part was the Munna/Circuit apology. It was so deep and emotional. I can't tell you how much I loved this movie because I will keep repeating myself and that is kind of what I am doing so I can take up these minimum of 10 lines that i need. But seriously though, watch the movie. It will be worth your time."
"Really good Hindi comedies are few and far between. Lage Raho Munna Bhai is by far one of the best in recent times. You will laugh till your sides ache, and you will be forced to think about truth and non-violence on your way back to reality. The movie starts with a music that will tell you it is a sequel to Munna Bhai MBBS, but goes off as an independent story, with only the main characters (Munna Bhai, Circuit and the other ""dhobis"") coming back. Boman Irani is in this ""sequal"", but in a totally different role, to which he does justice AND MORE.The story is woven well, the music is hummable and meaningful (something which Hindi films lack a lot), the choreography is pleasing, the directing is wonderful and the acting is superb. Boman Irani (Lucky Singh) and Arshad Varsi (Circuit) steal the show, and Sanjay Dutt (Munna) and Vidya Balan (Janvi) are not far behind.Even when the plot gets a little ""serious"", the film holds the audience (this is what Hindi films mostly mess up).After you have watched it once and laughed a lot, watch it again: there will be bits and pieces of comedy and thought-provoking dialogue and actions to notice the second time, which will make sense.This is a movie to treasure. I hope more movies like this hit the screens."
"Laugh your way through this film and for sure it starts a chemical locha in ur dimag. This could well be the dawn of a new age bollywood film making, the script is crisp so is the direction. A must watch for its realistic approach to the modern day issues but with a Gandhian Flavour aka Gandhigiri. If bollywood has to get recognition at the global level, it should try churning out movies of this calibre, which not only showcases Indian Values of truth and ahimsa, but also the need of the modern age to embrace them. Hats off to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Rajkumar Hirani, for giving back Bapu to India. Excellence is stamped all over the film as it smoothly sails from one frame to another. It leaves us with a thought to reconsider and rediscover the ideals of Father Of India, Mahatma Gandhi. The Ideals are as relevant today as then."
"After a long time I have seen a movie that is entertaining as well has some good values. Most Hindi flicks play to the masses - so does this one. But the biggest difference is that it carries a powerful message. The best part is that I was not bored for a single moment in this movie. The songs are pretty good and the director has done a great job of editing the movie.Actingwise, Sanjay Dutt and Boman Irani are good, but the best part is played by Arshad Warsi. His dialogue delivery and facial expressions are a treat to watch. Even a stupid joke appears funny when Arshad Warsi delivers it. All in all, kudos to the movie team. Great job guys and I hope more Hindi film makers take to making movies that are fun and carry a message instead of the same love stories."
"enough has been said already about how good or the thoughtful the movie is, so wont repeat that here.The only disappointment was the title itself. The name gave me the impression of some real commercial, laugh-n-forget a typical Hindi movie and came out wondering what a great innovative plot to make a movie on. solid thoughtful storyline and yet very comical !!a very clever job by the director/writer to convey Gandhiji message in a simplest possible way. Arshad Warsi is hilarious. Sanjay dutt looks old at times. director could do a better job in portraying these 2 as don, esp in Mumbai real estate market."
"what can you say about this movie, i have seen it so many times now and i still luv this as much as i did the first time. You become so involved with the movie it makes you think you're actually with them. The comedy is just as promising as its pre-quel.Moving on to the cast well Munna bhai isn't complete without Sanjay Dutt, and where would he be without Arshad Warsi aka Circuit, the comedy pairing is so perfect. this is the second movie i have seen with Vidya Balan casted and i have to say she is just as perfect in the role of Janvi, minus the ""good morning mumbai"" which became fairly annoying.This is definitely a movie to watch u will be laughing through out as well as understanding the message the movie portrayed.I wont go into the details but its worth a watch. So please if u get the chance I'm sure you'll love it."
"After watching Munna Bhai MBBS I was impressed , Sanjay Dutt could after all do much better than beating up gangsters . Arshad Warsi , now there was a guy who always acted well and I always felt bad when his movies didn't do well . After watching his performance as Munnabhai's faithful sidekick Circuit , I was more than impressed .In this movie , all goes well till our Munnabhai falls in love with this radio jockey girl. Now he has to give a lecture on Mahatma Gandhi to win her love. He studies hard , really hard and guess who he sees right there , all set to help him . Its none other than Mahatma Gandhi himself.Munnabhai , being a small time mob owner , goes about his own ways with his life trying to solve his problems his own way. But its Gandhi ji who shows him the correct path . The path which might not always be the easiest , might not always be the quickest ,might not always be the obvious one but would always be the right one and if that path is followed , then victory is inevitably yours.This movie shows the poor state of mind that our generation might be in , the people for whom Gandhi is another statue in the park or another framed picture on the walls of government offices in which the corrupt officers demand bribe or refuse to do what they are paid salaries for .Different people have different opinion about Gandhi. Even during his time there many who didn't find his ways useful and have shown equally good results like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose who believed in Tit for Tat . Inspite of the difference in opinions they both had lots of respect for each other. It just depends on what a person believes in.The director has used a method , never before used , to show that ways shown by Gandhi are still as much valid now as they were 50 years ago. What Gandhi taught was no rocket science. It was what our conscience would tell us to do if we actually have the time to ask it . It shows that there is a Gandhi in all of us , the Gandhi who keeps us honest , the Gandhi who would show us the right path , the Gandhi who makes us sacrifising and helpful , the Gandhi who gives us the power to stand up for what is right .I am not a very sentimental kind of a person but I got to admit , this movie made me laugh as much as it made me cry . It is no doubtedly one of the best movies I have watched.I think that this movie was even better than the first Munna bhai movie and I hope there are many more of these intelligent movies to follow."
"It is the greatest Movie of the century. It is the height of Man's intelligence of story telling.If Movie ""Gandhi"" got so many Oscars, this movie ""Lage Raho Munnabhai"" deserves 10 times more Oscars.Gandhism is very intelligently communicated to the mass through "" Gandhigiri"".There is an element of psychology in the movie. But, that is how this whole universe works on principles of belief.We should take this as an intelligent way of the director, to communicate with the viewers.""Gandhigiri"" is the only future for India, through which it can win the world, not by high tech software, or high rise buildings. This is the only principle, which will cleanse India of all corruption and cheap politics.Vittal Belandor, Bangalore"
"Munna (Bhai Lage Raho).Teri to.. Teri to Chandi ho gayi re baap! Muuna, you acted like a mature teacher, and re-loaded a theme into the minds of people which was forgotten..You really emerged as a Hero, who exhibits good work for the societal benefit. Entertainment to Education... every where the picture is Fit.No doubt it is a super hit. Even the forerunner would be 'Quit' if both of these were on tit's at the same time.Munna Bhai Lage Raho extoles a subject well, brings the father of the nation to the forefront again. People claimed Bapu's recall was fading though I would have supported by drawing just an iconic head of Mahatma Gandhi and all school children have shown their enthusiasm and general knowledge. but thank you Munna(Bhai Lage Raho), the beliefs are well reiterated in a simpler language. Even a 'tapori' would not mind choreographed.Munna(Bhai Lage Raho), Bapu was a force in fields unknown (by common people). Thank you, the job is well done, and the gains I hope would be higher in coming times. Long live the pardigms to competitive qualiies if Bapu,and Munna's memories mamu!"
"Circa 2003: Munnabhai (Sanjay Dutt), a gangster, could not become a certified doctor, but he finally did make his father (Sunit Dutt) proud by giving ailing patients hope and happiness through his ""magical hugs"" at the hospital. Circuit (Arshad Warsi), Munna's right hand goon ensured that whatever munna wants - is done.Circa 2006: Munnabhai (Sanjay Dutt) does it again. But this time it is our own ""Father of the Nation"" Gandhi (Dilip Prabhavalkar)who inspires the gangster to break the jinx of Hiding the Truth, which our society truly suffers with. Even as Munna-Circuit combo send the viewers into laugh riot with their pranks, Gandhi makes sure they do it per his principles. Absolutely refreshing.Charming screen presence of Munna's love interest RJ Jhanvi (Vidya Balan), party spoiling by a cunning builder Lucky Singh (Boman Irani) make viewing this movie a pleasure. Music by Shantanu Moitra (of Parineeta Fame) is good. And finally well written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani. Munna and Circuit are arguably bollywood's best screen character duo ever. No surprises, India's second hot favorite for Oscar Nomination this year after Rang De Basanti."
"UNLIKE most Hindi movies whose sequels used to flop frequently i think only this year that the sequels became hit but the sequels which where made either lacked pace or good story and screen play unlike there first parts but this movie has exceeded all expectations of mine as i thought that the movie would not be that much entertaining as the first one but i was totally proved wrong a word of appreciation should be given to the director for his work, the movie was not only a clean comedy movie but also carried message with the comedy this one entertains you from the beginning to the end the concept of MAHATMA GANDHI was great as earlier movies of him didn't make it to many hearts of the people but this movie keeping GHANDHIJI as a supporter of the lead character who is a goon by nature transfers himself to the principles followed by GHANDHIJI and tries to implement the principles of non-violence etc, which makes his life difficult for him and off-course the lead character SANJAY DUTT and his friend ARSHAD WARSI both their duo combination of comedy is just excellent all in all this movie has a very good story with equally good direction and acting."
"...is a trend setter. I wont review the storyline since many have done a better job.Making a comedy, yet a contemporary message oriented, movie has not only been a challenge to Indian movie makers but also been a disaster. Such movies were always the strongholds of trained movie makers or new art film directors from Film Institue in Pune.The movie is strictly not a sequel in the sense that the storyline is completely new. However, the Munna-Circuit duo is kept very much intact and the punchy dialogues distributed evenly among all characters. This time Munna meets Mahatma Gandhi and makes a disastrous yet a hilarious attempt to reform himself (and an others!). What starts of as an innocent visit to Gandhi library to impress his heartthrob ( a radio show host) spirals into a Gandhian struggle to reclaim the land of a small old age home. How Munna manages to come through this is the whole story.Of course, Munna is incomplete without Circuit who combines the devotion of Lakshman (to Ram) and naivet√© of Sancho Panza (of Don Quixote). Their pair is likely to be exploited commercially in the time to come. At times the movie risks the glorification of 'Goondagiri' but manages to steer clear of it with the help of Gandhigiri. The satire that drips through every line of the story nails home the point of Gandhi's relevance in modern times. However his main strength of 'Satyagraha' is never emphasized as much as the spirit of forgiveness (which is amply demonstrated).This is a MUST-WATCH movie even for the movie audiences in the United States and the Hollywood Industry. In fact the sequel is worth a remake in Hollywood than its prequel that has 'patches' of ""Patch Adams""."
"To be very honest I was not very sure if they could match the class of Munnabhai MBBS again. Even though I watched the film a good three weeks after the release, by that time the rave reviews and ripple on the box office were sign enough to make anyone believe that they have done it again. But not me. I was of the opinion that this one would have a big hangover of MBBS and people are liking what they liked in earlier version, and there would not be anything new to offer.BUT.... how wrong perceptions can be.This is a revelation of sorts. Its not even a single notch below the its predecessor. Its right up there.... on the top, among the finest films of the year...or if I may dare to say EVER. Just when we were actually forgetting Mahatma Gandhi, and he starting to become nothing more than a photo on currency notes, comes Lage Raho Munnabhai... rejuvenating Mahatma from nowhere. Franckly speaking, I was not a fan of Mahatma Gandhi, I am not very impressed with his doings... but this film surely changed the perception a lot if not completely.Revealing or commenting anything on the story or performance or any other technical aspect of the film would be stupidity, as its seen to be believed.You'll realize the beauty of the film when you won't realize when your eyes were filled with tears while laughing your hearts out.Lage Raho Munnabhai, Raju Harani (Director), VV Chopra (Producer) and the entire team.Don't MISS THIS ONE."
"I don't watch too many Indian movies these days because i am putout by the rubbish they come out with.But lage raho munnabhai was a welcome change. I had seen the first movie (munnabhai MBBS) and i had liked it. Although the first movie had borrowed its theme from patch Adams,nonetheless the director did a good job. The second movie was totally original(to my knowledge).It shows how a small time goon by chance is forced to learn about Gandhi by chance,and he starts realizing his mistakes.He tries to go out and tells the world the forgotten message of Gandhi. In short he tries to prove wrong the prophesy of Albert Einsteins ""Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood"". This movie passes along many social messages without being too corny."
