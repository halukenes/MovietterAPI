"Admittedly biased, ""Some Like It Hot"" can certainly stand on its own merit with or without my thunderous round of applause.  More than a decade ago, I had the privilege of performing both the Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon roles in ""Sugar,"" the musical adaptation of ""Some Like It Hot"" which originally starred Tony Roberts, Robert Morse and Elaine Joyce on Broadway in the 70s. Though it hardly compares to the film's original (how could it???), the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences.  I can't remember ever having a better time on stage than I did with ""Sugar,"" and it's all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated it all.In the 1959 classic, Curtis and Lemmon play two ragtag musicians scraping to make ends meet in Prohibition-era Chicago during the dead of winter who accidentally eyewitness a major gangland rubout (aka the St. Valentine's Day Massacre).  Barely escaping with their lives (their instruments aren't quite as lucky), our panicky twosome is forced to take it on the lam.  Scared out of their shoes (sorry), the boys don heels and dresses after they connect with an all-girl orchestra tour headed for sunny Florida.  Killing two birds with one stone, they figure why not go south for the winter while dodging the mob?  Once they hit the coast, they'll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits.  Enter a major detour in the form of  luscious Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane, given one of the sexiest (yet innocent) entrances ever afforded a star. Snugly fit in flashy 'Jazz Age' threads, a blast from the locomotive's engine taunts her incredible hour-glass figure as she rushes to catch her train to Florida.  The boys, stopped dead in their high-heeled tracks by this gorgeous vision, decide maybe the gig might not be so bad after all. As the totally unreliable but engagingly free-spirited vocalist/ukelele player for the band, Sugar gets instantly chummy with the ""girls"" when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze.  As things progress, complications naturally set in - playboy Curtis falls for Monroe but has his ""Josephine"" guise to contend with, while Lemmon's ""Daphne"" has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire.  What results is an uproarious Marx Brothers-like farce with mistaken identities, burlesque-styled antics, and a madcap chase finale, all under the exact supervision of director Billy Wilder, who also co-wrote the script.  Lemmon and Curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team, you almost wish THEY ended up together! Curtis does a dead-on Cary Grant imitation while posing as a Shell Oil millionaire to impress Marilyn; Lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous Joe E. Brown (who also gets to deliver the film's blue-ribbon closing line).  As for the immortal Monroe, she is at her zenith here as the bubbly, vacuous, zowie-looking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Despite her gold-digging instincts, Monroe's Sugar is cozy, vulnerable and altogether loveable, getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots, which include the kinetic ""Running Wild,"" the torchy ""I'm Through With Love,"" and her classic ""boop-boop-a-doop"" signature song, ""I Wanna Be Loved by You.""The film is dotted with fun, atmospheric characters.   Pat O'Brien and George Raft both get to spoof their Warner Bros. stereotypes as cop vs. gangster, Joan Shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the by-the-rules bandleader Sweet Sue, Mike Mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dim-bulbed henchman, and, if I'm not mistaken, I think that's young Billy Gray of ""Father Knows Best"" fame (the role is not listed in the credits) playing a snappy, pint-sized bellhop who comes on strong with the ""girls.""For those headscratchers who can't figure out why the so-called ""mild"" humor of ""Some Like It Hot"" is considered such a classic today, I can only presume that they have been brought up on, or excessively numbed by, the graphic, mindless toilet humor of present-day ""comedies.""  There was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity - it relied on wit, timing, inventiveness and suggestion - not shock or gross-out value.  It's the difference between Sid Caesar and Andrew ""Dice"" Clay; between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Chris Farley and David Spade; between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Married With Children""; between Lemmon's novel use of maracas in the hilarious ""engagement"" sequence, and Cameron Diaz's use of hair gel in a scene that ANYBODY could have made funny.  Jack Lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props.  While ""Some Like It Hot"" bristles with clever sexual innuendo, today's ""insult"" comedies are inundated with in-your-face sexual assault which, after awhile, gets quite tiresome -- lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.  I still have hope...Having ultimate faith in my fellow film devotees, THAT is why ""Some Like It Hot"" will (and should be) considered one of THE screwball classics of all time, and why most of today's attempts will (and should be) yesterday's news."
"Why a man would want to marry another man? asks Tony Curtis, Security! Jack Lemmon replays without missing a beat. Clearly he had put the question to himself before and had arrived to a perfectly sensible conclusion. Everything in this gem of a movie had been thought so cleverly and as it turned out so prophetically, that the world of our three characters, a world of prohibition and gang wars could be today and more than likely will be tomorrow. Billy Wilder analyzes human nature with an acid eye and a glorious panache for underlining our most endearing features. Our frailties. Marilyn Monroes is at her pick, the sadness in her eyes a startling metaphor in a comedy about wanting. Tony Curtis with an Eve Arden's pout is so beautiful, so charming, imitating Cary Grant and trying to be himself that, in my mind he'll be always be in a frock. And, of course, Jack Lemmon, throwing himself into the part, body and should. Only perfection can allow to end its course with a line like ""Nobody's perfect"""
"In 1929, in Chicago, the musicians and friends Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) flees from the night-club where they are playing during a police raid. Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the ""Saint Valentine's Day Massacre"" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.Yesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch ""Some Like it Hot"" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Quanto Mais Quente Melhor"" (""The Hotter, the Better"")"
"What Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis do in ""Some Like it Hot"" would be par for the course in modern movies  every other month, similar fish-out-of-water movies premiere with men posing as women (""Tootsie""), women posing as men (""The Associate""), black people posing as white people (""White Chicks""), and on and on. What makes ""Some Like it Hot"" different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.Lemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, ""Junior"", in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).Tying the pair's story into the Chicago Valentine's Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).The movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women's jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis' and Lemmon's identities. The movie's surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie's creation. The many smart double-entendres and plays on words are very well-written, and alternate between lowbrow and highbrow comedy,The films only fault might be a couple of overlong musical numbers, performed either by the whole band or soloed by Sugar Kane. Though to be expected in a Marilyn Monroe film, these musical acts are literal ""show stoppers"" that bring the comedic momentum of the film to a screeching halt. However, it is easy to over look these minor defects in the movie as a whole, because by and large it is quite funny  no wonder it s considered a classic  and after all, ""nobody's perfect""."
"Some people still say this is the greatest comedy ever made in Hollywood. Who am I to argue? Even after 45 years, it's still very funny and not the least bit dated. It is one of the true classics in the history of film.I know one thing: Marilyn Monroe never looked hotter!The film is a wonderful combination of comedy, action, suspense and romance with great old-time gangster scenes played out first in Chicago and then in Miami Beach. George Raft and Nehimiah Persoff are just great as gangsters.The stars, though, are Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis but you can also enjoy performances from famous known actors like Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown. The action scenes are in the beginning and end. In the middle, the bulk of the film, is the main story featuring comedy and romance. Lemmon has the best lines in the film and his facial expressions alone evoke lots of laughter.This film is so famous that there is no need going into detail, but for some younger person reading this, don't worry about this being an old-fashioned, boring black-and-white film your parents or grandparents liked but you would find boring. You'll have fun watching this, too, I guarantee it."
"Legendary comedy masterpiece from filmmaker Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond that Won Oscar and another 13 wins & 8 nominations . Immensely charming comedy set among Chicago and Miami , being starred by an all-star-cast . When two unemployed musicians witness a mob hit , the St Valentine massacre in Chicago carried out by mobster chief (George Raft) they flee the state in an all female band disguised as women and headed for Florida , but further complications set in. There appears a gorgeous singer , Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) , who is object of pursuit by the musicians (Jack Lemmon , Tony Curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters' retaliation . Rightly enjoyable and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun , laughters and smiles . Mordantly funny , though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however , is todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Paramount happy , the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists , including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨Running wild¨, ¨I'm through with love¨ and the immortal ¨I wanna be loved you¨. Magnificent performances from Jack Lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational Tony Curtis as a philander young , playing his Gary Gray Grant impression . Furthermore , a splendid secondary cast , a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as Pat O'Brien , George Raft , Mike Mazurski , Nehemia Persoff and , of course, smitten Joe E Brown , including his now-classic closing line . The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Some like hot¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same ."
"Any camera loved Marilyn the best In all her films, Marilyn dominated any photographer not just because of her ability with a script but ceaseless attention to the camera... More than anyone else on the set, she knew the importance of her sex appealThe 'fifties belonged to Marilyn, and in that decade it almost seemed as if the world belonged to her alsoSugar is one of Monroe's most loved and memorable character... She presents herself as a sensitive woman quick to feel compassion or affection, sensual and readily impressionable which is Sugar Kane... It was her greatest role and certainly her greatest film... The film opens in 1929 Chicago during Prohibition, where Spats Colombo (George Raft) and his gang gun down seven men in a car garage A couple of small-time Jazz musicians witness it and flee To avoid the mob, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) disguise themselves as women and attach themselves to an all-girl band Joe calls himself Josephine and Jerry calls himself Daphne The orchestra takes a train to play an engagement in Florida... On board, the two men have a hard time keeping cool with all the beautiful girls around, especially during a late-night pajama party in a Pullman sleeper Needless to say, Joe falls in love with the sensual Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a luscious ukulele player and singer with the troupe Once in Florida, Jerry meets a really wealthy bachelor Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown). Of course, Jerry is still dressed as Daphne, and the seven time divorcée proceeds to pursue Daphne Joe wants to romance Sugar but knows that he needs a wealthy front The boys think they are safe until the gangsters arrive at the same Miami hotel to attend a gangsters' convention Marilyn sang three songs in the film: ""I'm Through with Love,"" ""I Wanna Be Loved By You,"" and ""Running Wild.""The movie's closing line is one of the most celebrated in movie historyThe film won an Oscar for Best Costume Design and was nominated for six Academy Awards Irresistibly funny this black-and-white shot comedy is a definite must-see!"
"One of the all time great screen comedies, Some Like It Hot stars Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon at their best. Billy Wilder, one of the all time great directors, co-wrote and directed this fantastic movie.Set in 1929, Lemmon and Curtis are out of work musicians who witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Fleeing for their lives, they disguise themselves as female musicians in order to get to Florida and away from the mob. This is where the fun begins.Renamed ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" they try their best to keep their secret. But when ""Josephine""(Curtis) meets sexy ukulele player Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) you know he's going to blow his cover somehow. While Curtis tries to woo Monroe by pretending to be her dream man as she has told him, Lemmon is courted by Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown). Curtis adapts a Cary Grant accent and pretends to be frigid in the movie's funniest scenes. Lemmon seems to forget he's a boy and has so much fun with Fielding and adores the things he buys him. Between the cases of mistaken and pretend identities, the mobsters come to Florida for their Opera Lovers Meeting. It all winds up with a hilarious ending.This movie is a gem from start to finish. Curtis, Monroe, and Brown are great in their parts. Monroe brings a funny and sexy vulnerability to Sugar and Curtis is great with his performance as ""Josephine"" and the stuffy millionaire who talks just like Cary Grant. Lemmon really steals the movie here. He invests Daphne with such enthusiasm that we can understand why he's falling for Osgood. He's having way too much fun and it's great to watch him. This is a true classic from start to finish. It's recommended for anyone who likes to laugh.Grade:A+"
"I was never one of those kids who watched Star Wars over 100 times (actually just once or twice) and find that even the moves I rate in my top twenty can only bear watching a couple of times a year. This is the exception.Every time I watch this film, I notice something else that makes me laugh - I cannot think of a weak performance or a dodgy line.I love the fact that George Raft gives the impression that he was not told that it was a comedy and plays the chief mobster completely straight. Contrasting this with the silliness of some of his underlings is priceless stuff, though rarely slapstick (homage to Cagney aside).Ultimately it's the tight and witty script matched by an excellent cast that makes this film a pleasure for me."
"I just saw this movie for the first time and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long!! It's a rare film that makes me laugh out loud, but I definitely made some noise watching this one! Jack Lemmon gave one of the most hysterical performances I've ever seen; add Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, and one hell of a script and you have the classic comedy that all others must try to live up to. I'd give this move a 15 if they'd let me."
"""Movies should be like amusement parks"" filmmaker Billy Wilder once said ""People should go to them to have fun"". So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you'll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it's hilarious! After playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of' Josephine' and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for 'Daphne'.Some Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder's directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that's not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that's the very reason it's so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it's so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! But you can't talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full's of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. Some Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!"
"A comedy about cross-dressing is a surprising choice of subject matter for Billy Wilder, who is best known for his film noir morality tales. But his knack for multi-layered dialogue and sardonic humor work just as well here as in his more serious films. The premise of ""Some Like it Hot"" is absurd, and if there were no genuine laughs then the behavior of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's characters might easily come across as obnoxious and offensive. But there are laughs, and they come so rapidly and so often at the expense of the lead characters that these pitfalls are averted. Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe are so well cast that they are effectively playing themselves."
"Billy Wilder goes the limits in this outrageous and very funny comedy about two musicians going undercover as women to avoid the mob. It is a ridiculous premise, but Wilder and Diamond's script perfectly balances the comedy with scenes of love and romance. Curtis and Monroe have great chemistry together, and Lemmon is superb as the comedy relief in the ""serious"" scenes with George Raft. Even these are something to laugh at, but the film is not to be taken seriously; just to be laughed at. It has been almost fifty years since it was released and people still laugh at it. I have seen it three or four times and it is still as funny as seeing it for the first time. That is the true test of a comedy and Some Like It Hot passes with flying colors. A true comedy classic all the way around."
"Some Like it Hot will have a Danish re-premiere on Marilyn Monroes 75th birthday June 1st 2001, and making the text for some advertising material in that connection I saw the movie again and liked it more than ever. Most comedies about men in womens' clothings have a vulgar humour. This is, of course, not the case for films like ""Tootsie"" and ""Some Like it Hot"" in which Billy Wilder using black and white instead of colours turns down the importance of the change of sex in many ways so that you can concentrate on the comedy which is extraordinarily well timed with a spiritual dialogue. The acting of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe, not to mention Joe E Brown, Pat O'Brien and George Raft is out of this world, and of course it is possible to make a mafia war comical. Some scenes almost remind you of a Marx Brothers' movie. Like when a small berth in a train sleeping car in a few seconds is overcrowded with beautiful girls mixing Manhattan-drinks in their hot-water bottle while Jack Lemmon is desperately trying to remind himself that -- just then -- he is a girl, and Marilyn Monroe in seconds (with her back towards the camera!) produces perfect small, square ice-cubes out of a huge ice block. The music is enchanting like the Marilyn Monroe-songs which are all so well known."
"...But there's more to 'Some Like It Hot' than just it's cross-dressing element. This is a terrific comedy farce that may just well be the funniest film ever made (AFI certainly agrees with me, naming 'Some Like It Hot' as the No.1 comedy of all time in their list).So many great gags and an unbelievably witty script filled with double entendres are just some of the reasons to watch this. Lemmon gives maybe his greatest comedy performance, in the deliciously over-the-top role of Jerry/Daphne. Lemmon's completely uninhibited performance in drag works well with Tony Curtis' more self-conscious Joe/Josephine. Today the modern viewer sees this film with many homosexual overtones, but the film-makers made a point to stress the pair's heterosexuality in this film. They are given a very good reason to be in drag- they are on the run from mob bosses after witnessing the St Valentine's Day massacre. Disguised as female musicians, they join an all-girls band and meet boozy singer Sugar (Monroe).Without Monroe's performance (difficultly elicited from her), this film would not be half the classic it is today. Her presence illuminated every film she was in, and her dumb-blonde demeanor belied a great acting talent. Marilyn certainly is great here as the floozy Sugar Kane who is lonely and on the look for love.Joe E. Brown has a lot of fun with his role as a rich millionaire who falls in love Lemmon's Daphne. He also gets the best line of the film. George Raft appears to be sending himself and his suspected gangster connections up in his role as Spats Colombo, the mob boss who wants Lemmon and Curtis fixed up.Very sexy dialogue, costumes from Monroe (pretty much see-through!) and the gender-bending turns from the boys combine for great fun, but some forget how Wilder achieved the great atmosphere of this film. He made a conscious decision to shoot in black-and-white not only to lessen the impact of two males playing women, but for authenticity. This is set in 1929, and Wilder wanted the gritty feel of the Prohibition-era. One is reminded of Hawks' 'Scarface' in a number of scenes (this could also be due to the presence of Raft), and there are many gags referring to the historical period. Watch the mentions of Valentino, Pickford, Fairbanks and Wall Street and you'll see what I mean.Loads and loads of FUN! 10/10."
"Sit back and enjoy this comedy, I don't believe in greatest this and that when it comes to films, but boy, this is superb.The acting here is fantastic, all actors, even Monroe are on top form.The direction by Wilder is superb, the guy's style in this picture is perfect. He directed this film in a very clever way, by using one camera for the majority of the scenes, he could easily edit the film together without studio interference.The script is well written. The dialogue between Lemmon and Curtis is beautifully balanced.Monroe is just too hot for the screen in this picture. Although, Monroe had major off-screen problems (83 takes to get things right) she is fantastic on-screen. She may not have the best lines, but what the heck! She plays the role very well.Overall, this is awesome, it really is."
"A Comedy that has it all, and lacks absolutely nothing. ""Nobody's perfect"" may be an inherent truism, but ""Some Like it Hot"" is a definite somebody in the universe of cinema, thus it IS perfect in every sense. Swing, sex and slapstick, (three words that immediately come to mind when trying to describe it) , are a mix so delicious, so fruitful in its possibilities that one cannot imagine a film which can live up to them, and yet this one does. Marilyn, her trademark, displeasingly infantile voice aside, is a bombshell of thermonuclear dimensions, whose powers of titillation will not expire so long as there are hormones and/or Viagra. The sexual content, for socio-historical reasons cannot be as explicit as we've come to expect, but there's still plenty of it, from Monroe's see-through outfit to the double entendre worthy of the Farelli Brothers (""What do I do if it's an emergency ? - Pull the emergency break!"" ), including overtly gay themes that have a cult following of their own. The Lemmon/Curtis duo operates with gleeful, unrestrained vitality that can only be likened to Chaplin in his heyday. Though not a Musical, the combustive energy of this movie is so stimulating it almost makes you get up and dance."
"In 1929 Chicago, gangsters rule. Especially Spats Colombo (George Raft) who runs a speak-easy in the back area of a funeral home. That's where bass player, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and saxophonist Joe (Tony Curtis) have gotten their latest gigs. On payday, though, the place is raided, with many folks arrested. J and J manage to flee, however, on the fire escape. Needing a car a day later, to drive to a job in Urbana, these two musicians unhappily end up at a garage where they witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre. Spats wants to gun them down, too, but they evade bullets and make it out when sirens approach. However, since Spats knows who they are, there will be nowhere to hide. That is, unless they disguise themselves as women and join an all-girl band on the way to Florida! Ha! Yes, Josephine and Daphne, in lipstick and heels, are reborn. Almost immediately, there are problems. Daphne's bosom becomes detached while the leader of the band, Sweet Sue, senses there is something different about these gals. However, worst of all, there is a gorgeous dame, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) who sings and plays the ukelele. Daphne has to keep saying ""I'm a girl, I'm a girl whenever Sugar waltzes by while Joe is equally smitten. When they finally make it to Miami, Daphne becomes the object of affection for a rich millionaire, Osgood (Joe E. Brown). If Osgood succeeds in courting ""her"", she could become his ninth wife. Then, Joe, itching to romance Sugar, disguises himself at off hours as another rich boy, Shell Oil Junior, and uses Osgood's yacht to find some alone time with Miss Kane. What a tangle of emotions, especially when Daphne can't dampen Osgood's ardor! Also, before long, the mobsters hold a convention in, you guessed it, Miami, with Spats front and center. What are two guys, er gals, er whatever, going to do? This hotter than hot film has been ranked the best comedy of all time and with good reason. It is downright hilarious, with a clever script of great one-liners and much physical comedy. The cast is likewise topnotch, with Lemmon and Curtis, a duo of humorous hijinks, leading the way. Monroe, too, is funny, touching, and drop dead gorgeous. Brown turns in one the most memorable character turns ever while the Raft and the rest have the audience rolling, too. Sets, costumes, and the fresh direction complete a masterpiece of mirth. Hot, cold, or lukewarm, whatever the day turns out to be, if you need the lift of laughter, this is choice number one."
"There is always a thing about Classics, even before you absorb the first frame; you are burdened with huge expectations. But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.I feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.I am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.The manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.Some Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back."
"With Billy Wilder's steady direction, the great casting, and Wilder/Diamond's sparkling script Some Like It Hot has become one of the most enjoyed comedies of cinema history. The story itself is pure comedy gold; the unhappy jazz-musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are witness to the St. Valentine massacre in 1929 and flees from Chicago with an all-girl-band who's headed for Miami, dressed up as ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"". Soon both are hooked on Sugar Kane (Marylin Monroe), the band's lead singer - but things gets more complicated when arrived in Miami, Daphne attracts a elderly playboy and the gangster of Chicago arrives at the Floria-hotel to have a mafia-meeting.The work of the three participants in center is truly great; Marylin Monroe is at her most sexy and charming, Tony Curtis' brilliant control and Jack Lemmon is truly priceless at his peak. The movie paces fantastically throughout opening scenes of Chicago, onto the train-ride (features fantastically funny moments of brilliant comedy timing) and arriving at the hotel in Florida, and the situations that occurs with the band, with playboy Osgood Fielding III, Marylin Monroe and the mafia. And Billy Wilder shows his talent with keeping such a sparkling screenplay brilliantly paced and edited, never rushing itself - and Wilder sneaks in some fine moments of noir with the Chicago-gangsters brutality and cruelness. And the movie is a altogether different experience as a comedy than anything before it, the absurdity and quirkiness of Curtis and Lemmon in a transvestite-comedy is fantastically funny, and the final dialog between Osgood Fielding and Daphne/Jerry seemingly came out of the blue, and surprised me just as much today as it did back in 1959. Some Like It Hot is nothing less than a must-see in comedy, and cinema history."
"What can you say about this movie that has not been said before?
A genuine classic, the basics run as follows... Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and the ever-fabulous Jack Lemmon...... the boys do drag, Marilyn sings occaisionally, looks edible in practically see-through dresses AND acts well to boot...
Lemmon and Curtis play musicians accidentally caught up in the St Valentine's Day Massacre... they go on the run in the only band which will hire them - an all female band which means their only option is to drag up and bluff their way along - and meet up with marginally alcoholic and slightly unhinged Marilyn.. some chaos ensues as Curtis tries to woo her and Lemmon unwillingly finds a suitor for himself... The film is surprisingly touching in places but is basically a lovely silly comedy. It regularly appears in lists proclaiming it to be one of the 100 best movies of all time and quite rightly so. Marilyn - despite suffereing a miscarriage during filming - is on superb form, Jack Lemmon looks almost attractive in drag and Tony Curtis actually avoids being too slimy and annoying. The drag scenes are wonderfully underplayed and the classy use of black and white photography throughout helps make both the drag and the period setting look plausible.
Highlights include Tony Curtis's Cary Grant impression (for those of you uneducated in the fabulousness of Cary Grant check out Bringing Up Baby, also on this term), Jack Lemmon being romanced in great style - which leads to just about the best last line of a movie of all time - and Marilyn looking glorious of course.If you've never seen this movie you really really should; if you already have then I am sure you need no persuasion to see it again!"
"The Great Famous as well as the Great Infamous occurrences in a nation's history are and always will be looked upon as subjects worthy of a film treatment. Whether an incident were to be filmed from a story and its screenplay form written directly for the screen or an adaptation of a Novel, a Short Story or a Stage Play, they are an important element of formulating our image of our World. Right or wrong, it is a fact of life and one that we must learn to live with.A good example of just what we are driving at is the occurrences of October 26, 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona. Known as ""The Gunfight at O.K. Corral"", the incident is probably the best known single shoot-em-up incident in the History of the Old West. Countless references are made to it in our Western Movies, be they Major Motion Pictures or the ""B"" Picture Series of the Matinée & Bubble Gum Set.Equally as familiar to the movie going public and probably the best known example of Urban Gangster violence of the 'Lawless Prohibition/Gangster Era, ""The St.Valentine's Day Massacre"" has been given Film treatment many times. It is featured in the Rod Steiger's Starring Title Role as AL CAPONE (Allied Artists, 1959).Director Roger Corman gave us THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE (Los Altos Productions / 20th Century-Fox, 1967); devoting the entire 100 minutes of screen time to the behind the scenes incidents leading up to it and to the Great Mass Murder.With Ben Gazzara in the title role, we had CAPONE (Santa Fe Productions/ 20th Century-Fox, 1975), also which had the Massacre and its preparation and aftermath as central events in the story.With the dramatic come the comedies, spoofs, comedians, the social commentators and the satirists. There surely would be a comedy that would at least make mention of the Massacre in passing.And it happened. Producer/co-Writer/Director Billy Wilder gave us SOME LIKE IT HOT (Ashton Prod./Mirisch Corp.-United Artists, 1959). To a hilariously great script, Directot Wilder added plenty of Hollywood Star Power in Miss Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Tony Curtis and Mr. Jack Lemmon. In supporting position, we saw the likes of veteran, old pros like Joe E. Brown (as Millionaire Osgood Fielding III), George Raft (as 'Spats' Colombo), Pat O'Brien (as Detective Mulligan), Nehimiah Persoff (as Little Boneparte), Joan Shawlee (Sweet Sue), Billy Gray (Sig Pokikoff), George E. Stone (Toothpick Charley), Mike Mazurki (Spats' Henchman), Dave Barry (Beinstock), Harry Wilson (Spats Henchman), Beverly Wills (Delores), Barbara Drew (Nellie), Edward G. Robinson, Jr. (Johnny Paradise), Al Brenamen (Bell Hop), Pat Comiskey (Spats' Henchman), Tom Kennedy (Bouncer), Paul Frees (Funeral Director Mozerella & ""Josephine""-Voices), Joe Gray (Mobster at Banquet), Harold 'Tommy' Hart (Official #2), Ted Hook (Official #1), John Indisano (Waiter), Jack McClure (Spats Henchman), Helen Perry (Rosella) and Marian Collier (Clarinet Player, Olga) and Joan Fields, Mary Foley, Penny McGuiggin, Laura Mitchell, Colleen O'Sullivan (Band Members All).OUR STORYIn a nutshell, its 1929, Prohibition is in full swing in a defiant Chicago. Two struggling and apparently over-sexed Musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) narrowly missed being arrested in a Police Raid on a Speak Easy run by big time Hoodlum, 'Spats' Columbo (George Raft). Obtaining a 'Gig' to play t the University of Illinois Dance in Champaign-Urbana, over 100 miles to the South of Chicago. Borrowing a Car from a Girlfriend of Joe's, they have the Bad Luck of being present at the Clark Street Garage when the mass killings take place.In order to escape being snuffed-out for witnessing the deed, the two masquerade as Women and join up with A Band made up of all Lady Musicians and (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). The Band is heading out of the snowy, Chicago Winter for the ""safety"" of Sunny, Florida. That is ""safety"", until 'Spats' and his Boys, show up in the Sunshine State for the Convention of ""Friends of Italian Opera"", which is code for the Crime Syndicate! The fun continues.The film is wild, fast paced and cleverly written. It has guaranteed laughs through-out. Mr. Wilder and Company, have constructed a sort of cross between the old James Cagney/Humphrey Bogart feature, THE ROARING TWENTIES (Warner Brothers, 1939) and a Mack Sennett Silent Keystone Comedy. They get us Laughing and keep it that way.The filming used the City of Coronado in Suburban San Diego, as the location doubling for an unavailable State of Florida. Both the beautiful Coronado Beach and the 1920's styled Coronado Hotel were put to use to great effect.And just one more thing before we signoff for now. Of all the veteran players appearing in the movie, it is the fine performance of Mr. Joe E. Brown which steals more than his share of the film. Joe E. Brown had his hey day in a series of comedies done I the 1930's and had been relegated to supporting riles since then. The role of eccentric Millionaire Osgood Fielding III, who finds himself attracted to 'Daphne', the Bull Fiddle Player (Jack Lemmon).And it is Joe E. Brown who speaks the memorable last line of dialogue, which is, no, no! I won't tell! If you don't know, buy it or rent it; but see it! Don't wait another Day!"
"SPOILERS Each year a television executive ponders how to fill an evening's television. Rather than putting original thought into the process, one idea that he constantly comes back to is the ""Top 10"" list. Spending hours upon hours discussing the best horrors, the best musicals, the best number ones of the 1980s, these lists vary amongst a million different ideas. One of the most popular though is the Top 100 Films of All Time. This list tends to contain some of the all time greats and all too often it sadly has ""Star Wars"" at number one. One film which always features though, and remains perhaps the funniest comedy of all time is Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"". With magical performances and some of the greatest comedy moments of all time, it remains as fresh today as it did upon it's release.Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) are down and broke musicians in alcohol free Chicago. As the Mafia continue to fight between themselves, life goes on for our two heroes. That is until they witness a Gangland killing. Now on the run, they disguise themselves as women and hide in a female band troop. Relocated to Florida, the two spend their time keeping themselves hidden and talking to the beautiful, yet ""not too smart"" Sugar Cane (Marilyn Monroe).Unlucky to have been released at the same time as the Epic ""Ben Hur"", it might be one of the biggest travesties in Oscar history that ""Some Like It Hot"" never received a Best Picture nomination. It did however receives nods for Wilder's direction and Lemmon's acting. Lemmon in particular is superb as Jerry/Daphne, the more emotional of the two men, who finds himself being chased by the dozy Osgood Fielding III (Joe E Brown). With some of the best lines in the film, Lemmon thrives, and on a personal note, he's only outperformed this performance with ""Avanti"" and ""The Odd Couple"", the first of which being another Wilder creation.This film also has another treasure about it. In a time where Hollywood starlets are making a bit of a reappearance, it's amusing that one or two of them (most notably Scarlett Johansson) model their appearance on the biggest starlet of them all. Whilst noticeably more built up during this film (being pregnant at the time), Marilyn Monroe is beautiful from the first scene on the train station through to the end. Monroe simply oozes beauty and thrives in a role which she wasn't originally the choice for.Perhaps the crucial thing about ""Some Like It Hot"" is just how good the script is. With lines which just smack of sexual referencing, it causes belly laughs throughout. It never resorts to the sort of lowbrow humour of most of our modern comedy, and it demonstrates how light hearted comedy should be done. It's perhaps the finest comedy film of all time, and it should be mandatory viewing for any film fan."
"Back in the days when certain things were taboo in movies, there were always directors who were looking for ways to push the limits. Billy Wilder did this in ""Some Like It Hot"", the movie that may very well have been the best movie that he, Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon ever did.Curtis and Lemmon play Joe and Jerry, two musicians in 1929 Chicago who have to flee a speakeasy before a police raid. Now unemployed, they get a job to play at an out of town joint. While they are getting the car, they witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, when one group of mobsters murdered another group. Desperate to hide, they dress up as women and get jobs in an all-female band, using the pseudonyms Josephine and Daphne. In this band, they meet Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe), the sexiest singer imaginable. When the band arrives in Florida is when the real nuttiness begins. ""Daphne"" gets seduced by millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), while ""Josephine"" pretends to be a millionaire named Junior, who seduces Sugar Kane. But then, the mobsters who were behind the massacre arrive.What is so great about this movie is how they push the limits. Before calling the all-female band, Joe tells Jerry that they're going to shave their legs. You must realize that back then, talking about legs was like talking about genitals. And just the idea of men dressing as women might be interpreted as saying that they're gay (Joe and Jerry are not gay). Finally, the last line in the movie is all about acceptance, no matter who someone is. But all in all, ""Some Like It Hot"" gets eleven out of ten stars in my book, as it is so damn hilarious and has some really good values. Splendid."
"What a great cinematic experience it is to view Some Like It Hot. The movie provides you with a bit of everything from madcap action, screwball comedy, mob drama, and campy romance, along with a little sugar on top in sweet sensation, Marilyn Monroe. Despite the apparent weight-gain she looks visually stunning, and her close-to-home performance is worth noting as well. There are many subtexts that lie in Billy Wilder's masterpiece, including one that could very well do with Marilyn's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk. Much like Marilyn, the lounge singing Sugar is searching for love with a decent somebody other than the player-type she often frequents (in the film's case, saxophonists). Perhaps men found this sultry misses too intimidating, making Marilyn's love-life in the real world just the same.
	Another suggestive undertone could do with the abundant `crisis of masculinity' shot off in the late 1950's. Two middling male musicians (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), all dragged out, seem to be granted opportunities they would never have had if remained as `men' (i.e. marrying a millionaire, accepting free trips and consolations, etc.). Is it femininity that gains all? Like Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie, it is apparent these `beauties' really weren't beauties at all; bosses-the mob and Sugar's-pick it up right away. Why the feminine gain? Do men make wiser women than younger girls?  	All rhetoric aside, Some Like It Hot's concept is a lot simpler: the men join an all girls band heading to Florida, evading the possibilities of being found as the witnesses to a gangland rubout (a.k.a. the St. Valentine's Day Massacre). Of course there are many complications for these `women' along the way, including their intense magnetism towards Sugar. Never is there a dull moment in Some Like It Hot, with quickly paced classical cutting, a wholesome variety of locations, and a brilliant screenplay much to the allure of Wilder's other treasure Sunset Boulevard. Not many movies over 40 years can hold up the laughter presented in Hot. In one of the funnier scenes, a relentless drunkard in the midst of a `funeral parlor' seize-up demands more scotch-filled decaf: `How bout another cup of coffee!' Classic, indeed.
5/5 stars"
"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠This is essential viewing! Classic screwball comedy with all the right ingredients to make you laugh, its just irresistibly funny.
A very witty script matched by an excellent cast that makes this film a pleasure for me.
Sit back and enjoy, this is awesome, it really is."
"Billy Wilder was a masterful director. The American Film Institute names this movie the greatest comedy of all time. It's not hard to see why. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are excellent. Monroe, I never saw her as an amazing actress, but she did pretty good in this film all the same.
The humor is top notch and very smart. The funniest parts are when Curtis and Lemmon are bickering with each other. Apparently the black and white look was done because both of their makeup made them look so ugly that Wilder thought black and white cinematography would conceal their ugly makeup. Nothing wrong with that though, black and white movies rock! 
It's a great comedy. One for the ages! Is it the best comedy ever? No. Not in my mind. But is it too 5? Absolutely!"
"Some Like It Hot (1959): Dir: Billy Wilder / Cast: Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Marilyn Monroe, Joe E. Brown, George Raft: Delightfully funny comedy referring to the expression and appreciation of jazz music as well as the dilemma at hand. The title may also refer too a man who isn't what he claims and a woman who isn't intelligent enough to know the difference. It is a laugh loaded joy starring Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as two musicians who witness a murder and flee for their lives. They disguise themselves as women and blend in with an all girl band and board a train. Curtis falls for Marilyn Monroe while Lemmon becomes the centre of affection of an old lout who is at the resort that the band marks as their next stop. Clever and surprising with fantastic witty dialogue that ranks among Billy Wilder's greatest work, which includes Sunset Boulevard, Sabrina and Double Indemnity all of which arrive within different genres. Curtis and Lemmon provide hilarious chemistry with Monroe absolutely ravishing as the dumb blonde bit. George Raft plays the mob boss like a pro as he and his posse seek out the leads unknowing what awaits in an ominous birthday cake. Joe E. Brown plays a rich playboy whom immediately takes to Lemmon and delivers one of the funniest closing lines in film history. Observant view of hardship of women that heats as one of the funniest comedies ever made. Score: 10 / 10"
"This is the first Marilyn Monroe movie that I have seen and I must say that I thought it was quite funny. Monroe, though, doesn't have the screen presence that most people seem to claim that she has. In fact, I wasn't really sure if it was her when she first appeared. Okay, this movie is more focused on Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, and they actually have more presence than she does, but she does stand out.Lemmon and Curtis play a couple of musicians, Joe and Jerry, who watch a gangland killing, and after escaping with their lives, they dress up as women, becoming Josephine and Daphne, and join a band going to Miami. On the way Joe falls in love with the singer, Sugar Kane, (Monroe) and Daphne ends up gaining the unwanted attention of a dizzy millionaire.The comedy in this movie actually has a lot of sexual innuendos, and in my opinion, is far superior to that of Tootsie. In a way the plot is similar, and the problems that the characters in both movies encounter are also the same, but the difference is that I feel that the comedy in Some Like it Hot is executed much better than it was in Tootsie. In a way, Tootsie seemed to be a comedy with a message that became far too preachy, while Some Like it Hot is a farcical romp in which two men try to hide the fact that they are not women from a lot of other people."
"Some Like It HotSome Like It Hot is an excellent movie, which was made in 1959, and still today is one of the best comedies created. It is so good that the fact that it is made in black and white is completely forgotten. Billy Wilder directed the movie, and the cast included such stars as Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Also this movie won an Academy Award for the Best Costume Design, Black and White, the reason why it says black and white is because at the time movies could already be made with color, so the award were divided between color, and black and white.The movie is set in 1927, and it is about two musicians who find themselves unemployed, and go searching for a job. Both found a job on girls band and this made it impossible for them to take it, so they got another job, and while getting into the car both men Joe (Tony Curtis), and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) were witnesses of a murder committed by the Chicago mafia. Being witness of this incident both Joe, and Jerry must leave and hide from the mafia, which is looking for them because of what they had witnessed before. Joe and Jerry decide to take the job of the girl's band and disguise themselves as girls, so that they could enter the band without any problems. From the point where both men enter the train with the rest of the girls the rest of the movie is an extremely comic journey.The movie's main Characters were Joe, or Josephine, Jerry, or Daphne, and Sugar Kane. Joe and Josephine were both made by Tony Curtis and he fitted perfectly for both characters due to his personality, he was a very comic part of the movie and made an exceptional job. Jerry and Daphne were both acted by Jack Lemmon and he was also brilliant in the movie and fitted his role perfectly and in my opinion was more comic than Tony Curtis in the movie. Both Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were vital in the creation of this movie; definitely the movie wouldn't have been the same without these two magnificent actors. Then, there was Sugar Kane which was interpreted by Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, she was the perfect women for the role due to the fact that Sugar Kane was a very beautiful woman, the character of Sugar Kane represented in a way a very materialist and woman and with alcoholic problems.In my opinion on of the best scenes of the movie is when Joe is dressed as a wealthy man and is with Sugar Kane at the yacht while Daphne is dancing with a rich man names Osgood who is in love with ""her"", and doesn't really know she is really a he. A scene, which I didn't like, was at the beginning when Joe and Jerry are looking for jobs, I found that part of the movie kind of slow and bored me for a little moment.Some Like It Hot was a risky movie due to the fact that men were transforming themselves into women, and at the time to watch this was not very common. Curtis Hanson, a director, said: ""It's a film about sex from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual roles, and of course sexual identity."" The fact that both men dressed as women and all those problems came in was pretty funny and this movie was not only a romantic comedy because of the love between Joe and Sugar Kane, but it is also a screwball, and gangster movie. Screwball because of everything that happens throughout the movie, and gangster because of all the mafia issued shown in the film.I believe that this movie would be good for any kind of audience because it is a great comedy and it will make anyone laugh and have a great time. I really enjoyed this movie and wouldn't doubt of watching it once more. I would give this movie a 4.7/5This review was written by a sophomore who enjoys watching movies and loves anything related to comedy. This move review was written for an film appreciation class."
"The great Billy Wilder directs, writes, and has a say in the screenplay of one of the really great comedies. Some Like It Hot is up there in the best five comedies...ever made. Marilyn Munroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are superb as the three leads in this risqué 1959 steam-roller. Wilder did everything to get up the noses of the censors, and was clever enough to get away with all of it. In 1959 men dressing and behaving like ladies...wearing ladies clothes...was dangerous ground to tread on. And the many sub-plots that this brought about were also ""no go"" areas. He succeeded just like the T.V. Classic Seinfeld...when they declared ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" when they did there great ""sexual preference"" episode. In the case of Some Like It Hot...we need to remember...this was 1959. Munroe was always difficult to work with...continually turning up late, and being obviously neurotic. In a famous B.B.C. talk show in the 1970s Curtis described Munroe as a ""fruit cake"". I am sure that was true, but she was wonderful in Some Like It Hot. The movie is a classic."
"Some Like it Hot is a screwball comedy about two musicians somehow getting mixed up with a Chicago crime syndicate and their attempt to run away from them. They end up disguising themselves as girls in order to land a gig with an all girl band in Florida. Along the way, they meet an attractive, innocent girl, who has a tendency to fall for sax players, and attempt to charm her. Things get when complicated when the syndicate arrives in Florida for some other event and paths of the musicians and the gang cross again.Tony Curtis as the ever-optimistic Joe and Jack Lemmon as the frank and jocular Jerry were both delightful in their portrayals. Their on-screen chemistry constitutes the heart of the movie as they land themselves in awkward situations and wriggle their way out with the help of some cunning and fortune. Marilyn Monroe as the dim and naive Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, is the central character around which the plot rotates. It is almost impossible not to fall for her as she is ever so attractive and yet so innocent in character. There are times when one forgets about the movie and is enchanted by her presence on screen, her singing at the band's performance and the scene on the yacht being two of them. Joe E Brown as Osgood, puts in a hearty performance as the love seeking rich oldie who would go to any lengths to win Daphne's heart. He provides the fitting end to the movie with the iconic ""Nobody's Perfect"". The on screen camaraderie between Joe and Jerry, as they bicker along the way and yet never leave each other in times of trouble, is what makes this movie special. Joe as an esoteric millionaire who has a 'problem', Osgood has the doting lover infatuated with Daphne, and Daphne as the light hearted and carefree maiden who finds herself in perplexing situations , are three characters that give life to this brisk paced comedy. The most hilarious scene though has to be the post dates scene where Jerry's incredible contemplation of a love affair and future life with Osgood is discussed, leaving the audience in fits of laughter.Overall, Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is a wonderful comedy that has all the ingredients for an all time classic."
"Some Like It Hot is a retelling of a West German tale titled Fanfaren der Liebe (1951) (Fanfares of Love) beautifully directed by Billy Wilder with an all-star cast including the eternal beauty of Marilyn Monroe, and comedy styling's of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. With a central prolific theme that has been told more than once and yet is just as prevalent today as it ever was or will be: What we want and what we need are often two separate things. However, under the expertise of Wilder, the pure star quality of cast and crew shine out all the more. The gags come thick and fast with almost every sequence either a set up for the next gag or a gag in the making. Some Like It Hot is a tale that begins with a bitterly cold February in Chicago 1929, which two musicians find themselves on the run from the mob, after witnessing the Saint Valentines Massacre. Our intrepid hero's Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) disguise themselves as female musicians Josephine (Curtis) and Daphne (Lemmon), and join an all-girl orchestra bound for Miami.Leaving behind a bitter Chicago winter, they meet the intoxicating Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe), which Jerry remarks ""Look how she moves. Like Jell-O on springs. She must have some sort of built-in motor. I tell you, it's a whole different sex.""(Jack Lemmon Some Like It Hot 1959) Henceforth comedy ensues with the gags coming thick and fast, lightening reflexes with the dialogue between Joe, Jack and Sugar and perfect comedic timing between them. A testament to all that is womanhood, has yet to be a finer than Marilyn Monroe, seemingly poured into the gowns lovingly crafted by Australian costume designer Orry-Kelly, with neck lines and translucent qualities that would even have the censors of today raising eyebrows. With her classic solo of ""I Wanna Be Loved by You."" Albeit Marilyn does not have the best singing voice, which is superfluous when one considers the situation, a pretty girl standing in front of an orchestra and singing a song. Monroe and Wilder turn it into one of the most blatantly sexual scenes in the movies. Monroe wears a clinging, see-through dress, gauze covering the upper slopes of her breasts, the neckline scooping to a censor's eyebrow north of trouble. Wilder places her in the centre of a round spotlight that does not simply illuminate her from the waist up, but toys with her like a secondary neckline, dipping and clinging as Monroe moves her body higher and lower in the light with teasing precision.All the time Monroe seems oblivious to the effect of singing this song so innocently. To experience that scene is to affirm as to why no other actor since, male or female has more sexual chemistry with the camera.Underneath all the frills, bold sexual symbolism, and gender bending, the movie is ultimately about Joe and Jerry (Curtis and Lemmon) with truly outstanding supporting characters like Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) and Spats Colombo (George Raft). While Joe (Curtis) when not in drag introduces himself as the Shell Oil heir and wickedly parodies Cary Grant's unmistakable accent in brilliant fashion, so much so that when Daphne/Jerry (Lemmon) says accusingly ""And where did you get that phoney accent? Nobody talks like that!"" Jerry (Lemmon) gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop taking the selfless route and entertains a real millionaire whose yacht is being used by Joe (Curtis) in an attempt to seduce Sugar (Monroe). Daphne (Lemmon) is so unlike a real woman in mannerism as much as appearance that when real millionaire Osgood (Joe E. Brown) attempts to wine and dine him, it is hilarious that he cannot see behind Jerry's (Lemmon) disguise. With Osgood seducing Jerry (Lemmon) on the dance floor and Joe (Curtis) seducing Sugar (Monroe) on the yacht is both romantic and wickedly funny at the same time. The payoff happens during the following morning, when Joe returns to their room to find Jerry now engaged to Osgood. Keep an eye Jack Lemmon (Jerry/Daphne) during this scene; he is so energetic, so full of life, almost to the point of hamming it up with his castanets. Jerry/Daphne (Lemmon) is exquisite in this sequence. He is deliriously happy at finding his soul mate. He is so hilariously convincing that even when asked by Joe (Curtis), ""Why would a guy want to marry a guy?"" that we completely buy it when he answers, ""Security!"" Even though the violence in this gem of the silver screen is neither satire nor comedy but visceral and grim, which adds to the overall feel that the Hero's (Joe and Jerry) very lives are in peril and we joyously buy every gag and punch line that Billy Wilder expertly delivers to us. I do not believe I am alone in the opinion that Wilder was one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. Escaping Europe before World War II, Wilder set about commenting on the world around him with a sensibility and awareness seldom seen in cinema today. Yet he could create a film that, yes has a darker undertone of the mob's ruthlessness, but oh so wonderfully light hearted and romantic characters that once they realized what they wanted wasn't what they needed, and that they needed no pretence to attain what they desired. Simply put Some Like It Hot is one of those timeless classics that are just as relevant and amusing today as it was when it was released. It captured one of those great moments in movie-making, where a film no longer is a simple representative of its period, but has transcended itself to become something that is truly timeless. Osgood (Brown) delivers the best curtain line in the movies. If you have seen the movie, you know what it is, and if you have not, you deserve to hear it for the first time from him."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Billy Wilder's classic was the latest in the comedy series sponsored by Dallas Film Society and Dallas Morning News. It is almost always ranked as one of the top comedy films of all-time, and often the best ever. While that's a bit higher than I would rank it, there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place in cinematic history. To fully understand the impact of the film, it helps to remind yourself of the times ... it was filmed more than 50 years ago. What we might call tame today, was incredibly risqué and daring for the times.What really stands out while watching the film is just what an incredible screen presence Marilyn Monroe possessed. It is quite challenging to take your eyes off her during any of her scenes. I am at a loss to come up with any other actor or actress who even comes close to this level of camera-cornering. Greta Garbo and Marlon Brando were great, but Marilyn is transcendent while on screen. Of course, the reports of her personal issues are legendary. Supposedly on this film, she was constantly 2-3 hours late, couldn't remember her lines and had to be coddled by all involved. Still, the final product is stunning and director Billy Wilder understood that no other actress could be substituted. Sadly, Marilyn only made two more films and was dead 3 years after this film was released.As wonderful as Marilyn is, this is really the story of Joe and Jerry, or Josephine and Daphne, or even Junior. Those five characters are all played with crackling comedy timing by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. Lemmon, as Daphne, is especially terrific as he tango's the night away with Osgood Fielding III (played by Joe E Brown). Curtis is at his best when courting Marilyn's Sugar Kane while sporting his Cary Grant impersonation and driving the boat backwards.There are so many classic comedy moments in this film, and though it is based on a 1935 French farce titled Fanfare d'Amour, Wilder and his co-writer and frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond made it their own by adding the gangster story line. Seeing notorious movie bad guy George Raft tied to the 1929 Chicago St Valentine's Day Massacre adds a dimension that many writers/directors would be unable to handle. Instead, Wilder adds his frenetic dialogue and mixes in some wild double-entendre's, a touch of Marx Brothers, and the sensuous singing of Marilyn to deliver a world class comedy.The Florida scenes were filmed at the historical Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, which remains a very popular resort location even today. Marilyn sings ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" and ""I'm Through With Love"" in such a way that her character's naivety adds a dimension that breaks the heart of Joe (Curtis) and mesmerizes the viewer. Billy Wilder is certainly one of the Hollywood giants and delivered such classics as Sunset Blvd, The Apartment, Irma laDouce, and Witness for the Prosecution. His excellence spans numerous film genres, and we admire his patience and proficiency in juggling the issues required to pull off Some Like it Hot ... and avoid the fuzzy end of the lollipop."
"I went to see this because of Marilyn Monroe. Of course I was not disappointed. She is not as dumb as she describes herself is. And she sings well too. But it was Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis who make this comedy alive. You can sense the sparkles between them even when they first appear in the show in Chicago. Then, when they pose as women it was so amusing and pleasant! Yet their performance would not have been so engaging if not for the witty lines and intriguing plot. There is literally not a dull moment throughout the whole movie. The plot develops very well and the pacing was just right. Although the Osgood Fielding III character (Joe Brown) seems to be annoying in the beginning, he turns out to be instrumental in later part of the story and the heartily conversation in perfect tempo between him and Lemmon on the speed boat is so memorable.Some Like it Hot is perfect in all sense: acting, script, direction, costume (Oh how Monroe's dresses keep me gazing), music. It is such a classic that we will probably never have anything like this for a long, long time."
"What a fun movie, I can't believe I never saw it before tonight. Somehow, I have seen ""Seven Year Itch"" more times than I need to, but this one seldom comes on, caught it in full on youtube, thank goodness.The acting is wonderful; was especially impressed by Tony Curtis, as I never thought he had such range. Jack Lemmon and Marilyn were at their best in this film. It moves very quickly, even though there are a few spots that go on a bit too long, i.e chase scenes toward the end. Marilyn's outfits were pretty eye-popping for 1959. I felt like I was watching a film actually made in 1929, as it was set, at times.All in all, very funny, the men as women were as funny and perfect as could be. Everything since, including ""Tootsie"" was playing catch-up to Jack and Tony in their roles, especially Jack as Daphne. I can see why he was nominated for an Oscar."
"Strange in my 70 plus years I had no seen this delightful movie until yesterday. It entails two goofy characters in drag taking the old steamy night train from Chicago to Miami Beach California (cannot be Florida as mountains appear on the horizon).They are heading to the ocean for a variety of reasons, basically for survival. Plenty of laughs involved. MM was a really good comedienne but most just remember her full figure (not quite the ideal by early C21st standards but terrific for the 1950s though surpassed by France's less voluptuous but more sexy BeBe and Grace Kelly's superb cool beauty). Like Casablanca the best part of the film is the last sentence in the script ""Well, no one is perfect""."
"Brazen, rambunctious, lascivious comedy, expertly written by Billy Wilder (who also directed) and I.A.L. Diamond from a story by R. Thoeren and Michael Logan. High-spirited slapstick, with both sharp and soft edges, involves two luckless Prohibition-era musicians in Chicago who inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre; they take it on the lam after disguising themselves as women, becoming part of an all-female jazz combo! Hilarious film still delivers the goods, from Tony Curtis' Cary Grant impression (to win over chanteuse Marilyn Monroe) to Jack Lemmon inexplicably falling for a wacky elderly millionaire (the priceless Joe E. Brown). Only in the more subdued seduction scenes between Curtis and Monroe does the film's pacing flag; otherwise, boffo entertainment. ***1/2 from ****"
"Well, dear fellow film lovers: If you ain't seen this one you ain't seen nuttin'! A few years ago, ""Some like it hot"" was rated the greatest comedy ever made and though I do not much care for -- or believe in -- such ratings the fact is that I was readily in agreement with this one and I continue to think so.It is a film full of verve, sharp dialog, stinging one-liners, quick pace, imaginative chase sequences, and possibly the quickest-witted ending answer in the history of the cinema: Nobody's perfect! Yep, too true, nobody is perfect - but in this movie director Billy Wilder came as close to the Holy Grail of a perfectly directed movie as I can remember: Marilyn was at her most sensual and in the best acting form I ever saw from her; Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Joe E. Brown and George Raft peerless; and the supporting cast of Nehemiah Persoff, George E. Stone, and many others was marvellous. Absolutely no weaknesses in the acting that I could detect.Finally, a word about the outstanding photography in the ""film noir"" tradition yet never interferes with the smooth narrative.What a movie! What a world that was without computers, cellphones, and all the other global technological and economic dictatorship gadgets that control our lives."
"This has to be the funniest movie ever made.  Marilyn Monroe was never better, and Joe E. Brown the greatest sex-starved geezer to ever hit the silver screen in this film.  I recommend this film to all ages."
"Not all of Wilder's projects are as well designed as this. But among the best designed of films before 1960 are his.This is classic because its about sex as so, so many movies are. But it uses Monroe in ways that greatly exceed her ability to use herself. I believe that the Monroe legend is because of Wilder's placing of her in a context that amplified her appeal. Wilder had worked with her before. He selected and co-wrote the screenplay around her, adapting as he went.The situation is set up to provide a context of shifting sexual identity so that she can anchor the thing with us concluding that yes, this is sex. This is what it means to be a desirable woman.And its not just the obvious things, the drag identities. Its in the girl jazz band. The machine gunner jumping out of a cake instead of a stripper, the business of a funeral really being a party, the henpecked manager: pronounced ""beanstalk."" Even in boozing out of a hot water bottle.Its so deft in structure, so accommodating to her strengths and weaknesses, that it makes me cry, knowing that Wilder only was tuned properly for two films. And this one was essentially a waste, except for getting her past the tipping point of being a legend, a presidential plaything and Warhol icon.The problem of this movie is that after its all engineered and polished, after all the targeting and focus, it just isn't that funny. What was funny sixty years ago  men in drag is screwball situations  just doesn't catch today. You have to do a context reset and you might like who you pretend to be.Its a great structure, a masterpiece of understanding and designing cinema for a specific purpose. And a sad waste.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"great laughs, great music, great acting I wont spoil it. its by far my favorite Marilyn movies other than Niagara, misfits, don't bother to knock, river of no return, gentlemen prefer blonde's, how to marry a millionaire, and that's it. if you want a great laughs and music and acting this is a movie for you. I love this film believe it or not it was my first Marilyn movie to watch in my life. jack Lemmon, and tony Curtis is fantastic make me laugh a lot you might think its dumb but no its not its classic just give a watch I tell you I laughed a lot and loved it. no doubt one of the best Marilyn movies, classics, and comedy by far watch it when you get the chance don't miss this"
"A movie that is synonymous to the Internet jargon LOL(Laugh out loud) and ROFL(Rolling over the floor laughing). I must first shower encomiums on the out-of-the-world script. And what an actor Jack Lemmon is. This movie also established the long-term association between Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder in making movies together.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis gave one of the greatest performance by transvestites. While a luscious Marilyn Mornoe is there to seduce you, sing and shake and make you swoon, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis provide unlimited rib-tickling humor.Oh, i just forgot to mention what a brilliant, funny writing it was. There are umpteen phrases that make you reiterate.AFI rightly placed it at the helm of '100 greatest laughs'."
"Comedy set in the late 20s/early 30s features stereotypes of the era -- bombshell torch singer (Monroe, of course), hard-as-nails gangster boss (Raft, of course), and go-getter protagonists (Lemmon and Curtis, of course).  Everything is spoofed in a light way.  Very nice photography. Some of the jokes are flat, but the visual humor can't fail -- especially Lemmon in his crossdressing disguise, which he seems to grow more and more into until his final scene where he and Joe E. Brown seem to be ""sailing into the sunset"" together.  As Joe says ""nobody's perfect.""  But this movie's close."
"A delightful cross-dressing comedy, this was one of the first of its type and it still is one of the funniest. It is very cleverly written, impeccably acted, particularly by Joe E. Brown, and features excellent chemistry between the two leads. There are parallels in the film to actual events and attitudes that existed in the 1920s, giving the film a historical insight as an extra virtue. The film works so well not just because of its historical parallels but also because it spoofs gangster films and not just the cross-dressing joke. Overall it is a wonderful film that sparkles along to its glitzy Academy Awarding winning costume design."
"Why don't they make 'em like they used to? Marilyn, Jack, Tony, Joe E. Brown, George Raft, etc....you just can't compile a cast like that anymore. Perhaps that's what makes the film work so well, the casting.  As in all Wilder films, everyone was *just* right for their part, and trying to come up with alternatives proves fruitless, especially for Marilyn's role [what can be said about her that hasn't been said before? The ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" sequence is one of the sexiest in cinema, and it was accomplished completely through suggestion.  Notice Wilder's extremely effective use of the spotlight in combination with the black and white cinematography;  Marilyn never looked more luminous].I really can't imagine Frank Sinatra in the Tony Curtis role (Wilder's first choice, apparently), because Curtis does an amazing job, as does Lemmon. They are convincing as women without going over the top (although Lemmon comes close), and Curtis's Cary Grant impression was spot-on. Wilder was a genius, pure and simple.  Who has had a better track record? [Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Witness For The Prosecution, One Two Three, Lost Weekend, Double Indemnity (another universally acknowledged masterpiece), Ace In The Hole, Sunset Boulevard.....the list just goes on and on].What's supremely interesting about this movie is that, over the past 40 years, its appeal has not waned.  It's just as raucous and hilarious now as it was then, albeit less shocking.  But if you want shocking, go see Scary Movie.  And if you want comedy (the best of all time, no less), go see Some Like It Hot.  So good it should be required viewing.Note:  Another reviewer commented that Marilyn seemed ""chunky,"" but this is because she had a real woman's body, not the ""anorexic with implants"" image we are weaned on in today's world; this is the secret to her enduring sex appeal.  If Pamela Anderson Lee were playing Sugar, would it be half as sexy (or half as funny) as it is today?"
"This is a wonderfully entertaining film that has to have one of the best final scenes in movie history--seeing Joe E. Brown and Jack Lemmon in this scene is truly delightful. However, I do wonder if perhaps, maybe, the film is a tiny bit overrated--especially since it is now ranked relatively high on IMDb's Top 250 list. It's an exceptional film...I just don't see it as quite THAT exceptional.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon stumble upon a mob hit. And, since mobsters really DON'T like witnesses, they know they'd better hide--and quick. So they hit upon the idea of hiding in an all-ladies' band, as they, too, are musicians. There, Tony falls in love with Marilyn Monroe--and it's hard for him to balance his female persona with the bookish guy he also pretends to be to impress her. As for Jack, he becomes the focus of a rich older man's attentions (Joe E. Brown). So how do they both balance these relationships with a strong desire NOT to be killed by the mob? The film has some nice supporting acting by George Raft and Pat O'Brien-and it's nice to see them return to films. As for the acting, it's generally very good, though I think Curtis' acting is a bit broad at times--but oddly charming as well.Overall, there's a lot to enjoy and it's fun throughout."
"Two musicians--Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon)--accidentally witness a gangland murder set up by Spats Colombo (George Raft). They disguise themselves as women (Joe becomes Josephine and Jerry becomes Daphne) and join an all girls band traveling to Florida. Also in the band is Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and both the men fall madly in love with her.Classic comedy. I've seen it at least 10 times and I laugh out loud at it each time. It's fast-moving with a hilarious script. When I first saw this I was afraid there would be gay jokes made at the expense of Curtis and Lemmon. There isn't one! The script beautifully side steps any offensive material. Even when Curtis asks Lemmon, ""Why would a guy want to marry another guy"" Lemmon says, ""Security!"" The acting is mostly great. Curtis and Lemmon are just perfect and play off each other very well. Curtis actually looks pretty attractive as a woman! Monroe is just OK. She hated making this movie--she kept flubbing her lines and looks overweight (especially during her big musical number). Raft is pretty lousy--very stone-faced. But he's barely in the movie so it doesn't hurt things. It's filmed in black and white which actually helps--I think Lemmon and Curtis would have looked pretty awful in color as girls. So--a classic comedy with plenty of laughs and a famous last line--""Nobody's perfect"". Well worth seeing again and again. I give this a 10."
"""Some Like It Hot"" has to be one of the cleverest comedies.Billy Wilder's comic ideas were always a cut above. Two musicians, Joe and Jerry by chance go to pick up a car which just happens to be the garage where the St Valentine's Day massacre is taking place.How do you make a comedy on that idea? Talk about broad and brave.Tony Curtis as Joe and Jack Lemmon as Jerry are likable and brash.When they become women to escape the gangsters they become sensitive, vulnerable and extremely funny. They join an all girl swing band to get out of Chicago and travel by train down to Florida.Marylyn Monroe appears as Sugar Kane and the film becomes even more special.Not only is she sweet,vulnerable,sexy and funny -- she is the core to what makes the film great.There is no one to touch her.Talk about rehearsed spontaneity!They always talk about how she kept everyone waiting and how unreliable she was -- Well you can see from every frame in this film that Billy Wilder could not in any way have been easy to work for-- He expected perfection-- the comedy in this film is so precise bordering on genius.Joe E Brown is hysterically funny as Osgood -- and Jack Lemmon has a brilliantly funny transformation from harassed male in drag to goldigging future fiancé of Osgood after there passion filled tango.Tony Curtis has a difficult job as Joe , it is a generously straight performance.I especially liked his suppressed fierce reaction as he clambers out of the bath when riled by Jerry.This film is ""perfect"""
"When things are down, and you want a nice change to lift your spirits - go rent 'Some Like it Hot'. Will make you forget all your worries and give you a good time, it atleast did for me.The movie is about two guys (Lemmon and Curtis) who cross-dress as women to play with an all-girl band. From there on it's just laughs and more laughs. To finish up, the immortal final line ""Nobody is Perfect!""Perfect entertainment for the whole family, Marilyn Monroe beautiful as ever and some unforgettable dialogues:Daphne - Have I got things to tell you! I am engaged! Josephine - Who is the lucky girl? Daphne - I am!I can watch the movie a thousand times over and not get tired, 10/10!!"
"This movie, hands down, definitely showcases some of the best comedic talent I have ever seen.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are HILARIOUS and Marilyn is as gorgeous as ever...if you have not seen this movie, you are doing yourself a major disservice."
"Two Musicians happens two become witness of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago and to escape they join a all-woman band that is going to Florida.Curtis, Lemmon and Monroe are fantastic in this film together. I think it's their best comedy roles. The script must be one of the funniest ever written. A superb dialogue and not one boring scene in the whole film. This is the first Billy Wilder film I see, Now I will soon watch ""The Apartment"".I understand why this is called one of the greatest comedy's of all times. A comic masterpiece that I think I will see over and over again. 10/10"
"It isn't the first time men were in drag on the screen and certainly not the last, but surely it must be the funniest example.I'll skip the plot and just make a few offhand observations. One is that the writers put a near-perfect polish on this script. They didn't simply throw gags and comic situations into the story hoping they would all add up to a funny movie. Instead they worked running gags into the dialog. Some of them are so utterly without symbolic -- or even sensible -- content that they become in themselves sidesplitting. ""Type O blood."" It must come up half a dozen times in outrageously irrelevant contexts.And one that took me at least ten viewings to catch. I will now spell it out in case anyone out there is as dull as I've been. Near the beginning, when Joe and Jerry are still Joe and Jerry, Joe pitches some woo to Nellie Wymeyer in order to borrow her car, a Hupmobile 1929. An hour into the film, long after this brief exchange has been forgotten, Josephine has cornered Sugar on ""his"" yacht and explains to her the origin of his impotence. It's an imaginative and tragic tale. It seems he met his only true love at the Grand Canyon. She was as blind as he was. They stood together on the edge of the highest cliff. He took off his glasses. She took off her glasses. He took a step towards her. She took a step towards him. ""Oh, no!"" cries Sugar. ""Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up -- by mule."" That's not the running gag though. The running gag is that while Josephine is improvising this blatantly phony yarn, making it up as he goes along, free associating, he mentions that the girl he loved was named Nellie and that her father was president of Hupmobile. Absolutely nothing more is made of the connection between Nellie Wymeyer's Hupmobile and this baloney Josephine is slicing -- in fact he skips rather blithely over it.I don't think I'll give away any other gags, which means I can't really describe the movie in any detail.But mention should be made of the score and the arrangements of the contemporary tunes, for which I guess Adolph Deutsch is responsible. They're wacky when that's called for and sweet in an old-fashioned way when ballads are required. ""Stairway to the Stars"" has never sounded so romantic, and ""I'm Through With Love"" more wistful. (Catch the key change after Monroe finishes singing.) The underscore is remarkable too -- a frenetic combination of bass and tenor saxophone. (What else?) Monroe seems a bit thick waisted but it doesn't detract from her sex appeal because she's so Hollywood gorgeous. That transparent dress she almost has on during her love scene with Tony Curtis doesn't dampen her appeal either.The two male leads give unimpeachable performances. I know Tony Curtis has often been criticized for his ""mannerisms"" and his accent but they fit his character well enough in the Bing Crosby part, while Jack Lemon couldn't be improved upon in the Bob Hope part of the continually hoodwinked, constantly cackling breathlessly. All the supports are just about right too. Sid Polyakoff -- ""Spielt mit der PhilharMONic!"" And where on this planet did casting find all those goons who play George Raft's companions. ""These are my lawyers. All Harvard men."" Those FACES.I can't find anything bad to say about the movie. It's funny from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to catch it when you have a chance."
"Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe are just a brilliant comedy trio in this timeless comedy. I say timeless because I'm watching this film over 65 years after it was released and I'm still laughing my ass off. I love Some Like it Hot, I love everything about it, especially Monroe's sexiness. I wish that was the standard for women these days. But really, everything about the film is great: From Lemmon and Curtis' crazy attempts to hook up with Monroe's character, Sugar to the creepy old guy who apparently likes large ugly women who look like men. It's a great movie, and one of my personal favorites. It's funny throughout and just has that sense of joy all the time. It always puts a big smile on my face."
"Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are musicians in 1929 Chicago. They witness a mob hit, and go on the run with an all girls act on a train to Florida. Then Marilyn Monroe walks by, and movie magic is made.Director Billy Wilder writes some great sharp dialog. Jack Lemmon gives a hilarious performance as he falls for the delicious Marilyn Monroe while fighting off the advances of wealthy Osgood Fielding III. Then he takes a left turn, and it becomes comedy classic. Meanwhile Tony Curtis plays triple roles. And there's nothing better than Marilyn Monroe singing 'I Wanna Be Loved by You'. She's more than her ditsy blonde bombshell persona."
"Having just enjoyed last year's 'My Week with Marilyn', where Michelle Williams plays Marilyn Monroe, the epilogue says that Some Like It Hot was her next film and how it was a huge hit.After the semi-scandalous shenanigans that occurred during the filming of that crazy, doomed film in question - The Prince and the Showgirl, it indeed would be very fitting to re-watch (the sixth, or seventh time?) this bubbly frothy classic, that actually starts out as a Prohibition- set gangster movie.Few films manage to instill one with excitable anticipation at a seventh viewing but this Billy Wilder scripted/directed one still does. It's more than mere comedy, it has literally everything with a perfect cast playing, well, perfectly, with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag (to fool the gangsters after witnessing a shooting) one of the most enduring double acts of all time. And, of course, the real shame is that Marilyn wasn't able to treat us to more of this sort that she plays so naturally - she really does shines and fizzes effervescently.It's indeed, the subtle but clever innuendo that is the icing on the cake - we don't need to be shown any more or hear anything stronger to know exactly what is going on. This helps makes it so timeless.Many know and love the film and cite it as one of their all-time favourites - it's to them that I say, sometimes you need the merest of an excuse to indulge, as you would with some special chocolates or fancy bottle of wine. Some Like It Hot is the perfect antidote to dark, wet and stormy afternoons, is non-fattening and actually very good for you, as laughter is indeed, the best medicine. It remains an essential DVD for every collection - sometimes only the best comedy will do!"
"This is one of the funniest movies ever made, and I can't believe anyone wouldn't enjoy it.  Lemmon and Curtis give their best performances and Marilyn is heaven (though I've heard she was difficult to work with).  Add George Raft and the great Joe E. Brown, and it rarely gets better than this. No matter how many times I hear the last line spoken, I laugh every time."
"Billy Wilder was best known for dramas DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE LOST WEEKEND & SUNSET BLVD. but taste where changing and he added a new partner I.A.L. Diamond. And he wanted to get back to his roots when he wrote screwball comedies like BALL OF FIRE, NINOTCHKA and MIDNIGHT.Top 10 interesting things about SOME LIKE IT HOT1) This is actually the third version of the story after the 1935 - French film and 1951 - German musical version. Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond changed it to 1920s gangster/prohibition setting and added St. Valentine's Day like massacre plot and cast 1930's actors Pat O'Brien, George E. Stone and George Raft as gangsters. Look for Edward G. Robinson Jr. (son of the Edward G. Robinson) to jump out of the cake near the end of the film!2) Danny Kaye and Bob Hope or Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis where all considered to secure studio financing with Mitzi Gaynor as the girl. But when Marilyn Monroe heard about the film she wrote to Wilder asking if she could be in it after the success they had with 1955's THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH. So after she was signed for $200,000 and 10% of the gross Wilder was then able to cast the cheaper newcomers he really wanted, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as the male leads.3) Lemmon and Curtis were afraid of their young careers getting damaged, of the make-up & costumes not working and especially walking in high heels... they did hire a trainer but fired him after they realized walking like men in heels was funnier! 4) George Raft who started his career as a coin tossing gangster in the original 1932 SCARFACE was originally a dancer and taught Jack Lemmon & Joe E. Brown to tango so well, watch closely, they even pass a rose between their teeth while dancing!5) Supposedly when costume designer Orry-Kelly was measuring all three stars for dresses, he half-jokingly told Marilyn Monroe, ""Tony Curtis has a nicer rear end than you,"" at which point Monroe pulled open her blouse and said, ""Yeah, but he doesn't have a chest like this!"" Film critic Roger Ebert notes: ""she wears a clinging, see-through dress, with gauze covering the upper slopes of her breasts, the neckline scooping to a censor's eyebrow north of trouble."" 6) In 2008, a Californian man (who found a little black dress in his closet) was stunned when appraisers for U.S. TV series ""Antiques Roadshow"" determined it once belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The frock - which Monroe was sewn into for SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959) - was estimated to be worth $250,000 7) Tony Curtis came up with the idea to having his character Shell Oil Jr. sound like Cary Grant, who upon seeing the film said ""Nobody talks like that!""8) Marilyn Monroe was famously fragile, shy, insecure and often late. Wilder said a scene that would normally take an hour to shoot took 3 days to get right. It required 47 takes to get ""It's me, Sugar"" correct. Another scene required Monroe to rummage through some drawers and say ""Where's the bourbon?"" After 40 takes, Wilder pasted the correct line in one of the drawers. After Monroe became confused about which drawer contained the line, Wilder had it pasted in every drawer. When she finally does say it, she has her back to the camera, leading some to wonder if Wilder finally gave up and had it dubbed. The girls in the band tell the story of one day they couldn't get Marilyn out of her trailer so Wilder asked Monroe's stand-in to rehearse the song ""Running Wild"" with the crew. Before long Marilyn heard the music and someone else singing her song so she came out to see what was going on Wilder took one look at her and said, ""OK everybody, now from the top"" and Marilyn nailed it on the first take!SOME LIKE IT HOT director Billy Wilder was once asked why he put up with Monroe's nonsense. He famously replied, ""My Aunt Minnie would always be punctual and never hold up production, but who would pay to see my Aunt Minnie?"" 9) RECOGNITION: 6 Oscar nominations for Writing, Director, Cinematography, Sets and Lemmon for Actor (unfortunately that year it was competing with BEN-HUR which in my opinion is not that funny and Charlton Heston wears an even shorter skirt! Not fair!) SOME LIKE IT HOT only won only one Academy Award for Best Costume (FOOTNOTE: for strategic engineering under substantial and natural monumental obstacles, I'm sure.) Golden Globe wins for Best Comedy, Actor Lemmon & Actress Monroe; the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency awarded it a ""condemned"" rating (it's now considered PG-13) and finally in the year 2000, the American Film Institute listed SOME LIKE IT HOT as the number one greatest American comedy film of all time. What's number two? TOOTSIE...10) One last piece of trivia, about my favorite scene. When they previewed the movie they found a problem with one scene, the audience was laughing so hard they missed several jokes so Billy Wilder gave a pair of maracas to Jack Lemmon to shake between the punch lines and re- shot the scene to allow the audience time to get the laughs out of there system!"
"This is to me quintessential Billy Wilder, spoofing the gangster genre and cheekily bending the genders in a joyous romp that is standing the test of time in this perceived new age of movie watchers. The cries of it being a one joke movie don't carry weight because the final result is two hours of tongue in cheek winking entertainment that shatters that particular charge.The cast here are uniformly excellent, Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis bounce of each other in a sort of lowest denominator camp extreme that makes for mirth in abundance, and Monroe may just give the greatest spoof {of herself} performance in cinema history as she plays up perfectly to her image so played out in the press of the time. George Raft throws his lot in with a delightful caricature show, whilst Joe E Brown almost steals the film as Osgood, in fact he gets the icing on the cake final line that is now considered right at the top of the tree for closing lines.The off screen troubles with Monroe are some source of reference, and it really isn't my wish to waffle about stories that are available to you at a click of your mouse, what we know is that Wilder with the help of I.A.L. Diamond managed to create a much loved film that all involved can take as a legacy of success that the masses will enjoy for generations to come, it is what it is, 10/10."
"Yep -- the poster, with Marilyn winking over the shoulders of Lemmon and Curtis, says it all.Sometimes, the whole is LESS than the sum of its parts. For there may be no more delightful PARTS in the history of film, than these scenes. Yet the whole, curiously, doesn't quite add up.Probably because the entire premise -- two male jazz musicians passing as women to escape the Mafia -- devolves into the notorious final, utterly improbable, line: ""Nobody's perfect!"" But by then any pretext at reality has been dropped. We are immersed in some Neverland of movie-making which, really, has never been attempted before or since.Namely, a thoroughly ridiculous vanity film for the director, writers, cinematographer and actors that remains utterly delightful nearly half a century later -- and always will.About halfway through, audiences realize they're not watching anything resembling real life. Instead, they're watching some of the best talents in the business having fun! And fun it is! The script is tight as a drum: the direction is flawless (particularly in light of the on-set problems with Miss Monroe): the cinematography is luscious (never has Monroe been lit and photographed so successfully; not even in ""The Prince and the Showgirl."").Yet what we're given is scene after scene with two masterful actors -- Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis -- masquerading as women. And Marilyn Monroe -- masterful in her narrow range -- also masquerading as a woman.Let's face it: without her voluptuous body (and Orry-Kelly's jaw-dropping costumes), Miss Monroe would have been NOTHING had she been Kate Moss. Or any other actor. Imagine ANYBODY else ""breathing"" those lines and slinking around in those gowns and getting by with it.You can't.Every scene ""works."" Lemmon and Curtis are priceless -- particularly Curtis -- in female drag. Not for one second do they condescend to ""playing"" women. Sure, the plot demands it. But there's not a moment where they're ""putting down"" the ""weaker"" sex. That would have been an easy ""comedic"" choice back in the day. That nobody chose it says a lot about the talents and sensibilities at work here.Only Joe E. Brown could have been cast as Osgood, perhaps. So obliviously innocent is he that he makes his love for ""Daphne"" work without a hint of homosexual subtext.It may be a small miracle, in fact, that a film of this era, dealing with two men in drag, and an older wealthy man in love with one of them, has absolutely NO hint of homosexuality, much less anti-gay sentiment. The film is, truly, beloved in homosexual circles for precisely that reason.But forget all that. ""Some Like It Hot"" becomes a tour-de-force for everybody involved: a film about the joys of acting and pretending, rather than a film to be believed or taken seriously -- since it's so preposterous.One finally yields to the audacious conceit that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are ""believed"" as ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"" and simply lets the deliciousness of their playing wash over audiences.The tidal wave that is Marilyn Monroe (though nearly impossible to work with, by this point: her lines being pasted inside bureau drawers and anywhere else on the set that couldn't be seen, because she couldn't recall even the simplest of them), is perhaps the ultimate in feminine pulchritude on screen. (Monroe was reportedly pregnant during filming, though she miscarried.) Forget that she's written (and plays) a woman as dumb as a post. She looks like nothing anybody ever saw before or since.So ""Some Like It Hot"" works, scene by scene. Yet, curiously, if fails in the end because it's so patently phony.No matter the era, when a man proposes to another man (thinking he's a woman), and that fiancée pulls off his wig and confesses, ""I'm a man,"" the last line is NEVER, ""Well, nobody's perfect."" No matter how funny. No matter ANYTHING. By then we're in Neverland and all that's left is to relish the performers relishing performing.That, we do."
Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is a masterpiece.  Everything just seems to work in the film -- even forty years later!  Jack Lemmon plays the goofball brilliantly; Tony Curtis is a wonderful leading man; and Marilyn Monroe is an absolute joy to watch!  She's such a tease!!!Great fun for the anyone who loves to laugh!
"What else could you expect from director Billy Wilder but a masterpiece when he's given such s terrific cast and good script like he had for ""Some like it hot"".  I mean, if you've seen ""Sunset boulevard"", ""Stalag 17"" and ""Witness for the prosecution"", it's impossible to think that ""Some like it hot"" might be kind of boring and anyway, if you think it's going to be boring, you're wrong.  Also, you might not have noticed, but most comedies (except for Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" and a few others of his) rarely hit the big-time or become timeless classics.  However, it was nice to see that AFI recognized ""Some like it hot"" as being a terrific comedy and they ranked it 14th on their 100 greatest American films.  Two good friends, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis), witness a murder by one of the biggest gangsters but manage to escape but instead of running to the police, they decide to hide from the gangsters by dressing up as two women who play in a band (I forgot to mention that their job is to play in a band). It's on the trip with that band that they meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and they naturally both fall in love with her.  The rest of the movie is pure comedy and I don't want to spoil the fun for anybody so I guess you'll just have to see it.  The movie also has some great scenes like the one where Curtis imitates Cary Grant.  It's worth at least two good watches if not three."
"''Some Like It Hot'' is the best movie with Marilyn Monroe already made! When I was deciding which movie from Marilyn's box I was going to watch, ''Some Like it Hot'' was the one which I payed less attention of them: the cover is not beautiful as ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes '' or ''How to Marry a Millionaire'' and the fact that the movie was black and white made it less appealing to me. Anyway, I decided to watch and I don't regret it at all: I had a lot of fun with the story!:) ( And by the way, I saw how handsome Jamie Lee Curtis' father, Tony Curtis, was.)Joe and Jerry are friends and musicians. They two are broke and needing to pay their bills, so they go to almost all opportunities of a job they can get. One day, when they decided to take a job in a very distant place, they become witnesses of a massacre,leaded by Spats Colombo, a guy from the Italian Mafia. The problem is that Spats and his gang noticed that Jerry and Joe were there, and now they are hunting both musicians to kill them. Needing to hide, Joe and Jerry decided to cover their identity, and they both dress up like women: Joe becomes Josephine and Jerry becomes Daphne, and they get a job in a women's band. Once they arrive in Miami, many problems and confusions starts to happen, since Joe is using two identities (one as ''shell junior', the millionaire, to make Sugar fall for him)and Jerry is having problems with a rich old man who is in love with ''Daphne''.To make things worst, the mafia came to Miami as well."
"After being sanctimoniously warned by Joe about his lust, why would Jerry help him woo Sugar by allowing Osgood to romance him, especially after blasting Joe for his Junior act?Sugar thinks Junior is loaded, but he's such a jerk, why is she so willing? How could Joe fit into Beinstock's clothes? How did he know what kind of clothes Beinstock had packed to begin with? How could Jerry fit into the bellhop's uniform? Why did everyone accept Joe and Jerry as women except Spats and his thugs? Despite the fact that Mulligan is there, and the hotel is a public place, Little Bonaparte orders a hit. Makes sense to me, too!How did Sugar know Joe had gone to the pier after he was chased out of the ballroom by Little Bonaparte's goons? And even if her bicycle was jet-propelled, there is no way in hell she could have gotten there before he, Jerry, and Osgood shoved off!But it's so terrific and so perfectly executed with its perfect cast, you're more than happy to forgive its many faults. While I loved Monroe's performance, this pup is Lemmon's all the way! The scene with Monroe in the train berth and with Curtis after their dates make me scream every time!"
"Opening in 1929 in Chicago musicians Joe and Jerry witness a mob assassination, committed by Spats Colombo, so have to go on the run. There are jobs with a band that is heading to Miami... there is just one catch; they are all girls. By the time the train is ready to head south Joe and Jerry have become Josephine and Daphne. On the journey they get to know the other girls and as Joe talks to singer Sugar and learns how she hopes to meet a bespectacled millionaire with a yacht rather than the usual succession on no-good saxophone players (Joe plays the Sax). Once in Miami sets about becoming just that man while a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III, is attracted to Jerry's 'Daphne'! If that weren't enough Spats is in in town for a mob conference.This film may be in black and white and almost sixty years old but don't let that put you off; it is still fresh and very funny. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great as 'Josephine' and 'Daphne'; they may not be the most beautiful of women but they do at least look feminine enough that one can believe they would be mistaken for women. Marilyn Monroe is on top form as Sugar; particularly in the scenes were she is wooed by Joe's 'Shell Oil Jnr' persona. The laughs come thick and fast combining elements of farce and slapstick. One might worry that 'fifties morality' would be a problem but the attitudes are far more modern than one might expect. Overall I'd definitely say this film is a must see."
"A couple of days ago I saw this movie for the very first time. It was an extra credit film for my Film History class that I am taking currently. I have seen many black and white films before but nothing compared to this one. From the first scene to the end credits my mind was on a complete roller coaster ride. I was very impressed with the main characters and how the actor/actresses playing them held their own throughout the entire film.The way the two main actors portrayed the two women throughout the entire was really impressive. This is a film I would recommend because it combines humor,suspense, romance, and violence in a unique way that really captures the time period it was filmed in. I can clearly say that this film for me was really enjoyable and nothing like I expected it to be. I hope it is enjoyable for others as much as it was enjoyable for me!!!"
"Humor, beyond the pure pleasure of laughter, can provide insights into the rules, norms and taboos of the times that by showing the distortion that provides release. At the time this was made, it was focused on a bygone era of murderous mobsters and their living sex toys.Not only were gender roles defined, there were to the degree that the issue hadn't even been raised, neither in the time of depiction 1929 or three decades later when the film was made. The fun was that all it took for men to gambol with the chicks was their putting on dresses and wigs, and raising their voice an octave.The DVD shows the complete film with commentary by the son of billy Wilder's co-writer, Babaloo Mandell along with Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis, describing more than the technical aspects Most touching were how Marilyn Monroe resonated to the fictional character. Curtis, without any bravado, told of how his on stage scene when he convinced her that he was impotent, and with tenderness and passion she ""cured"" him, echoed their actual love affair previously.We also see the genius of writer director Billy Wilder at work in a way that can't be described outside of such a film as this where his interpersonal and literary talents were at play. While this is appropriately in the genre of comedy, it is really so much more. It is a love story, and a tale of the tragedy of the real Norma Jeane that was never far away from the actress. Sure, at times the pain of her early life (see Wikipedia) broke through to the detriment of efficiency of the filming. But so what? The film on one level provided laughter, but on another insight into the human condition.It is also a benchmark of sexual stereotypes where the setup for that final memorial line, the universal absurdity of the disclosure that the object of sexual desire would not make a suitable wife because, ""I'm a guy."" This was a world where women could roll in bed together without any thought of sexuality between them, and the joke was there were two who were pretending, only playing a role, performing a part.How far the world has come, a truth that must be acknowledged whether pleased or disturbed by the revolution. And the coda, ""Nobody's Perfect"" takes on a more profound irony behind the laughter."
"Of course, of course _ ""Some Like it Hot"" is arguably the greatest screwball comedy in the history of Hollywood. But, as they say, the devil is in the details. One of those details _ casting _ could have instantly derailed this classic. Who to dress up in drag with Tony Curtis, run from the mob led by George Raft and hook up with Marilyn Monroe at her most sensuous? Oh, and to field a marriage proposal from Joe E. Brown despite a, uh, gender issue? And by the way, what actor to play over the top without taking his own brilliance too seriously and ruining the whole shebang for everybody? On the 25th anniversary of the film, I acted as host-interviewer of ""An Evening with Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond"" and got a rare peek behind the scenes and an up-close look at both Wilder and Jack Lemmon, the actor who met the aforementioned requirements perfectly. I hope you find the following story amusing. Among other things, it illustrates that, no matter how high the budget and how big the stars, film is still an art form and chemistry matters, and that chemistry is very often predicated on serendipity and just plain luck.)IN Hollywood, they say it's not what you know, but who you know. They might have added, it's also who you know if you run into each other at a serendipitous time.I acted as host-interviewer for ""An Evening with Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond"" on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of ""Some Like It Hot."" Great stories.Wilder lived up to his reputation as one of Hollywood's great wits and raconteurs. A dervish behind thick Coke-bottle glasses chomping on an ever-present cigar stub, he was at once elegant and raw, a man who had fled the Nazis, pulled himself up by the bootstraps through talent and guile, and beaten Hollywood at its own game.Jack Lemmon was just a nice guy. REALLY. The quintessential Hollywood Everyman, even nicer and more accommodating off-screen than on, which was saying a bunch.He and Wilder would have one of the industry's great collaborative friendships. But not just yet. And this is how it started.Lemmon told me he did not know Wilder well when, as luck would have it, he happened to be dining with his future wife, Felicia Farr, at Delmonico's restaurant one early Sunday evening at the same time as Wilder. The great director spied him and dropped by his table later on the way out.Wilder, as was his way, came right to the point. ""Gunna do dis story where you'd dress up in drag and run avay vit a girls' band after seeing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre _ vonna do it?"" he asked the startled actor (and who played startled better than Lemmon?).Recalled Lemmon while sitting in his office (his Oscar for 1972's ""Save the Tiger"" gleaming on a shelf behind him): ""In that one sentence, I had the whole story. For the first time, I took a role without having seen the script.""And we all know the result.Oh well, nobody's perfect."
"Actually, it has been 54 years since this movie released. And I live in far away from United States of America. So, I think there are a lot of tolerance that I must have, so I can enjoy this movie. Yes, and I still elicit a smile on the some ""spots"" in the movie. The comedy, however, is everlasting. And the plot itself, is real amusing.I don't judge it from the beauty of the star, like Marilyn Monroe. What I can say is that every character act is well yet comical. They are very relax in did an act. Other actor also all-out in their acting. Very great, although after a half of century.The last thing, I must give an appreciation of the superb plot. It is a real tricky comedy, serious but straight comedy. I just can say, what a real fun!"
"Some Like It Hot is an American comedy film, made during 1958 and released during 1959, which was directed by Billy Wilder. This comedy made controversy out of its use of not very common themes in the cinema theaters. The use of themes like homosexuality, mafia and gangster difficulties, and alcoholism were all themes that were not common at all during the ages of the 1950s. The use of stereotypes as blondes symbolized as dumb and unconsciously acting women, gangsters as selfish and crude men, and musicians as poor and needy people make the movies way of description easier since just by getting to know the characters you know what they are and what they want. It all starts at an old 1950s Chicago, when Jerry and Joe, two musicians escape from the closure of an illegal pub. They run away with no where to go and look for jobs since they are almost money- less. The most valuable things they have are their instruments. They find out about a band who is leaving in tour and needs two musicians, but the problem is that the band is composed by all female musicians, so they reject the job. After looking for other jobs Joe and Jerry happen to become witnesses of a mafia murder so they run away again but this time away from the mafia. For them to get away from the area they finally take the female band tour and leave with the other female musicians as if they were women. Everything happens to go well as they pretend to be female musicians but someone intervenes in their plans, and that someone is Sugar, interpreted by Marylyn Monroe. She happens to be a really beautiful but dumb girl who is part if the band. They both fall in love with her. They finally reach their destination, Miami, Florida. They get there and another character appears, he is Osgood. He falls in love of the female version of Jerry, Daphne. The story goes on and Joe tries to make Sugar fall in love with a fake millionaire version of him, and it sorts to work out. Joe got the idea that Jerry should take Osgood, the money-abundant old man, dressed as Daphne out for a dinner to a Latin bar at the coast, while Joe dressed as the fake millionaire version of him takes Sugar with him into Osgood's yacht at the beach. The morning after it happened that Daphne and Osgood got engaged, Osgood without knowing that Daphne is in reality Jerry. Sugar is sad because her ""new loved man"" has gone. Jerry and Joe find out that the Mafia convention is taken place in the same hotel they are in. The gangsters happen to recognize both Jerry and Joe as women and look for them. They hide and happen to witness another murder but his time the murder of the gangsters who were following them. Now the new gangster follow them and Joe has this idea in which he could reveal himself to Sugar and take her with him and Daphne to Osgood's yacht where they left together as two couples, Sugar and the real Joe, and Osgood and Daphne, who in reality is Jerry. Osgood doesn't care he is a man. All of these events go around the themes I mentioned. Homosexuality is highlighted when Osgood doesn't care about Daphne's sex and when Joe, as a woman loves Sugar. Gangster and Mafia problematics when they witness and are followed by the mafia in both cities, Chicago and Miami. The story made controversy when it was revealed to the audience since they weren't used to themes of that big impact in society. In my opinion the movie has to fix some details as the cast acting skills and the short and brief ending. Everything else in the movie is mostly good. The settings, the music, the filming techniques, and many other characteristic that build a great movie."
"""Some Like It Hot""It is a very interesting movie considering that it was made in 1959 in black and white, when color cinema already existed. It is a combination of screwball comedy, romantic comedy, thriller and gangster. With great music and an ingenious screen writing by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. The director is also Billy Wilder.The movie is set in 1929, during the time of the Prohibition. It starts when two Chicago musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon) have to run from the police. In the middle of the little chaos, the same luck brings them to witness a murder on Valentine's Day. Making them two wanted men by Chicago's mafia. While they are looking for a job, they find a vacant on a girl band group for saxophone and bass players, respectively the instruments they both play. In the desperation, they disguise as women and join the band. They name themselves Josephine (Joe) and Daphne (Jerry). While in the girl band, Joe falls in love with Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and an old millionaire man, Osgood Fielding (Joe E Brown), falls in love with Daphne. Making it funnier because Osgood does not know that Daphne is a guy.All of the main actors did an excellent performance, considering that it is seen as one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are both dramatic and funny, which engages the audience with both of them. On the other hand, Marilyn Monroe is probably the most complex character. She acts as a more ""elegantly vulgar"" character and female drinker. She portrays the woman dependent of a man. And many have criticized the scene when she appears singing 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' with a nude color dress, and the lighting focused on a way that she appears to be naked.I loved the scene when Joe is sitting on the bench while the girls are in the beach because it gives the plot a major turn around, creating a third character portrayed by Joe. And it complicates everything more. The fact of a lie on top of another lie and other lies, which give the audience a sense of suspense about how will it turn out. One scene that I did not specifically loved was when there is a second murderer because it looks a bit unrealistic and it is the same thing occurring all over again. An unrealistically bad luck.This movie was considered extremely controversial and was even banned in certain places like Kansas. The fact of Joe and Jerry transforming themselves into Josephine and Daphne creates a sexual confusion on the very conservative time period that the movie was made. As the director Curtis Hanson said about the movie: ""It's a film about sex – from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual attitudes, sexual roles and, of course, sexual identity."" The relationship of Osgood and Daphne was probably the most criticized one because it becomes bigger and bigger at the point of them being engaged and when Joe asks Jerry ""Who's the lucky girl?"", Jerry answers ""Me!."" This gave a sense of confusion because the character could not realize why could not he marry Osgood. Finally, when he confesses to Osgood ""I am a guy!"", this one replies ""Nobody's perfect."" Which leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and trying to convey an idea of sexual identity. But overall, it was a very good movie with beautiful scenery and an unusual plot. It is considered one of the funniest movies of all time, and even though it was a bit controversial when it came out, it is nothing that you would not see in movies nowadays. This movie has been considered to be a screwball comedy, which is a type of comedy that "" distinguishes itself for being characterized by a female that dominates the relationship with the male central character, whose masculinity is challenged."" It is also a romantic comedy, where we can see the romances of Sugar and Joe, and Osgood and Daphne being a major part of the plot. A thriller, where we do not know what will happen and if someone will ever find out that they are guys. It leaves the audience waiting for the climax. Finally, it is also considered a gangster film, where it is a crime-dealing movie and the Chicago mafia is trying to capture Joe and Jerry. The movie won an Oscar for costume design in black and white and the music is also very nice. The song ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" had its most famous performance by Marilyn Monroe in this movie.I would give this movie a 4.3/5This review was written by a high school sophomore, who likes to listen to music and watch movies. It was written for a film appreciation class."
"No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points.The movie is perfectly cast. The chemistry between Lemmon and Curtis is perfect. Add a wide-eyed Monroe and it's an outstanding comedy trifecta. Still, seeing the film again after first release, I wonder how much hilarity audiences of today find in the movie's sexual innuendo. After all, the premise was cutting-edge in 1959 when the word 'panties' in Anatomy of a Murder raised a ruckus with enforcers of the film code.In that same year, just watching from a theatre seat during the cross-dressing, plus the many innuendo scenes was like being a daring part of taboo-breaking. The bawdy subtext was a totally new experience in the commercial movies. Thus the amusement factor was heightened by novel comedic material, previously forbidden. But I wonder about today's younger audiences for whom the innuendo may even seem a little tame, given today's almost non-existent standards.In my little book, it's still a funny movie, thanks mainly to an expert cast, but hardly an all- time topper as it is in some ratings lists. Besides, it's the only comedy I can think of to work its way around not just one, but two, on-screen massacres!"
"I haven't seen a more perfect comedy and cast than this in a while.Watching this in 2012 and I still find myself laughing my heads off. Thinking, ""So this is comedy cross-dressing is supposed to be."" (that is looking at you Big Momma and Tyler Perry) Ranked as the greatest American comedy by AFI (as at Oct 2012), the movie is a remake of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare d'Amour and was meant to be shut in color but as the makeup of both Curtis and Lemmon was obvious it was then shut in black and white.Marilyn Monroe can carve a M in to a rock with her smile and her acting is so well done that you are intrigued to see her anytime. Monroe is known mostly as a sex icon, and this movie assisted in such claims as the dresses she wore were more too seductive to be classified as funny. To say she had the movie by the balls will be a statement men will agree to, when they are watching this flick.The plot is about two male musicians who will do absolutely anything for money as they are constantly broke. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and witness a mobster performing his ""executionary"" duties. This made them run off while being shut at.To hide from their pending death, they took a job as musicians in an all-girl band. So to fit in they shaved their legs, wore makeup and wore a dress to pass as women.But things took a turn for the worse when Marilyn Monroe strolled by.The film was awarded an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. It also won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Marilyn Monroe won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy, and Jack Lemmon for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy.Billy Wilder the director is one of only five people to have won Academy Awards as producer, director, and writer for the same film (The Apartment). Tony Curtis has been in over a 100 films and he is the father of actress Jamie Lee Curtis.Lemmon is popular in these days as the actor in the movie Odd Couple.Some Like It Hot, is a movie I advise you watch over and over again. Like the last line of the movie goes ""Nobody is perfect"" I say I'm not the perfect comedy judge but I wanna know if you agree with me.www.lagsreviews.com"
"Although you can still somewhat describe this movie being somewhat of a screwball comedy, it's also really a movie that has more hints of a more modern type of comedy in it. The overall comedy and approach of it all and the story feels more matured and seriously put together, as if it was a movie out of a far more serious and respected genre, such as a drama or a thriller. It makes me sort of see ""Some Like It Hot"" as the first 'modern' comedy.In essence this is actually being one very simple movie. It relies almost entirely on its main premise of having two guys who are forced, due to circumstances, to dress up as girls and to join an all female band, in order to get away from the mobsters that are chasing them and want to kill them. But of course lots of other stuff starts to happen and things get complicated more once they start the trip. They get themselves even in more trouble, which is of course all due to Marilyn Monroe.It's perhaps Marilyn Monroe's most iconic and memorized roles. She never was the best actress around but she still always had an incredible screen presence, which made audiences fall in love with her. It was of course not in the least due to her looks but also thanks to her naive, girl-like charm. Besides, her singing was also always great and she does some good singing in this and sing her most recognizable song 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' in this. But you really shouldn't forget about Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. I mean, they are the ones acting in drag, mostly throughout the entire movie. They truly become almost unrecognizable, which is not just because of the way how they look but also due to their fine acting. I wouldn't imaging there were many actors at the time, fighting over a role to play a female character for almost the entire movie but they are the ones that simply did it and for that along they already should get a lot of respect.It's a pleasantly fast moving movie, that takes us to a lot of places and there is always something going on. The characters are great comedy ones and then I am of course also talking about its fine supporting cast, that also has some other quite big names in it from the past, such as George Raft and Pat O'Brien.One of the first great and successful 'modern' comedies.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"""Some Like It Hot"" is hard to explain. The film, if you've never seen it, is going to feel like something you've seen a hundred times before. And you probably have, but they did it first. To be successful, two guys dress up as women, and then one falls for a woman (Marilyn Monroe) -- so how does he tell her without her hating him for keeping the secret? We have seen plenty of films where guys get close to women because of some trick -- usually innocently -- and then have to inevitably reveal the truth. And sometimes this involves cross-dressing. I think it's safe to say that ""Some Like it Hot"" was the first film to play this plot, especially with the cross-dressing.This film is funny, to be sure, and has a very nice innocence to it in that it seems pretty obvious to the audience that the women are men. The broad shoulders, the weird bumps while wearing a swimsuit? How the girls don't catch on is beyond me. And then to not recognize the guys while in male clothing... wow."
