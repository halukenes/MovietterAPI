"What a wonderful way to spend an evening--dinner, Christmas and New Year's with CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) and 'friends', accompanied by much champagne and laughter, and spaghetti and meatballs lovingly prepared by the host himself. There's even a game of gin rummy to get into that Baxter and Fran can't ever seem to finish--here's hoping it never does!THE APARTMENT is one of those truly classic classic movies--for one thing, it has an absolutely top-notch cast, featuring Jack Lemmon (at his wryly humourous best); Shirley MacLaine (a glowing screen presence); Fred MacMurray (smarm personified); and a younger Ray Walston (still wisecracking, still hilarious). They also benefit from a clever, perceptive and timelessly relevant script by Billy Wilder, under his capable direction. Though there are plenty of brilliant one-liners, the best of the dialogue feels true and real, which adds to the feeling that you've known Baxter et al for years. I loved the score to the movie as well, artfully attributed to the Rickshaw Boys and used to great effect.There are so many good moments scattered throughout the film (I can't even begin to enumerate them all here!). A lot of them are little touches that must have been added by the actors themselves (Jack Lemmon humming as he prepares the meatball sauce is just *so* funny!). I love the madness of the Christmas party scene, and when Baxter's doctor-neighbour takes charge of the situation with Fran, slapping her awake and marching her around the living room. I also love it when Baxter first starts playing gin rummy with Fran, and she reveals how she has a talent for falling for the wrong guy all the time. Best of all, Lemmon makes such a believable, sweet pushover that you often want to shake him and hug him at the same time--the things he would do for Fran! It makes his final scene with MacMurray that much more satisfying for the audience.If you see this gem of a movie on a video store shelf, or (even better) playing in the cinema, don't let it pass you by. Join Baxter, Fran, Mr. Sheldrake and everyone else, and have a great time!"
"Ohhh - after my 4th or 5th viewing, I think this may be one of the most remarkable blends of comedy and drama to have ever been filmed - THE APARTMENT - in subtle ways - rises well above the conventions of any genre. It was my introduction to the great Billy Wilder, and my fondness for Jack Lemmon (a remarkable and sorely missed actor) begins here as well.*SOME SPOILERS* The cold take on the sex-and-money ethos to be found in many corporate environments hasn't dated one bit; it could be argued that THE APARTMENT stands a bit ahead of its' time in the depiction of (what would appear to be) educated employees treated like (and feeling like) tools to be used in generation of someone else's income. Lemmon's character never forgets that he's disposable, even if the optimist in him hopes that something better may be found in his superiors. Deep down he knows this to be a pipe dream - the sexual adventurism of those same superiors betrays their utter lack of ethics. Of course, Lemmon's character isn't entirely above it all; he's been more than willing to hire out his own apartment as a place for his colleagues' peccadilloes, in exchange for career advancement, which of course - as Wilder early on links amoral sexual conduct and professional/corporate/financial misconduct in a greater social critique - gets him into trouble.The dialogue is - as is always true with Wilder - very finely crafted, yet seems natural - this film is a remarkable display of the kind of reactions any of us would offer in similar situations. Interestingly, our two protagonists are also wonderfully imperfect as human beings - Lemmon and MacLaine bear some responsibility for the very serious situations they've gotten themselves into; they manage to realize this (""Be a mensch!"" Lemmon's doctor neighbor exclaims) just in time to set things right. MacLaine in particular delivers a remarkable, complex performance - sweet and smart in her earliest scenes, bleak and emotionally ravaged in her climactic scene with MacMurray, naive elsewhere, sharp but hopeful at the end. The cinematography captures the entire cast beautifully - with minimal movement, abundant long takes, and a sleek lack of visual clutter, all of the principals are free to reveal their own best and worst impulses, within an environment that is stripped of artifice. The end result is a film filled with great moments one can easily identify with."
"Written by the great filmmaker Billy Wilder, this is a serious, sardonic comedy for people who've known what's its like to feel the pressure of compromising your principles or your self- respect for the sake of getting ahead in life. And there are very few over the age of consent who haven't had to at one time or another. This isn't the laugh out loud comedy of Jim Carrey or the Farrelly brothers, but a subtle, nuanced comedy about two people who have both been jaded in love and yet continue to hope again and again that it will someday work out for them -- mainly because despite the unlikeable things they do, they are both basically decent, nice people. Flawed and even weak at times, but good people. This is a movie that doesn't just make it you laugh, it makes you think. A rare find indeed."
"Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment is his greatest accomplishment. It is his most successful melding of comedy and drama that he never quite pulled off again. I'm glad the Academy had enough good taste to award Wilder The Triple Crown: Best Picture/Director/Screenplay. But they still had enough bad taste to deny Jack Lemmon a Best Actor award, Shirley MacLaine a Best Actress award and Fred MacMurray a nomination and award.The plot this time: C.C. Baxter (Lemmon; in case you're wondering: ""C for Calvin C for Clifford, but most people call me ""Bud"")lends out his apartment to executives for their extramarital trysts in the faint hope of a promotion. Eventually, his boss, Sheldrake (MacMurray, excellent in a rare straight role) finds out and wants the key for his own affairs. Meanwhile, Baxter has a crush on Miss Kubelik (MacLaine, in a strong performance)the elevator operator.For those who accuse me of spoiling the whole movie: rest assured. This only covers the first 20 minutes or so of the 126 minute feature. Wilder has many twists and tricks up his sleeve and I'll leave you to discover what happens. What amazes me about ""The Apartment"" is that unlike most films, this isn't about the plot. It's a study in human nature and the mistakes they make. That is a strong trait of most Wilder films (including ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" and ""The Fortune Cookie"", both hilarious comedies with a hidden meaning)Also the dialogue by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond isn't just one-liners (although they are funny; especially when spoken by Lemmon and Ray Walston)There is real heartfelt sentiment here and it isn't the syrupy kind that makes my stomach churn (as in films like ""Patch Adams"") Wilder allows enough to make his points and then gets back to comedy.The cinematography is fabulous too. Wilder's film (as most of his 60s films) is in widescreen Black and White (shot by Joseph LaShelle, in Panavision; one of the most unsung and unrecognized cinematographers in history, he was nominated but lost) It has a crisp,clean look and is one of the few widescreen films that actually make the viewer feel confined in a tight space.""The Apartment"" is a superior example of the ""serious comedy"", films that work as both comedy and drama. Sadly, many of today's filmmakers have lost touch with this genre. I can't help but feel that the freedoms granted today that weren't in the 1950s and 60s haven't been an advance. They've been holding us back. Smart characters have lost way to stupid and oversexed ones. That's a real shame and it's high time we go back to our roots.**** out of 4 stars"
"Billy Wilder knew how to make a great movie. Of course it helps to have one of the greatest all-time actors, Jack Lemon, play in your movies, but Lemon aside, Wilder was a genius. His gift for the comedic moment showed brilliantly on screen and reached deep inside the audience.The Apartment, the last of the great Black and White films, showed a bit darker side to comedy than some of his other romps such as the hilarious Some Like It Hot. Some Like It Hot is just as funny today as it was in 1959. It is pure fun. At no point in the film are we approached with anything that we would take seriously. Let's face it, most of us are not running from the mob disguised as a member from the opposite sex.The Apartment, however, brings up much more human themes and issues. Wilder is an expert and at no time does he leave you worried that it will turn out badly. This is, after all, a comedy. One mistake in the script and the movie could quickly become a deep film about suicide, loneliness, and peer pressure, but Wilder balances the subjects on the edge of a knife and allows us to smile at what could otherwise be a very depressing movie.Wilder and his films like The Apartment are very similar to Shakespeare's comedies. It can be said that the difference between a Shakespeare comedy and tragedy is often not the story, but the ending. In a comedy, everyone is married; in a tragedy, everyone dies. the same is true with The Apartment, it all hinges on the outcomes. If Kubelik dies or Baxter is left alone, the movie would be a tragedy. But since they prevail in the end, the movie comes off as a great comedic success, albeit a bit dark."
"One of the finest examples of smart, satiric comedy-drama ever created for the screen. Jack Lemmon (in amazing comic form) plays a working stiff in Corporate America--via New York City--whose bachelor apartment inadvertently becomes a love-nest for amorous, married executives. The film is extremely modern for 1960 and features a non-stop barrage of funny, clever talk. Lemmon is a mad genius at frenzied (yet sympathetic) characterization, and ""The Apartment"" catches him at his professional peak in the movies. Working alongside huggable neurotic Shirley MacLaine (also at her peak) and shady Fred MacMurray (parlaying his slimeball role with curt persuasion), Lemmon creates a new kind of acting: screwball realism. **** from ****"
"In the recent biography of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov, it is mentioned that for the first time Wilder used as his protagonist a lovable loser. Think about it. In a whole lot of his previous films the main lead in Ace in the Hole, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17 are the people who are the takers as Shirley MacLaine describes Fred MacMurray here.In The Apartment, it's the schnook that's took who the story focuses on. Jack Lemmon creates one of his immortal characters in C.C. Baxter, a minor cog in the machinery of the insurance company he works for.Lemmon has maybe found a way to move up the corporate ladder, but it's driving him nuts. He lives on West 67 Street in Manhattan, a most convenient location for kanoodling. Only it isn't him that kanoodles. One time he allowed one of the middle level managers to use his apartment for a little nookie. One guy tells another and so on and so on and pretty soon Lemmon can't call his place his own.In walks big boss Fred MacMurray to seemingly save the situation. But it turns out he only wants exclusive use for himself and he actually does vault Baxter several steps up the corporate ladder. And unfortunately MacMurray is currently kanoodling with elevator operator Shirley MacLaine who Lemmon has a thing for.The Apartment was years ahead of its time in that it was one of the first major films to deal with sexual harassment. The whole group of middle executives Ray Walston, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, David White and the big cheese Fred MacMurray just look on that insurance company as one gigantic harem. As typical for 1960 note there are no women in any managerial positions at all.Fred MacMurray almost didn't play Mr. Sheldrake. Paul Douglas was cast originally, but died suddenly just before shooting on The Apartment commenced. MacMurray stepped in and got great critical reviews for another effort with Billy Wilder as a heavy. MacMurray was also starting at this time a long run in the family comedy My Three Sons on television. There would be no more bad guys in his future.Billy Wilder held out in casting for Jack Kruschen as Doctor Dreyfus the next door neighbor who is available to save Shirley MacLaine's life. The folks at United Artists were ready to sign Groucho Marx for the part. Wilder's faith in Kruschen was justified, he got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Peter Ustinov for Spartacus. Lemmon and MacLaine were also nominated for the leads, but failed to win. But The Apartment was chosen Best Film of 1960 and Billy Wilder was Best Director.Also look out for a biting performance by Edie Adams who really makes her role count as MacMurray's secretary and former flame. During a Christmas party she tips off MacLaine to MacMurray's philandering ways and then later on brings the house of cards all around Fred.The Apartment is so timeless in so many ways although women in the workplace have made great strides in the last 46 years. One thing though that does show how dated it is. It's mentioned that Lemmon pays $94.00 a month, presumably rent controlled, for a one bedroom apartment in the West Sixties in Manhattan.Now that is dated."
"In the beginning of The Apartment we see C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) being lost in a sea of desks within a gigantic office room. He works for a huge New York insurance company employing over thirty thousand souls spread over twenty-seven floors. Sometimes he is working overtime; ""It's not like I was overly ambitious..."" Baxter tells us defensively. ""You see, I have this little problem with my apartment I can't always get in when I want to."" The reason are several superiors, to whom he is lending his apartment for their extra-marital escapades. In exchange they promise to give his career a push by passing recommendations to the personnel manager, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Although Buddy Boy (that's his disrespectful yet firmly established nickname) is daily surrounded by hundreds of people, he is drowning in lonesomeness. Apart from his mocking colleagues, there does not seem to be any family or close friends. In fact, the only decent person among his acquaintances is his neighbour, Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), ironically under the wrong impression that the man next door is a womanizing drunkard. So Baxter meekly adapts to the mercilessness of corporate life, putting all hopes of happiness into his career. His free evenings consist of watching TV, preparing dinner or cleaning up after the occupants of his apartment. Yes, one could say that Baxter does not exactly lead a joyful life. Yet, there is something, or rather somebody carrying light into the loner's gloominess when he falls in love with the pretty elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Although Fran likes him for his decency and kindness, she does not quite share the feelings of her ardent admirer. But Buddy Boy refuses to notice any signs of unrequited love and eventually talks her into going out with him. You can imagine how Baxter feels when she fails to turn up, and how things get significantly worse when he finds out that she is actually having intimate meetings with the personnel manager Mr. Sheldrake in HIS apartment. The image of purity Baxter had of Fran is gone. On Christmas Eve, he decides to drown his broken heart in a bar while his apartment is occupied by the cause of his misery. But Fran doesn't feel any happier than Baxter, and with the depressing effect Christmas can have on the lonesome and desperate, the story threatens to take a turn into tragedy... It is hard to pin The Apartment on a single genre. The sharp, witty dialogue as well as Jack Lemmon's hilarious mimic would hint at a romantic comedy. Yet, one cannot overlook the tragic elements which let us dive into thoughtfulness, but never too deeply. Then again the film works on a satiric level, operating as cynical social commentary on corporate culture in the sixties (which is not very unlike today's business life). The remarkable thing about this film is that these three qualities merge perfectly into each other without ever losing the balance. The Apartment is a most entertaining picture, sometimes rushing from one hilarity to the next, and then suddenly slowing down to leave room for contemplation. Sometimes uplifting, sometimes depressing, sometimes both at the same time. Billy Wilder mixed these contrary moods, and most amazingly, it worked out just fine. First and foremost The Apartment deals with loneliness and the everlasting search for unaccomplished love. ""I used to live like Robinson Crusoe. I mean shipwrecked among 8 million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were."" Baxter tells Ms Kubelik. Does any relationship ever work out the way one dreamed it would? Additionally the film points out how people let themselves be treated badly out of total lack of self-esteem. Standing up for oneself and saying the simple word ""no"" can sometimes be an art of its own. As an able filmmaker and scriptwriter (together with I. A. L. Diamond, ""Some like it Hot""), Billy Wilder once again produced a film classic of outstanding quality. I have yet to see another picture, equally consistent at providing such humorous and well-timed dialogues. The amount of memorable quotes is remarkable and the entire cast did a terrific job at delivering them. Moreover, Wilder chose to shoot in black and white widescreen, shining with beautiful cinematography, and thereby gave the film a very special melancholy mood. Maybe the greatest strength of The Apartment is its honesty. It doesn't lie to us by painting images of perfect love or of perfect people. Neither does it create scenarios of utter hopelessness. However, it shows us that although life can be unfair on default, everyone is responsible for oneself to work up the courage to achieve happiness. With the director's cynical, yet comic approach to life, the film takes itself serious and it doesn't. It lets us taste the bitter and the sweet, thereby lending itself a tone of reality. For that reason alone I don't feel cheated by The Apartment and its story never failed to cheer me up. Then again, I may be too much of a pessimistic optimist."
"Jack Lemmon is the man.The Apartment really surprised me. The Best Picture winner starts off right in the middle of the action, but yet the first hour seems long and overrun. Too much time seems spent in trying to develop the characters (and oh so many of them) and not enough time is spent on just seeing what will happen. Just when I was about to lose faith, the film picks it up like I have never seen before. The whole sub-plot of the four guys wanting to use Lemmon's apartment for their evening tyrsts is dropped and Wilder smartly concentrates on Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray and the film creates true magic.The Apartment is more of a drama than a comedy and balances the two elements perfectly. Just after one of the more dramatic moments of the film, we see Lemmon straining his pasta with a tennis racquet. The use of the doctor and his wife in supporting roles are completely there for comedy and yet add so much to the film. The ending also rates up there with the best of all time using an old device that doesn't seem at all cliched in this film. Some say that ""Some like it hot"" was Wilder's best, but now I have to disagree. The Apartment is better and surely would have made my top ten had the first hour not been so predictable.How Jack Lemmon didn't win Best Actor is beyond me. His is a great performance, getting to act on more than one scale. MacMurray, another Wilder favourite is perfectly cast in the role of a family-wrecker. I wish they would have put a scene in which his wife confronts him with ""The News"". MacLaine glows on the screen even when she is sick and in bed.I fully recommend this film to all, it being Wilder's best makes it a must see.8/10 stars."
"Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"" is a film which can produce some of the biggest laughs and at the same time... can bring many viewers to tears, Billy Wilder's quaint little tale about everyday people who get tangled up in love, jealousy and infidelity boasts a top-notch cast led by the trio of Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray who are tremendous. The plot revolves around C.C. (Lemmon) who unknowingly makes the unethical attempt of climbing the corporate ladder by 'loaning' his apartment to members from his management chain to entertain their 'women on the side'. Given the change of circumstances, this premise certainly could even hit home in the current office environment. Although the office party and secretarial gossip scenes could be viewed as dated, the power and attitude of the corporate executive, Mr. Sheldrake (MacMurray) is certainly symbolic. The character of Fran (MacLaine) for today's standards of course seems too submissive and vulnerable but the reward of her finding true, admirable, unconditional companionship is quite enriching and fulfilling to any who see this memorable film."
"For me Billy Wilder has always been one of my all time favourite directors and he has not made a single film that has not appealed to me. Billy Wilder sums up perfection all his films manage to succeed in what they set out to do. Billy Wilder is not just one of the greatest directors; he is also one of the finest scriptwriters ever. Creating flowing dialogue like no other and perfectly making his actors and actresses work with the script brilliantly. Billy Wilder has made dark noirs, hilarious musicals and studies of human nature. It is extremely difficult to fully describe a director as versatile and genius as Billy Wilder. His films have held up for generations and will continue to have the same mass appeal that his films have had since their opening days.On the surface The Apartment might seem like a comedy and yes that's what it is on the surface. Once you start watching The Apartment you realise that actually it is a very dark film underneath and actually has characters that contemplate suicide. The fact is that The Apartment captures the realism of the everyday workman and makes you laugh as well as feel pity. The script is what keeps the film moving and shows how the characters in The Apartment change as the film progresses. The Apartment is about becoming somebody rather than being something that someone uses.Jack Lemmon creates C.C. Baxter the young aspiring workman who just wants to have a good career and the perfect woman. Though something always goes wrong and he's perfectly able to get a woman, but not the one he wants. At times you pity C.C. Baxter because he's so kind to everyone and never gets the thing he wants in return because something will always get in the way. I think there are times in every man's life where you probably feel like C.C. Baxter in one way or another.Jack Lemmon perfectly progresses with his character to make himself one of the most distinguishable character actors ever. Jack Lemmon works with an elegant skill at comedic performances and always captures the true essence of his characters. He seems to be one of those actors who are able to find the perfect chemistry with his fellow cast. What makes C.C. Baxter so brilliant is the fact he stands for everything the film is about. He becomes one of the mot uplifting and joyous ever put on screen. Shirley MacLaine is also excellent as the lovable Fran Kubelik (C.C. Baxter's heartthrob). From first impressions you'd think she is a beautiful and happy women, but she's actually very different to what you might expect.The script is fast paced, memorable and most of all it helps sum up all the characters so well. It's a script that works so easily with its actors and helps to make some of the most superb character situations. The script is realistic as well and actually does feel like the kind of talk that would be used in similar situations in life. The script is extremely natural and the subtle undertones prove Billy Wilder's crafting of intellectual film-making.The film is actually very similar to that of its A Wonderful Life and you could say Jack Lemmon is very similar to that of James Stewart. The direction is simple and fulfilling. It captures the image of ""the apartment"" perfectly and though just like any other New York apartment it feels extremely likable and memorable. The film's use of music is another high point and feels perfectly hand picked for the scenes it's used in. The film is actually quite sexually vibrant and does have many sexual undertones in its dialogue. Though subtle, it definitely is there and perfectly helps add more subtext to the film as a whole. A film to be studied in depth and not just watched.A film that never gets old and always manages to make the viewer feel uplifted with happiness. A first class example of perfected film-making you're ever going to see. Yes it's a definitive must-see, a masterpiece that was way ahead of its time and much more than just a movie."
"A struggling office worker in a giant insurance company lends his apartment to higher ups in order to get a promotion. Set during the Holidays, the theme of infidelity turned a lot of viewers off. The Holiday setting however is what provides a lot of the film's best scenes, as in the fantastic office Christmas party where the secretaries are doing a CanCan on the table and couples are making out in the corner. The one-two punch of Jack Lemmon's classic performance and that of Fred MacMurray is fabulous, and the triangle of sorts that forms with Shirley McClaine makes this much more than the comedy that it is known for."
"Billy Wilder's The Apartment was one of a huge list of movies that are considered classics which I haven't seen, and indeed knew very little about (other than the level of admiration which many people have for it). Having a vague knowledge of the stars of the film (Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine), for one reason or another I was expecting a light-hearted comedy filled with innuendo and witty banter, a tradition of filmmaking that was common around the period when this film was released. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed, as these elements are all in play in The Apartment, but what really thrilled and surprised me was the much more serious subject matter that the film deals with. To say this is simply a comedy is completely false, as it's a somewhat dark and daring study of the nature of love and infidelity, and the stunning performances and filmmaking on display had me enthralled from the first frame.The film certainly begins as a comedy. C.C. Baxter (Lemmon) is a young bachelor trying to ascend the corporate ladder by allowing a group of his superiors to use his apartment for their extra-marital liaisons. After he falls for charismatic elevator attendant Fran (MacLaine), who is engaged in an illicit relationship with Mr. Sheldrake, the married head of the company, Baxter tries to free himself from the demands of his bosses, with hilarious results. While this is certainly risqué subject matter (for 1960), the film takes an unexpectedly sombre turn when Fran makes a suicide attempt in the apartment after learning the truth behind Sheldrake's motives. What follows is a touching, and at times heart-wrenching flowering of Baxter and Fran's relationship, and if the ending is a little predictable, the journey getting there is really something wonderful.The Apartment features an excellent selection of fully-formed support characters, but the film really belongs to Lemmon and MacLaine. Lemmon's reputation as cinema's greatest everyman is really on show here, and it's impossible not to root for him and sympathise with his plight. Playing Baxter as a charming yet awkward underdog, his character is the embodiment of the 'nice guys finish last' maxim, and although some elements of his life may be a little shady to say the least, Lemmon is flawless. MacLaine is completely up to Lemmon's high standard as Fran, effortlessly making audiences fall in love with her just as Baxter has. She's just so damn cute that even when she's recovering from an overdose of sleeping pills, she exudes such a potent 'girl next door' allure that can't be avoided. Her chemistry with Lemmon is palpable, and when they inevitably end up together, it's one of those truly satisfying romantic moments seen all too rarely in modern cinema.I'm not usually one to get nostalgic when it comes to film periods, but while I do have great fondness for many more recent romantic comedies, Hollywood really doesn't make movies like The Apartment any more. Wilder's screenplay (co-written with I.A.L. Diamond) is clever, witty and engaging, particularly in the subtle motifs and unique idiosyncrasies of all the characters, and the film is just so expertly crafted. I'm determined now to seek out more Wilder films, along with catching up on my Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. I can't recommend The Apartment highly enough!"
"This film was groundbreaking in the sense that it dealt with sexual harassment in the workplace in a way that was quite realistic for 1960. All the women are in menial jobs at the insurance company where Jack Lemmon's character works, and all of the executives are men. The executives look at their female workforce as one big harem and won't let a little thing like the fact that they are married and intend to stay that way interfere with their stepping out from time to time. This is where C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) comes in. He trades the use of his apartment to these executives in return for promotions and perks. However, Baxter has an attack of conscience when he comes face-to-face with the collateral damage that one of these executives is doing in the person of Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Fran, the elevator operator, has just found out she is one of many affairs for big boss Mr. Sheldrake (Fred McMurray), whom she genuinely loves, and when she and Sheldrake quarrel in Baxter's apartment and Sheldrake leaves her some money for her troubles, unintentionally making her feel even cheaper than she already feels she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills hoping not to wake up, slipping into a coma on Baxter's bed.Things I noticed - this film has lost something with the passage of time in the shock value that was, I think, part of the original appeal. But it still has some outstanding acting, some personal redemption and transformation that people just love to see on film, and kudos to Mr. McMurray for portraying an authentic heel, leading women on and leading a double life without a tinge of conscience, phoning to inquire about his mistress' health on Christmas Day as he is busy playing with his children at home. Without this entry under his belt I would have always doubted his range as he was the perennial nice guy in almost every other role he ever had.Did you also notice a business world and a New York that is gone forever? Nobody adds numbers by hand - or by computer for that matter - any more, elevators have long been run by machines, and the entire floor of people that Baxter worked on would today be replaced by computers. Also notice that Baxter has a very middling job - at least at first - and yet lives comfortably sans roommate to share expenses in an apartment IN Manhattan. Those were the days."
"Billy Wilder has made some tremendous satires. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is one of the greatest satires on film. ""The Apartment"", though not as cynical, is a very good one as well. I like that the satire is a backdrop for the main love story, and yet an integral part of it. The film shows just how much people are will to prostitute themselves in order to get what they want, whether that be a family or an executive office. Wilder handles some very serious and bawdy themes with a precise touch. This film could have easily turned into a wacky comedy of errors, but he is much to talented and sympathetic for that. He gives Baxter's character some sincere emotional depth. I could almost feel his loneliness and longing in many scenes. He is never really sure what he wants and how he can get it. He is a man searching for something, and he doesn't quite know it. Lemon plays this role to perfection. He doesn't go overboard. He gives the character the right amount of silliness and charm. McClaine is very strong. Her character is not stereotyped. She is a wounded soul that is looking for respite in the absolutely wrong place. I found her very charming and lovable. Some much of the film is in the wonderful cinematography. Wilder uses the widescreen to its fullest capability. The framing is so precise. You get a feeling of utter separation and distance. I really like the nearly infinite succession of desks in the office."
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Anyone that knows about comedy knows about ""Some Like It Hot"", and anyone that know about ""Some Like It Hot"" knows about Billy Wilder. This was his next film, and the reason I mention that is that this is a serious and melancholy drama with the form and rhythm of comedy. But it's not a funny movie, and part of the genius of the writing and direction is that Lemmon's character especially only figures this out in the third act.Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an unmarried drone amongst drones in a huge insurance company, possessing of two important things: a bachelor's apartment near Central Park (check out his rent!!), and an amoral willingness to allow company higher-ups to use his place for after-hours trysts with their girlfriends and pickups they meet in bars. To C.C., the problems associated with operating a safe-house for affairs are merely logistical, not moral; in one scene, he is seen rearranging his and everyone's schedule to accomodate Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) a real bigwig, with the expertise and interest of an air traffic controller.His hope is to promote himself within the company by pleasing his superiors, and for awhile that seems to be working. It turns out, however, that Sheldrake's current flame is Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who C.C. has quite the crush on; in fact, she stands him up on their first date to meet Sheldrake at their favorite Chinese restaurant, where Sheldrake asks her to resume their affair, intimating that he will leave his wife for her (a lie that no-one except her even pretends to believe).Without going into too many details, the joy of and intelligence this is how well this triangle works itself out slowly and with some pain by all concerned. Although C.C. really likes Fran, she won't give him the time of day, first because she's already bruised and involved with Sheldrake, and, later, because she sees his flaws better than he does (and, possibly, we do). At one point they agree that it's too bad that she doesn't fall for a guy like him, but the exchange is given additional bittersweetness not only by her inability to fall for a ""nice guy"" but her awareness that, as he is at that point, he's not really such a nice guy. One of the beauties of this script is that it takes awhile for us to notice that C.C. is just as bad as Sheldrake is; he's totally okay with the infidelities he is assisting in as long as he gets his promotion out of it, and it isn't his business whether anyone (wives or girlfriends) gets hurt in the process. Even the resounding disapproval from his next door neighbors (who just think he's a very busy playboy from what they can hear night after night coming through the walls) doesn't get him to think. Yet Lemmon plays the role with total innocence; he thinks he's in a comedy and it takes a real life-threatening problem halfway through to get him to start considering the error of his ways. Even then, he's still just trying to work the situation, without taking any stand himself. (There are only about two actors I know of that could pull this role off: Jack Lemmon and Tom Hanks, both of whom have such audience appeal that they can be this spineless without the audience despising them.) Interestingly, for all her personality, intelligence and self-awareness, Fran isn't much better; she's no stranger to the hazards of having affairs with married men, yet has little qualms about resuming her affair with Sheldrake. Both C.C. and Fran really are willing to sacrifice their integrity for something they hope to get from Sheldrake - him, the high-floor, corner window office, her, the gold wedding ring.I've stressed that this is a drama in comedy form to emphasize that this screen play is one of the most intelligently written I have ever seen; it takes a non-story (or at least, obviously bedroom-farcical material) and inhabits it with character interaction and development of the most subtle and human kind. You expect lots of bedroom-closet-under-the couch people shuffling (like in The Pink Panther of three years later) and general hilarity, perhaps ending up with someone partially disrobed and dangling from a window; instead you find out that each of these characters has a little history of his own. I rented this the other night, thinking that it would indeed be a comedy, and about halfway through found myself thinking ""This is REALLY good!"".  I've been renting lots of pre-1975 movies (The Sting, Spartacus, this one) in an unprecedented attack of escapist nostalgia, and have been rewarded with jewels like this. Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, this is one of the best pictures I've seen this or any year. It's a cliche to say that Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore, yet the nearest thing to this is My Best Friend's Wedding?(A couple of notes I really liked: Ray Walston's character is perfectly cast and played, as usual; the whole picture is a cynical Valentine to New York and the 50's at the same time; and anyone who saw this at the time could see that Shirley MacLaine was gonna be a big star)."
"My local cinema does ""Secret Movie Night"" once a month, you just show up and watch a ""classic"" of their choosing, you just don't know what it is until it starts.One of the reasons that I enjoy this is that I end up viewing films that I might not, otherwise, choose to watch. Case in point is the selection for May - the 1960 Oscar winner for Best Picture, THE APARTMENT - a ""love story"" with some comedy and some dark dramatic moments and themes. A very tricky combination of items that are bundled together, brilliantly, by a master of the craft.THE APARTMENT tells the story of nebbish office worker C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon in an Oscar nominated performance, more on that later) who is talked into lending his apartment to higher-ups in his company so they can carry out extra-marital affairs. When one of the affairs goes wrong, Baxter is forced to ""clean up the mess"".Written and Directed by the GREAT Billy WIlder (SOME LIKE IT HOT, SUNSET BOULEVARD), The Apartment is more than a love story, more than a look into the vacuous lives of those anonymous office workers, it is a look into the lives of those who are victims of abuse of power. Wilder, rightfully so, won the Oscar for Best Director and Best Screenplay for this film. The Apartment is strongly written and directed not flinching at the deep subject matter while also balancing things out with moments of comedy and joy, turning what could have been a dour, dark subject into a more joyous exploration of true humanity and love rising through the corruption and abuse of power heaped upon them.In the lead role of CC Baxter, Lemmon is perfectly cast. Starting as a pure comedic character who is set upon by a world too strong for him, his character slowly turns sharper, deeper, more serious and more real as the film progresses. Lemmon was nominated for the Oscar for his performance - and rightfully so. I had to look up who beat him out for the statue and found out it was Burt Lancaster's powerhouse performance in ELMER GANTRY, so I can't really argue about this (but I digress).Matching Lemmon beat for beat is Shirley MacLaine, the wronged girl who's ""issues"" (I'm not going to spoil what happens, if you haven't seen this) are at the heart of this film - and at the heart of Lemmon's character. MacLaine is charming and tragic in this role and she, too, was nominated for an Oscar (for Best Actress losing to Elizabeth Taylor for Butterfield 8). Rounding out the cast was a pre-MY 3 SONS Fred MacMurray (as the Exec who abuses both Lemmon's and MacLaine's characters). He was terrific as this cad, and thought for sure that he would have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but that honor went to Jack Kruschen as Lemmon's neighbor in the apartment building where they both lived. I am fine with that but preferred MacMurray's performance. Also showing up are such great character actors as Ray Walston (MY FAVORITE MARTIAN), David Lewis (GENERAL HOSPITAL), Willard Waterman (THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE) and David White (Larry Tate in BEWITCHED) as other Execs using The Apartment for their purposes.This is a terrific motion picture and if you haven't seen it (or if you haven't seen it in quite sometime), I highly recommend you check it out (it is shown on the Turner Classic Movie channel on a fairly regular basis). It certainly shows a slice of life during the MAD MEN days that just doesn't exist anymore - and also presents a type of film, and a type of filmmaker, that just doesn't exist today.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"Baxter, an office worker, makes his apartment available to philandering executives at his office in order to move up the corporate ladder. Things become complicated when his boss takes an elevator girl Baxter has taken a shine to back to his pad.In this Billy Wilder film, Jack Lemmon is on hand with another effective comic performance. He seemed to be good at playing under-dog characters .We root for him here even though we know he is a bit of a weasel that bends over backwards for unlikable bosses. It's testament to Lemmon's charisma that we are never in doubt that he is a sympathetic character. He is more than matched by Shirley Maclaine here as the elevator girl, though. She was an elfin beauty and it's very easy to understand Baxter's infatuation with her. She is probably the best thing in this film to be honest. Her character undergoes the most extreme story arc, where she veers from comic scenes to an attempted suicide. It's because of this especially that The Apartment is a light film that has some pretty dark undercurrents. The central plot-line was pretty racy stuff for its time as well, with the apartment of the title being a den of iniquity and vice. But on the whole it's pretty light-hearted despite this. But it's often when it gets darker that it gets more interesting, the whole post-suicide attempt sequence was probably the best part of the film. The drama often outweighs the comedy in this one. While it is a romantic comedy, it's not really full of laughs and the plot-line is more melancholic a lot of the time. It also displays a definite cynicism towards the practices of big business in their carefree immorality and misogyny. It's probably a little overlong in fairness and some of the side characters and comedy don't add too much. But overall it's good enough, if perhaps a little over-rated."
"The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a ""classic"". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. Jack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company's office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. The movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny."
"The Apartment is a pretty sweet film. I bought this on impulse purchase, after reading it was Vincent Gallo's favourite film.To make it short  Insurance Clerk, Bud Baxter gets tied up in loaning out his modest NY apartment to sleazy Insurance executives, in return for favours that will boost his career. Seems simple, but the plot draws you in, playing around a theme of doing the right thing for the big company boss, and at the same time stripping Bud's chances with his unrequited love  Miss Kubelik (MacClaine). The whole thing ties up well and always leaves you rooting for Baxter's plight.The Apartment is a great romance of its time, neatly directed, great dialogue and excellently delivered by a strong cast.Shirley Maclaine does well to conjure that ""something"", us men find crazy about the girl-next-door types. Jack Lemmon is quite excellent too, in a manner that resembles a latter day Jim Carrey. He's a bit geeky, sometimes overly enthusiastic and has no coolness about him, only to be redeemed by his eventual purity.~Paul Browne."
"I would first like to make the comment that this is no comedy. For those that consider this film a valuable part of Hollywood cinema due to the comedic aspects need to get their eyes examined along with their minds. I do not think that I laughed at all during this film, but I would like to mention that I do not think that is a bad thing. Not laughing at this film means that it hit you at a different level. I witnessed a beautiful film with some highly intelligent actors painting a dark and disturbing picture of a sexual world circa 1960. I suppose I was thinking that this was going to be a ""screwball"" comedy, which completely threw me off balance when the events of this film occurred. Never have I witnessed such a bold attack on the sexual revolution of the 60s and its effect on the business world. It was a slap in the face to see the way that Billy Wilder represented corporate America and honestly, it felt really good. To see this lonely man turned away from his apartment at all hours of the night because his boss needed a place to take their mistresses was sad, not funny, yet in The Apartment it worked beautifully.To begin, this film revolved around the actors. If you would not have had such strong actors like Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray honestly conquering their roles than this film would not have succeeded as it did. It won Oscars for a reason, and even watched by today's standard of Hollywood I think that everyone involved should be very proud. Their work was the best Hollywood had to offer. Lemmon successfully portrayed this hurt every-man that you could easily find yourself engulfed within. MacLaine, beautiful in her young age, was an emotional powerhouse. Her eyes could have told the story without any words. You could feel her emotions through her eyes, and it was outstanding. I must say that my favorite actor in this entire film was Fred MacMurray. His portrayal of the typical ""boss"" who seems to use his powers to control instead of help, was perfect. In fact, even if you watch the film today, you may still be able to see your boss in MacMurray's portrayal. For once, it was a solid cast. It had a structured story that was heightened by sublime actors that knew exactly what they needed to do. I would have to say that this is one of the greatest pairings in cinema history, these three together could have taken Hollywood by storm, and it is evident in The Apartment.As I stated before, the characters are exceptional, but coupled with their performances is a rich story that seems developed well before its time. I was not expecting to see such a sexual driven film released from the 60s. Films of this nature typically hint towards sex, but never quite spell it out, but in The Apartment it is in your face throughout the course of the film. From the opening sequence until the end, sex seems to be the biggest underlying theme of this film. In the world of C.C. Baxter, all he seems to know is sex, business, and the occasional conversation with the elevator girl. You can't help but wonder if that wasn't what was going through the minds of our fathers as they headed to the corporate world on a daily basis. It was such a slap to the face of the day to day America. To think that in this nation portrayed with family values and moral uprising that The Apartment would emerge as the breakout film of 1960. It shocked me. I think the reason that it did so was because of the strong writing, the powerful story, and the emergence of such innocent ""characters"" (as mentioned above). There were moments during this film that I honestly wanted to walk into the television, tell everyone to stop, and explain what was happening because I didn't want anyone to get hurt in the end. Isn't that a sign of a long-lasting powerful film? To me it is.Overall, I must say that The Apartment left my jaw on the floor. While my wife will disagree with me, I thought that it was a brilliant moment in cinematic history. Jack Lemmon could not have been handed a greater roll, nor could he have pulled it off with such beauty and pizazz. The story will shock and amaze you for nearly two hours. We are taken into a world in which we feel comfortable in, we feel as if we have been there before, and we can only thank the imaginative mind of Billy Wilder for that. He takes those moments in our lives that we wholeheartedly want to forget and places them in the window for all to see. His mockery of corporations, of the small man working his way to the top, and the disasters that follow are nothing short of classic. I have never witnessed a film quite like this and I hope I never do again. The Apartment was a once in a lifetime enjoyment, and I cannot wait to revisit it soon to see what I may have missed! Grade: ***** out of *****"
"Diamond-sharp satire with great cast gives powerful performances, dealing with a lowly insurance clerk called C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) who attempts to climb the corporate ladder by loaning his apartment out to executives having affairs , only to outsmart himself when the girl of his dreams is brought there by his chief (Fred MacMurray) . Things go wrong , however , when he unwittlingly falls in love for sweet elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) , the most recent love interest of his unfeeling chief Sheldrake . Problems arise , when Lemmon saves MacLaine from a suicide attempt .A splendid film with magnificent and amusing script by the compelling tandem LAL Diamond and Bily Wilder about a fast-talking clerk : Jack Lemmon , an elevator operator : Shirley MacLaine and the scheming philander chief executive : Fred MacMurray . Rightly enjoyable with plenty of sly bits of business and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations , a feeling romance and bitterness . Giving a jaundiced vision leavened by a tender sympathy for the frailty of human motives . Adding the enjoyable finale , it is rather stirring , given the delicate skill with which Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine blend pathos and comedy . Very good performance from Jack Lemmon as a botcher Clerk who forges ahead in the rat race by lending his apartment out to philandering senior executives . Phenomenal playing from everyone , including a top-notch secondary cast , such as Ray Walston , Jack Kruschen , David Lewis , Hope Holiday , Joyce Jameson , David White , Edie Adams and many others .
The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Excellent direction render this stunning story more funny than usual . One of Wilder's most inventive and furious screen adaptations . It achieved 5 Academy Awards , including best film and closed up several other nominations : acting awards for Jack Lemmon and MacLaine and Jack Kruschen as Baxter's doctor neighbour . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team , Wilder-Diamond , had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨The Apartment¨ rating : 7.5/10 . Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same ."
"Billy Wilder is one of those film-makers who tackled so many genres throughout his career. ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"", one of his earliest productions, saw him take on film-noir and drama; with ""Stalag 17"" he showed that he could make films about war too; and with ""Some Like it Hot"" he made one of the best-loved comedies of its time. So where does ""The Apartment"" fall in all of this? Well it's a credit to the director, in that he merges genres so skilfully. He brings both comedic and dramatic elements together throughout, and it's all so incredibly watchable.The film follows ""Buddy Boy"" Baxter (Jack Lemmon), a worker in a dull office building, who allows his superiors to borrow his apartment in order to have affairs in secret. This action gets him promoted to much more senior positions, due to good favour, and his neighbours are none the wiser, assuming that he comes home each night with a different woman. He soon falls in love with Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also caught up in an affair with Baxter's boss, played by Fred MacMurray. The love-triangle is a classic comedy device, and is pulled off here so well, as Wilder adds drama to it as well as comedy.Jack Lemmon shines throughout the film, giving a comedic performance at the height of ""Some Like it Hot"". He is a remarkable actor, and can make even the smallest things be charming and humorous, through the use of intonation or facial expressions. MacLaine is also brilliant, and portrays Kubelik as lovely but depressed. A scene where Fran tries to overdose on sleeping pills should break the flow of a comedy by adding a very serious element of drama in, but thanks to the duo's performances, it never feels too solemn. Their shared charm, with Baxter trying to cheer her up with card games, is what makes the movie work so well. The ending which the two share together is simple yet beautiful.Even though the film isn't at all shocking today, in its time the concept of adultery was one which was not widely portrayed in mainstream cinema, and Wilder's script is a firm satire on adultery throughout. It's visually fairly ordinary, but the clutter of Baxter's apartment and business of the office are things which help to add to its appeal. In all, it's a simply charming film which hits home on some important dramatic points, while never straying far from its initial comedic intentions."
"When it comes to movies people love to make lists of the best this and best that. You've probably seen The Apartment on plenty of best comedies lists. Which begs the question who ever decided this was a comedy? The Apartment isn't a bad movie but it's not a funny one. To even call it a comedy-drama would be a stretch as the comedy to drama ratio skews far, far away from the comedic side of things. There are no big laughs here. There are barely even any mild chuckles. Which again is not to say this is a bad movie. It's just that if all you know about The Apartment is that you've seen it on best comedies lists you are in for quite a surprise when you actually watch it. If you're in the mood for some lighthearted comedic amusement you have definitely come to the wrong film.Our story follows office drone C.C. Baxter whose means of getting ahead in life is to loan out his apartment to higher-ups at his company for their extramarital trysts. The big boss, Mr. Sheldrake, gets wind of the arrangement and he wants in on the deal. Baxter gets a big promotion, Sheldrake gets a place to carry on with his latest in a string of office mistresses. Only this mistress, probably like all before her, is convinced that Sheldrake is going to divorce his wife to be with her. Fat chance. When she discovers the truth this supposed comedy, which really hasn't been funny at all to this point, takes a darker turn. At this point any hopes a viewer might have had for fun and laughs from one of the ""best comedies ever"" disappear.And what of C.C. Baxter? He has his own connection with Sheldrake's mistress. Well, at least he'd like to. He's got a kind of hopeless schoolboy crush on her and when he discovers she's Sheldrake's girl his illusions are shattered. What's worse is that he knows Sheldrake's just using the girl but he dare not say anything. A guy's got to look out for his career you know? Eventually when, in a rather dire way, circumstances change Baxter may have to take a stand. Here at least the film picks up a bit of drama. Still looking for the comedy though.Your enjoyment of The Apartment will likely be related to your expectations. If what you're expecting is a great comedy you're going to be disappointed. But if you know going in what it is you're getting yourself into there is much to appreciate. The best thing the film has to offer is the performance of Jack Lemmon as Baxter. It's a great portrayal of a hapless office schnook constantly being taken advantage of. People walk all over Baxter and you can't help but feel for the guy. Lemmon gives the character great heart. And whatever little moments of comedy there are come from him. He's a performer who knows how to draw out a smile from the viewer. Fred MacMurray as Sheldrake and Shirley MacLaine as the girl in the middle of it all are also quite good. Not as memorable as Lemmon perhaps but no quibbles with their performances. The quibbles come with the story itself and with the film's billing as a comedy. Initially the film looks like it's setting itself up for some funny, if tawdry, bed-hopping shenanigans. But the laughs never really come. And the story ultimately veers down some surprisingly dark paths. How this is considered a great comedy I'll never quite understand. Not a bad movie though for what it is."
"With thematic content that is still relevant today anywhere from NYC to Tokyo, the heart of this very real human dramedy is that quiet, simple love endures and triumphs in the end, and that there is hope for the millions of people feeling trapped and lonely in what seems to be otherwise insignificant lives. The Apartment is a beautiful and endearing film that shows its audiences the greater meaning behind the vanities of life. How love, modest elegance and principles in character ultimately overrule self centredness, indulgence, and materialistic corporate ladder decadence. In fact, regardless of the corporate settings for the main character, the essential element of the rat race that everyone plays today, as well as the content delving into extramarital adulterous liaisons, considered taboo during its time, is what ensures the film its very timeless quality, and its relevance to the modern world till today. It is these qualities that have caused the film to earn labels like, being 'ahead of its time' or a 'classic'. And what a classic it is.Billy Wilder, the writing talent behind such brilliant works as ""Ninotchka"", makes this film his second outing after the highly celebrated ""Some Like it Hot"". Many felt he might be hard pressed to top that, but in a totally different direction thematically, does so with this film. The story is much more about the dramatic pinpricks of human tragedy and loneliness insofar as it is laced with comedic turns about a man who loans his apartment out to bosses for their extramarital liaisons in order to gain their approval and climb the ladder at work. But complications ensue when he discovers a beautiful woman he desires to court is actually inimically one of the objects exploited beguilingly by his very boss in his very apartment, forcing him into an impugning quagmire. Wilder blends these elements in perfect harmony in this film, with the chemistry between the cast of the wry humoured Jack Lemmon and the cloy beauty of Shirley MacLaine (Wilder would pair them again for Irma Douce) neatly balanced with the pure wit and pacing of the script, whilst always undergirding the whole film with a sense of a genuine sanctity for compassion for the whole plot. Far from considering the film an insult on the many who play sycophantic roles on the way up the rat race or corporate ladder, or the adulterous men, the cynicism can be construed with much verecund indignation as it highlights the sadness of it all without being condescending. In fact, the characters speak of the struggle each City dweller in modern living can identify with. There is no condescending need to present anyone as perfect, overtly altruistic, overtly feminine nor elegant (MacLaine's character is a lift attendant) nor flawless in their life choices. They make mistakes, sweat over them, and regret. A real rarity for films emerging out of Hollywood on the back of the 1950s with swashbuckling heroines and heroes. Lemmon's character is a simple bachelor with an air of inevitable loneliness in the meanderings of life in a NY apartment. That's why they call them a-part-ments. You live apart. And alone. He is an amalgam of a laid back yet pre-emptively self serving corporate machine, who ostensibly is forced into playing the only role he knows in order to better his predicament of being merely yet another average diploma staffer on Wall St- to climb up the corporate-ladder in his General insurance firm. The real beauty here in Wilder's script is that Lemmon, and also Maclaine (who makes the wrong choices by being mistress to Lemmon's boss), is that both characters harness a true propensity for love and care that is nestled within, waiting to exhale whilst in the midst of them being stuck in their cyclical ruts of despair. The real satisfaction comes when both these characters reconcile each others pains, heal each other (literally too in the classic doctor scene) and find love amid the hustle bustle of the rat race in the world that goes on around them, championing each other on. They play gin rummy in the final scene, in heart wrenchingly beautiful emotional overtones, kept painfully modest by Wilder, and celebrating the simple love that triumphs over all hurts. The themes are relevant till today, and the quality of what this film achieved stylistically (as the last of the B&W generation) remains extant in full living colour today, because of the sheer timeless message of hope this film carries to anyone who's ever been that insignificant other, or ordinary person to be forgotten in that apartment out there.For that alone, it deserves an 8/10.By Stephen Thanabalan"
"In an age of cinema thriving on relatively simple black and white tales of right and wrong, director Billy Wilder had always stood out as daring to recognize the ambiguity in characters and situations, making his films more difficult to classify than those of his contemporaries. And while Wilder's follow up to the tremendously successful Some Like It Hot may be visually black and white (the last best picture winner in over thirty years made without colour) its classification is far more elusive than such simplistic terms. Part corporate satire, part character study, part societal critique, part comedy, part tragedy, all melding together for a superbly emotionally affecting effort , The Apartment proves to be one of Wilder's finest works in a career inundated with tremendous successes. Contrary to its reputation as one of the funniest films of its era, and its jovial sounding plot of a businessman (Lemmon) attempting to rise in the office by lending his apartment to superiors having extramarital trysts, The Apartment is no light watch, coming across as surprisingly dark and morose even when viewed in a contemporary context, let alone for its time. Tackling such heavy themes as suicide and existentialism in a surprisingly straightforward fashion for its time, Wilder works in some stellar instances of expressionist lighting to add to the frequently melancholy mood, as the viewer's heart leaps out to the genuinely sympathetic characters. But this heartbreaking drama only makes the perfectly honed laughs all the more necessary and effective, with Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's brilliant one-liners cutting through the tragic overtones with snappy wit and bristling punch (Wilder even gets a sly dig in at reportedly difficult former star Marilyn Monroe, and the closing line ""Shut up and deal"" has become a classic, paralleling its predecessor in Some Like it Hot). Far from being a simple comedy or drama, The Apartment blends the two seamlessly, in a bold emotional balancing act, truly showcasing the saving power of laughter. While in the midst of balancing the tragic and the comic, the film may occasionally lose its emotional poignancy, such is a small complaint in such a phenomenally impressive work. Jack Lemmon is pitch perfect for the role of constantly downtrodden but tenaciously upbeat everyman C.C. Baxter - his tremendously endearing charisma captures the viewer's heart as he chuckles through countless struggles, a cheery testament to perseverance through hard times. Shirley MacLaine gives a powerful and moving performance as Fran Kubelik, a woman struggling to make good in a one sided relationship, act outside the confines of her gender and make sense of the increasingly bleak world around her. MacLaine's offbeat charm makes her a perfectly sympathetic and endearing foil to Lemmon, with whom she shares superb chemistry. Fred MacMurray, playing savagely against type, is a scream as shamelessly self-serving corporate boss Sheldrake. MacMurray's snappy timing is put to uncommonly caustic, but just as effective use, stealing most of the scenes he appears in. Jack Kruschen and Naomi Stevens similarly raise many a laugh as Baxter's distrustful neighbours. Alternating between staggeringly funny and heart-wrenchingly downbeat, Wilder's masterful achievement easily justifies the countless accolades bestowed upon it. With a sharp script surprisingly daring for its time, and an enormously charismatic lead trio of actors, The Apartment makes its mark as easily one of the most moving, sporadically comical, and ultimately human films of its time.-9/10"
"I've admired The Apartment for a long time, and watching it again last night reinforced all the good feelings. Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray all give wonderful performances, full of nuance and grace. Billy Wilder's direction flows effortlessly between sharp satire (e.g. the treatment of the four philandering managers) and touching human drama (e.g. the doctor repeatedly slapping Shirley MacLaine to bring her back from an overdose of sleeping pills). The writing is great.(It's interesting to watch The Apartment as a period piece. You have to factor out Billy Wilder's satirical exaggerations - the long rows of anonymous workers at their desks, etc - but you can still see things about working life in the 50's that would make us shudder today. For example, when Jack Lemmon admits that he looked up Shirley MacLaine's insurance information, there is only a tiniest hint of disapproval from her, instead of the outrage we would expect somebody to feel today at such a blatant invasion of privacy.)"
"Of course you have, so I don't have to spend many words on it. The question is: do antidotes exist? Please watch Fran rushing to C.C. (I still can hear the music, can you?) and if you don't agree, please write me and I'll pay your ticket back.Once Billy Wilder said that if a director managed to keep for two hours people far away from their troubles, he had done his task. Today I read that he left us. 'Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince: And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!'10/10 to this movie and to B.W."
"The Apartment starts off in a very catchy way by an original, dynamic, finely directed plot that arouses curiosity and impatience as to the following developments.Unfortunately, the movie turns, after an hour, into a behind closed doors love story, where the rhythm drops significantly simultaneously with the interest for this conventional and schmaltzy romance. The film then struggles to find a second wind and this second part turns out to be very long, so much so that the viewer is almost relieved when it comes to an end.It's a bit of a shame because, besides the cast and direction both accurate, the script suggests a cynical critic of the unmerciful world of business, the race for profit and individual success, foreshadowing, relatively speaking, other works on the dehumanization of work such as Brazil — think of the shot of the lined up desks."
"C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is an employee in a huge corporation. To promote himself, he lends out his apartment to his superiors so they can have extramarital affairs. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), the mistress of his boss, JD Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).I first saw The Apartment when I was 17 years old. I instantly liked it, but it would never have occurred to me to label it ""my favourite film"". It isn't cinematic ally dazzling. It doesn't feature any of my favourite actors. It doesn't push the boundaries of what's acceptable in film. Yet over the next thirteen years, I kept getting drawn back to it- because I could see the parallels that it had with my own life. This is a story about priorities and the bittersweet nature of relationships that I found to be haunting. Not bad for a comedy.The best way to see this movie is a letterboxed DVD. It captures the intimacy of the characters better than the cinema experience and the loneliness of the spaces surrounding them better than a pan and scan version.Jack Lemmon was a theatrically trained actor who gave his all and took quite a few critical hits for it (and praise too; he won several acting prizes). The Apartment contains most of his finest work as Wilder keeps him under firm control. Lemmon finds the right tone and understands the material perfectly. In interviews, he remarked of the ending: ""Billy threw a rose into a garbage pail"". C.C. Baxter is an engaging character, although he can be a little overbearing at times. Lemmon is at his best in the quieter moments- that perfect stone face he projects as he says ""I said I had no family. I didn't say I had an empty apartment"". At times, he doesn't seem to be in control of his own body- witness him dancing around like somebody else is pulling the strings.Shirley MacLaine is wonderful as Fran. She stays totally focused on the person she's talking to and delivers her dialogue sharply. You get a real sense of loss when Fran attempts suicide, because you don't pity her. MacLaine is totally unsentimental here- it's more an attempt to get somebody's attention than self-annihilation.Fred MacMurray's best two film roles were for Wilder (this and Double Indemnity (1944)) and the director uses him for maximum effect. Probably the most sordid scene in the film is family Christmas scene as Sheldrake's son opens his presents and has just discovered the word ""profligate""- it's very subversive watching the all-American dad being a philanderer and a liar. MacMurray embodies everyday, uncaring, ordinary meanness here. You can see the charm and power that makes him attractive to women like Fran. You can also see the transparent snake-oil salesmanship that alienates him from people who know better and don't have to be nice to him.What I love about Billy Wilder's films (and this one in particular) is the fact that you don't have to make any allowances for him. More than any other director of his era, Wilder deals with the basic elements of humanity and these never date. Although The Apartment is a film very much of its time in its setting (Sheldrake getting his shoe shined by a black man) and references (a secretary complains that she can't rendezvous with her boss because The Untouchables is on TV that night), it seems more modern than ever. I can't think of another film that depicts life choices as realistically and as entertainingly as this one does. I've related to this film in so many ways. I've often been too eager to please and unsure whether people like me or what I do for them. I've had a crush on a co-worker who didn't return my affections. I'm often helping out damaged women. I think the movie captures the bittersweet nature of life perfectly.I revisit The Apartment once a year. Watching it is like revisiting an old friend who sets you straight. This isn't a film for everyone (despite winning a Best Picture Oscar)- it often leaves a sour aftertaste to people who may find some elements objectionable. Yet it fits in with my jaundiced but romantically hopeful view of life and that's why it's my favourite movie."
"This film dances curiously on the line between depressing/lack of morality and a classically satirical comedy. The staging and dialogue are razor sharp and precise and keep the action moving and the emotions being conveyed crystal clear and tangible, even if the words being said conflict with the truth. The apparent lack of ethics in protagonist C.C. Baxter's actions, when he lends his apartment to his bosses and eventually his direct superior, Sheldrake, for their romantic rendezvous, make the romantic interest in the elevator operator, Miss Kubelik, seem wholesome by comparison. While at many points it seems things will careen off of the tracks and spiral badly, the comedic nature of the film always swoops in a saves the plot."
"Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an over-accommodating insurance grunt, trying his best to climb the corporate ladder by offering favors to his superiors. In this case, those favors include the use of his bachelor pad for extramarital affairs, and Baxter often finds himself literally shut out in the cold while the bigwigs have their fun. At heart, it's a tale of the meek taking orders from the boastful, allowing themselves to be taken advantage of for fear of a distant, looming consequence. Baxter soaks up this treatment, of course, but so does his longtime crush, the lovely elevator girl Fran (Shirley MacLaine), who's found herself tangled in the complicated web of an office manager. Both reach personal lows, defeated by the world and pestered by constant external irritations, but see something familiar in each other that gradually nurtures a renewed sense of self-assurance. Hopeful without feeling unrealistic, melancholy but not menacing, draining and also uplifting, it smoothly harvests a large crop of emotions before producing a set of forever-altered characters in the closing shot. Very well-made, affecting cinema that still feels relevant fifty-plus years later, my only nitpick is that it drags just a bit in getting to the point of the third act."
"5. Corporate executives have never needed to borrow shabby apartments for an office affair. That's what hotels and cash are for.4. Nor do executives openly expose themselves as cads and philanderers to their underlings.3. Far from being a hero, the tenant (Jack Lemmon) is a blindly ambitious and contemptible toady for vacating his apartment whenever his bedroom is needed by his boss-- correction, bosses, plural, because five(!) executives use his apartment. If he charged them for it, he'd still be contemptible, but at least he wouldn't be a schnook.2. The girl (Shirley MacLaine) is simultaneously tough-talking and so vulnerable that she becomes suicidal when her obviously predatory boss (Fred Macmurray) treats her like a whore. She's no victim. She has an affair with a married man. He doesn't respect her. Big surprise.1. All these things add up to Billy Wilder and screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond trying to have it both ways-- comic and tragic. They convinced most of the audience (and the Academy) that Lemmon and Maclaine's characters are basically good and decent in an amoral world, but I'm not buying it. However much Wilder/Diamond try to manipulate the plot, the actions of those two characters are as amoral and selfish as any people in the film. The happy ending is appropriate, of course, because two perfectly matched chumps have found each other."
"The Apartment is a movie I'm not 100% sure I like or not. I just LOVE the cast mind you.. Jack Lemmon! Shirley Maclaine! Fred Macmurray! I guess it must be how sad everyone is during this movie. Oh sure, there seems to be some sort of resolvement in the end, but aside from that, everyone seems to just go through life's rituals in the most routine way possible. The ironic thing is that for the very few people that are NOT sad sacks, are the ones who are somewhat immoral, and cheating on their wives and what not. Or, when you're drunk, or both. Take a look at the Christmas party at C.C. Baxter's company during Christmas time. Compare it with any other time, where it's deadly serious and quiet. So why is it that the sadder ones have the more worries and the more happy ones seem to fly by without a care in the world? I'm not sure, and I think this is one of the problems leaves up to the viewer, which I think is quite brilliant. Jack Lemmon is, what he always seems to be, and that's brilliant. Shirley Maclaine is quite good here as well, playing with a certain edge I haven't seen her portray before. And Fred Macmurray seems to be having a ball again playing someone with absolutely no scruples whatsoever (aka Double Indemnity)."
"Apparently this hasn't aged well, because many of the things that happen in the movie seem completely and totally unrealistic. Why would a bunch of executives need to use an apartment as their landing point for extramarital affairs? Couldn't they go to a hotel like any self-respecting philanderer?I did not laugh one time.This movie's premise was good, but several things plagued the movie to me: 1. it was too long. this plot was pretty standard and didn't need run for 2 hours.2, A sweet girl dates a married man who is the top executive in a company? Perhaps she isn't all that sweet to begin with. If you want us to believe you just love someone, try to have him not be the richest guy in the whole movie.Brother-in-law scene did nothing to advance the plot.Their 'love' didn't make much sense. I mean we knew he was crazy about her, but where did all of her love for him develop? And if thats the case how did she marry Sheldrake anyway? And how did her love for him develop so strongly that she just leaves Sheldrake at the drop of a hat, I though she loved Sheldrake?If it were funnier and shorter, I suppose it would have been more enjoyable, but I definitely do not understand its appeal. Its a decent movie, but I wouldn't watch it again."
"Going into ""The Apartment"", I had very high expectations. I was hoping the plotline of 5 people using the same apartment to cheat on their wives would be the core of the movie. And that is one hell of a premise for a comedy, so I was excited.Unfortunately, that aspect is pushed to the background about 40 minutes in and the movie turns into a full-fledged romance. And a very typical one at that. A beautiful girl is wanted by a good guy and a bad guy. She's in love with the bad guy, but he keeps mistreating her, so the good guy sweeps in and we wait for her to make the right choice for about an hour. I'm sure this concept was not much less typical in 1960 than it is now. And it's really hard to root for a resolution. Baxter is the guy the viewer naturally feels compassion for (and the movie is certainly fixated on making us feel sorry for him), but the girl is clearly not all that into him and she only decides to settle for him after she's delivered 5 dramatic monologues about the hopelessness of unrequited love and being involved in a love affair with a married man. She doesn't even reciprocate his declaration of love in the end. I must admit this is certainly not unrealistic, but as a movie ending, it falls short for me.Sidenote : the ""wise"" joke really wore thin, didn't it?"
"This movie is extraordinarily so far ahead of its time and it just does not age. I saw it first in Ireland, many many years ago when censorship still reigned freely over that fair land and the scissors of the censor wore out with all the snips in this one ( another great ""cutting"" movie was Gigi, don't get me started!).When I saw it years later I was overjoyed at what an absolute delight it was. Imagine a movie about clandestine sex without any sex being shown at all. Not even one kiss between any of the major characters. Not even at the end when you know it's all going to work out and they're going to have a cottage and kids and everything.Jack Lemmon, playing C.C. Baxter, who was reined in pretty tightly by Billy, gives an outstanding performance. Jack underplaying anything is to be treasured (another wonderful gem being ""Dad""). Here he is a wage slave in a huge life insurance company, a drone among many, but a bachelor with his own apartment much desired by his promiscuous bosses for their affairs. With the carrot of promotions dangled in front of him, C.C. obliges them by letting them use it and spends most of his off hours pacing in front of his apartment waiting for the clandestine couples to leave.the movie adds multiple layers to this. It is a comment on the soul-less offices of the day when men like C.C.'s bosses preyed on their female underlings and the loneliness of lives in the big city without community is highlighted.The black and white filming, stark in its depiction of New York, the sound track, the brilliant script which lifts what could be mundane to the level of the sublime, the believable characters of C.C. and Fran (Played by a luminous Shirley Maclaine) who never, even to the end, fall into a maudlin mess, all contribute to get a rare 10 out of 10 from me.Five viewings later, I'm looking forward to my sixth."
"C.C. Baxter is a junior clerk with a giant New York insurance corporation who has found an unusual way to get on. He is the tenant of a small apartment which he allows senior executives of the firm to use for sexual assignments with their mistresses. He does this not in exchange for money but on the understanding that the managers involved will use their influence to advance his career. As a result Baxter quickly finds himself promoted from his lowly position to that of a junior executive with his own office and a key to the executive washroom. Complications arise, however, when Baxter falls in love with Fran Kubelik, the elevator girl who just happens to be the mistress of Jeff Sheldrake, the head of the company's personnel department, who has often taken Fran and his other mistresses back to Baxter's apartment. This film is in the tradition of the ""sophisticated"" comedies centred upon adultery and divorce which were considered very daring and risqué in the forties and fifties. Director Billy Wilder had made another film of this type, ""The Seven Year Itch"", several years earlier. The difference between that film and ""The Apartment"" perhaps reflects the growth in permissiveness which took place between the mid-fifties and the early sixties, ""The Apartment"" being considerably bolder in its treatment of sexual themes. In ""The Seven Year Itch"", Marilyn Monroe's character is the object of the fantasies of the married man who lives below her, but nothing ever takes place between them. In ""The Apartment"", however, although there are no bedroom scenes, we are given to understand that adulterous sex takes place in Baxter's apartment on a regular basis (to the horror of his neighbour, a Jewish doctor, who mistakenly believes that Baxter himself is the lover of all these different women). Moreover, the film is a romantic comedy which has as its heroine a woman who is conducting an affair with a married man, something that would have been unthinkable a few years previously. In this respect ""The Apartment"" can be seen as looking forward to the fully-fledged sex comedies of the late sixties and seventies and to modern rom-coms in which it is no longer necessary that the characters be chaste and virginal. It was also one of the first films to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace, something that has become a staple theme of modern office-based films. In other respects, however, it is rather old-fashioned. In a seventies sex comedy Baxter would probably have been presented as an attractive jack-the-lad whose pursuit of self-interest is wholly admirable, Fran as a go-getter happy to sleep with her boss all the time she thinks she is in with a chance of becoming the second Mrs Sheldrake but equally happy to throw him over when she realises he is not serious about her, and Sheldrake himself as a groovy swinger. ""The Apartment"" takes a more moralistic line. Baxter may not be the drunken womaniser that Dr Dreyfuss imagines him to be, but the film condemns his conniving at the sexual immorality of others for the sake of his own self-advancement. Fran is hopelessly in love with Sheldrake, even after she discovers how insincere and selfish he is. At times the comedy becomes much blacker than the average romantic comedy; Fran's suicide attempt shows how dangerous and destructive the casual philandering of a man like Sheldrake can be. Another difference between this film and the more traditional romantic comedy is that the humour is often very satirical in nature. Most of the satire is at the expense of American big business- the impersonality of big corporations (Baxter proudly announces that his firm employs more people than the total population of Natchez, Mississippi), the culture of corporate philandering, the bullying of junior staff by senior management, the snobbery of the top brass. Combined with the satire is a more serious study in character development, of how Fran overcomes her hopeless infatuation with Sheldrake and how Baxter becomes (in Dreyfuss's words) a ""Mensch"" by learning that his love for Fran is of more import than his selfish pursuit of success by dubious means and that there are more important things in life than who gets the key to the executive washroom. (The word ""Mensch"" is German for ""human being""; its use in this film, and the character of Dreyfuss himself, possibly reflect Billy Wilder's own German-Jewish roots). The script is often witty and Jack Lemmon as Baxter shows just why he was regarded as being among the best comedy actors of the period. (At times, as in ""Days of Wine and Roses"", he got the chance to show that he could be a very good actor in serious dramas as well). Nevertheless, I am surprised that the film won the ""best picture"" Oscar ahead of not only ""Elmer Gantry"" but also ""Spartacus"" and ""Psycho"", neither of which were even nominated. It is overlong, and the character of Fran seems problematic for a modern audience. Shirley MacLaine does her best to portray her as a feisty, independent woman, but this portrayal sometimes seems at odds with the way the character is written. The fact that she remains hopelessly devoted to Sheldrake even after it becomes clear to her what a scoundrel he is can make her seem weak and passive. Perhaps the audiences of the early sixties would only accept as a romantic heroine a woman involved in an adulterous affair if it was made clear that she was truly in love with him. This is an entertaining film, which has dated better than ""The Seven Year Itch"", but I would not rate it as highly as Wilder's other great comedy from this period, ""Some Like It Hot"". 7/10"
"I wasn't a huge fan of Billy Wilder's ""Some Like it Hot"" when I first saw it some years ago, but ""The Apartment"" didn't let me down at all. Jack Lemmon is superb as C.C. Baxter, the meek corporate worker who loans his apartment out to co-workers so they can spend alone time with their mistresses. In exchange for his services, Baxter is rewarded with high praise and before he knows it he is climbing the corporate ladder to success.The movie also stars Shirley MacLaine as the young woman Baxter falls in love with, and Fred MacMurray as his boss -- and the man who also has his sex-hungry eyes on MacLaine.In fact in one of cinema's greatest cases of irony, Baxter accepts tickets to a play from MacMurray in exchange for a night in his hotel room. Baxter invites his crush to go with him -- little does he know that she's the girl going to his own apartment that very night with MacMurray's character! ""The Apartment"" must have been very risqué and controversial when it was first released in 1960. This was an era of squeaky-clean, bright and colorful romantic comedies and this put a harsh twist on everything. The implications of sex are none-too-subtle and one of Baxter's neighbors tells him to keep the noise down at night -- followed by innuendo that nowadays would almost garner a film a PG-13 rating! Lemmon is really great in his role and displays perfect comic timing and Woody Allen-like nervous twitches and neurosis. Teamed with Billy Wilder it really is a great combination and the film itself is engaging and thoroughly entertaining.""The Apartment"" -- along with other 1960s films such as ""The Hustler"" and ""Midnight Cowboy"" -- helped pave the way for future films, but its revolutionary status does not outweigh its lasting impact as a quality feature. This movie holds up on its own. Some films gain reputations due to their effect and for nostalgic purposes on behalf of critics and audiences; ""The Apartment"" really is a great movie and still is."
"THE APARTMENT is a romantic comedy which, at an explicit and fun way, shows two frustrated and lonely souls in a capitalist madness. Loneliness and love have resisted to a business greed and a loose moral. Mr. Wilder has filled delicious humor with a sentimental and melancholic tone.The main protagonist is a lonely office drudge at a national insurance corporation in a high-rise building in New York City. He allows four company managers, in order to climb the corporate ladder, to lend his apartment for their extramarital affairs. His neighbors assume that he is a playboy, who's bringing home different women every night. Soon, his personnel director becomes the fifth occupant"" of the apartment. However, the director's mistress might be a problem...Some very sensitive topics, such as the exploitation of women as sexual objects or corporate power of men, have been masterfully handled through comical situations. Mr. Wilder had a clear goal. He has managed to make the audience laugh and at the same time he showed some of diseases of a capitalist society.A crazy sexy comedy on the border of good taste, through a festive mood, goes into a serious romantic drama. The protagonists become dark and dramatic in the second half of the film. A very good characterization comes to the fore. Romance is lost in satirical reviews on human ambition, viciousness and infidelity.Jack Lemmon as Calvin Clifford (C. C.) ""Bud"" Baxter is a proved comedian and dominant character. A character, who will discover, in the hard way, that love and advancement in a company are not closely related. His acting virtuosity is evident in almost every scene. Shirley MacLaine as Fran Kubelik is a big trouble. A woman who suffers from the syndrome of ""a powerful man"". They are like two sparks of flame which cannot light a candle. I think she does not love him, but, unlike the others, she understands him.Their support are Fred MacMurray (Jeff D. Sheldrake) as an evil boss and inconclusive lover, Jack Kruschen (Dr. Dreyfuss) as the voice of reason and Ray Walston, Willard Waterman, David Lewis and David White as horny wolves.These films are like a good wine, which has accidentally spilled from a barrel."
"The movie is already half a century old but it has kept its charm which makes it worthy of being considered a classic.This is one of the early romantic comedies. But besides fun moments there is also a lot of drama and a pretty original idea for the story. No wonder it won so many Oscars in 1960! On the first glance it may seem like the ah so boring good guy vs bad boy story and the female that finally gets a clue, but it is more than that. We have Baxter who lends his apartment for influential coworkers to climb the corporate ladder and we have Fran, the elevator girl, who has an affair with the boss while he promises to get a divorce. There is a parallel in their stories as they both agree to be mistreated by people with more power hoping for a better life and not seeing yet that even when they get it, it won't be as happy.A smart story is brought to us by a great cast. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are easy to identify with and they show some great acting skills with a lot of face expressions and gestures that perfectly show us the feelings of the character. I especially like Shirley MacLaine, she has some spark in her and so much freshness that take over the screen. She wasn't a big star yet when she made the movie but then she deservingly became one. Supporting cast was great as well. Jack Kruschen as Dr. Dreyfuss was great.A good movie with a good story, great cats and well presented atmosphere of its times."
"Billy Wilder is a really swell guy. He takes serious matter and makes it entertaining: Sunset Blvd. blew me away, and now The Apartment has put a big smile on my face. Wilder injects this uppity- atmosphere into almost every scene and it makes the film a pleasure to watch, no matter how serious the plot gets. And behind the charm of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, there is a serious plot.The Apartment is about Baxter, a New York business cog, trying to move up in his company not through hard work, or extra socializing, or self- pitching, but by lending his apartment to his coworkers' extra-martial affairs. Being a 60's film, this cannot be said directly, but the hinting is so strong you pick up instantly. The film is quite liberal, content-wise. The film shows that blackmail goes both ways: Baxter may believe he has the upper hand, with his clients on a string... but he does not, and he sinks deeper into his lie. Of course it comes across humorously, with his neighbours scolding him for his 'sexpot' antics, though the good doctor would also like if his body could be donated to science.Baxter is quite a character, an innocent everyman with his own set of faults and quirks. Lemmon is magnetic: we always root for Lemmon, even as he tells pitiful lies to his landlady and can't stand up to his clients. Even his borderline creepy knowledge of Ms. Kubelik comes off as just charm. An immensely likable character.The object of his affection, Fran Kubelik, is also quite a charmer. Her problem is men, but she knows it. She doesn't fake innocence. We have all known that flirty girl who ends up on your nerves... but Fran isn't that girl. Wilder knows just how to handle his characters.Now, more than 50 years after its release, trying to look at The Apartment academically is strange, because its era has passed. Things like that don't happen any more. Right? Perhaps not as specifically, but the cost of power is a universal theme. What do you sacrifice to try and get ahead? Property, dignity, even your love? C.C. Baxter knows how much he'll give, but also what he won't. The film ends positively, which is nice, and deserving, especially after seeing Sunset Blvd. The Apartment is wonderful, sharply written and performed, and makes a great evening. 8.9/10"
"The Apartment is a classic comedy. It has a great cast, a funny story and is unique. I have seen many movies but none like this. This film manages to have dramatic moments and moments that will make you laugh out loud. you will not regret watching this comedy. After all it is on the greatest movies of all time list for a reason. This is a rare movie that has both extremely serious moments and moments that you cannot take seriously. Most movies that attempt this are terrible but this one makes it work. I would recommend this to fans of classic comedies or fans of Shirley maclaine, jack lemmon, and fred macmurray. Watch this film as soon as possible."
"A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history."
"From the 1st scene itself I knew that this movie is going to be hilarious. This was my 1st movie starring Lemmon. I would say that just like Bill Murray, he also has a flavor of his own for comedy (May be I am saying this from my hangover of Groundhog Day). A very typical setup but quite an unusual story. It deals with extra-marital affairs in a comical fashion along with the senior-junior relationship in a typical office setting. The movie gets to its point somewhere towards the end of 1st hour where Lemmon, his boss and a female are unknowingly strangled in a relationship. The movie shows, as to what extent people can go for their ambitions but somewhere down the line they realize that it is the personal life which needs to be happy 1st for professional to be blooming. Also people's incapability to differentiate between true love and infatuation is dealt with nicely in the screenplay. Some of the scenes had really smart & funny moves on Lemmon's part as he tries to juggle with his seniors. I guess it is one of the very few comedy movies to win Oscars, a perfect mix of comedy and drama indeed."
"Billy Wilder's masterpiece The Apartment is everything one wants in a romantic comedy.  Its humour is omnipresent yet subtle, its themes and concepts ring true, and its two leads perform with exceptional charisma. Jack Lemmon gives one of the best performances of his career as the bound and determined C.C. ""Bud"" Baxter, a man who'll do anything to get ahead. Shirley MacClaine is charming and moving as Fran Kubelik, an elevator object who is the object of both Baxter's, and his boss' (Fred MacMurray) affection.  Truly a perfect comedy, with wit and charm to spare."
"A ridiculously overrated film. I liked it when I saw it as a kid. But now, many years later - and (hopefully) with a few more functioning brain cells than before - I find the film to be very disappointing. The main characters are absurd and their motivations make little sense. The supporting cast plays characters right out of a comic-book. All this superficiality and absurdity wouldn't matter at all if only this were a proper comedy. Unfortunately, it isn't one. In fact, it isn't even a half-comedy (the consensus seems to be that it is a comedy drama). This is a romantic drama; the laughs are as scarce and dispersed as bushes in a North African desert. The film plays up the near-perfection and integrity of its two main leads, but it simply doesn't wash in MacLaine's case. If she is such an angel why is she a home-wrecker who goes out with a married man with kids? And does it have to be one of the company's top executives as well? Women with this kind of behaviour are never (not rarely - never) seeking ""love"". I don't see how Wilder expected the adult audience to swallow this. (But apparently they did, the cretins.) Her suicide attempt is too far-fetched and overly dramatic. And what's with Lemmon's character? This guy is so self-sacrificing and noble that Wilder should have had him nailed to the cross in the last scene. The basic plot outline of the film is good and there was real potential there for a terrific situation comedy, but Wilder took the easy route and turned this into a schmaltzy romance film with the Hollywood violins accompanying every schmaltzy scene. The charisma of the two leads simply isn't enough to drag this movie out of the mud. The jokes and gags that there are, are mostly primitive - outdated at best; for example, the scene with the racket and something (unfunny) Lemmon says about the backhand. Why is this pap in IMDb's top 250 movies? Are people really that nostalgic about old movies and their schmaltz? If you'd like to read my ""biographies"" of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood people, contact me by e-mail."
"I expected a lot of comedy, but this is depressing. Without Jack Lemmon clowning around, it's just a suicide story - you can't beat the tyrants, no matter what the final scene says.Lots of character in the acting, but no genuine laughs. Can't understand why this rates so high.I expected a lot of comedy, but this is depressing.

"If you are looking for sexual tension, passion and complex characters, like I was when I started seeing this - you have come to the wrong place. If however, you are entertained by the prototypical stereotype of the ""romantic"" films of the modern times, with a nice guy courting the girl of the bad boy story, go for! We enter a cubicle type work place with a hierarchy. There is the protagonist, who is a spineless, reactive and wussy nice guy, manipulated by everyone. He falls in ""love"" with the naive, ""goodhearted"" girl living in the la-la land and working in the elevator - the female lead.Tolerating everything, submitting to every demand and being used by his co-workers for his apartment, he stumbles upon two musical tickets his boss ""gifts"" to him... in exchange for the keys to the apartment, where he plans to bring the elevator girl, who the boss himself is in lust with and who he happens to be screwing for a while. So the male protagonist hands his balls over to the elevator girl, while convinces her to see the musical. Naturally, she flakes and while he patiently waits outside for her, she is with his boss at his place.While still in lust with the bad boy, the nice guy keeps chasing and chasing while the boss continues to manipulates both of them. ""Naturally"", by being very very very nice (as in having weak personal boundaries, low self esteem and the disease to please) he keeps convincing the girl to like him. The female lead gets emotional, neurotic and suicidal after realizing that the bad boy has no intention to leave his wife. After saving her, the obligatory ""Why can't I fall in love with a nice guy like you"" follows. After showing some character and hesitantly standing up for his ""values"" or lack thereof the boy gets the girl, because ""she deserves better"".While it is a very nice (emphasis on nice) story on the so repeated male dichotomy, it does provide a few occasional but unintended laughs. Unfortunately it offers very little besides that because the characters are too immature and archetypical to relate to.This irony is that this is the kind of plot I got bored of in the modern movies after being blown away by classics like ""Gone with the wind"", ""Streetcar named desire"" and ""It happened one night""."
"Jack Lemmon in most of his films that I can remember usually had me turning it off; this is not the case with `Missing' (qv) in which he plays a surprisingly good rôle, and in `The Apartment' in which he is superb. He carries the film  practically by himself. Shirley MacLaine is just about OK, ditto Fred MacMurray and the rest of the cast. But that is precisely the magic of this classic almost in form of stage-theatre: the sum of the parts do not add up to the whole. The end result is a fine example of classic comedy in best 60's style.The film was shown here on TV last night coinciding with the death of Billy Wilder, but programmed and recorded (presentation, discussion etc.) before he died: a fitting tribute to this European-born man.The film, in black and white, is slightly dated only due to the music, as it is definitely in the style of 40's and 50's melodramas and the like. However: don't miss this one. The IMDb voting average is just about right  and that is very high on my scale, especially for a `comedy'."
"The APARTMENT (1960) is, as best I can phrase it, a perfect melding of comedy, romance, drama, corporate climbing, mistreatment,stomach pumps, gin rummy, Jewish neighbors, Jack Lemmon, and Shirley MacLaine.Every time that I am in a nasty mood, I sit down and watch this movie on my DVR. I immediately feel 110% better-- mood-wise. From the opening credits near Central Park (which I am desperate to see) to the ending words ""shut up and deal"", this movie is one of my top ten, and that's saying something.As Robert Osbourne put it in his introduction on Turner Classic Movies, The Apartment ""is at once touching and witty, perceptive, hilarious, heart-breaking and quite wonderful.""Let me state this as simply as I can: I am thirteen years old and still this film touches my heart. Jack Lemmon is incredibly sweet in this movie and is one of my favorite actors of all time.For any strange person who hasn't seen this marvelous movie, here's a summary: C.C. ""Bud"" Baxter, a corporate climber, allows his employers to use his apartment for affairs with young women, and helps the woman he loves recover from heartache inside its walls.Altogether, this movie is categorized as a MUST-SEE-MULTIPLE-TIMES, and I have one thing to say to any Apartment-obsessed IMDb user such as myself: ""Be a Mensh!!"""
"Jack Lemmon is an account executive who gets promotions by lending out his apartment to superiors in ""The Apartment,"" also starring Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray, Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, Edie Adams and David Lewis. One of the best parts of the film for me was that in 1960, a one bedroom apartment in the West 50s in New York City was a mere $85 a month. Today you couldn't get the doorknob for that.C.C. Baxter is a lonely man whose life consists of work and overtime until people have cleared out of his apartment so he can return home. Once there, he has a TV dinner and sits in front of the TV. He's totally at the mercy of his bosses who stay longer than they should, leave him walking in the rain and cold until all hours and wake him up in the middle of the night when they meet someone in a bar. All married men fooling around. Tony Curtis claims the inspiration for this Wilder film came from him and a place he and several of his friends used for trysts.At work, C.C. is interested in the gamine elevator operator Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), but his heart is broken when he realizes that she's gone back to the head of the company, Sheldrake (MacMurray) after parting with him when she saw no future in the relationship. Worse, they're meeting at his apartment, and one night, after another realization that Sheldrake is just playing her, she attempts suicide. When she has to stay at his apartment to recover, the lonely man realizes just how lonely he's been.This is a wonderfully crafted movie and a real tour de force for Lemmon, who portrays a sad, beleaguered character out of step with the mores of his office. MacLaine is vulnerable and sweet as Fran, who loves Sheldrake in spite of herself. The cheating spouses - Ray Walston, David Lewis, MacMurray et al. do a great job at being completely unlikable. Edie Adams has a nice role as Sheldrake's secretary and ex-girlfriend, and Baxter's neighbors, who all think he's a real swinger, are very funny - Jack Kruschen and Naomi Stevens.The script is witty and cynical, pure Wilder in its look at the men of corporate America, the dumb wives at home, and the women they seduce. The character of C.C. Baxter is out of his league here, too sensitive and too nice to be in with this crowd, and Fran is too loving and good-hearted to be with a man like Sheldrake. Wilder puts these characters into a cold, unfeeling world where somehow they find one another. Maybe not so cynical after all."
"Spoilers herein.I have just had quite an argument with a well known film critic. He maintains that films are either good or bad and any good film is just simply good. I maintained that films are little worlds. Some are created more successfully than others. Some are more novel or clever or valuable than others. Navigating your way through film is part of building a life worth living.This film is a good example of what I mean. It is pleasant enough. It is well enough brought into being. But it is damaged goods.The situation is supposed to sharply display a late fifties environment of a man trapped in a mechanical organization, having to cater to the norms of that organization with wit and grace. The situation centers on sex. Now, after a few decades, it becomes clear that Wilder himself was in the same situation. Early, he could make intelligent, edgy films. ""Sunset"" is a masterpiece. But by this time, he was a chef in someone else's kitchen, turning out perfect pastries. Lemmon and MacLaine do cute as well as anyone from that period.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."
"There is some charm to be found in this movie, but it's overshadowed by the unctuous meanness of the philandering executives, the spazziness of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, and the frustration of watching the latter be walked all over by the former. I've never been a fan of the humor of avoidable embarrassment, and this movie is full of it. Many of the scenes of Baxter's interactions with other characters are unwatchably painful. Or painfully unwatchable. Maybe both. And many of the jokes just haven't aged well -- maybe at one time the appending of ""-wise"" to all sorts of words was a funny comment on how businessmen butchered the language, but today it's stale and repetitive.Shirley MacLaine is great. Her presence, combined with Lemmon's performance in the few scenes where he's allowed to stop spazzing, is the only thing that makes this movie minimally worthwhile. Overall, balancing the bad against the good, this is movie is just plain unpleasant."
"On 01 November 1959, in New York, C.C. ""Bud"" Baxter (Jack Lemon) is a popular clerk of ""Consolidate Life"", an insurance company with 31,259 employees. The secret of his success is a well located apartment where he lives that he sublets for his superiors, making him climb to the executive position of 2nd Administrative Assistant very early. He likes the elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), a reserved woman considered a ""jackpot"" among the executives. Fran is the secret lover of the director Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), a married man that seduced her convincing that he will divorce his wife to stay with her. When Fran tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment after a meeting with Jeff, she stays with Baxter while recovering, and he falls in love for her. Later he has to come up to a decision between his excellent position in the company and his love.""The Apartment"" is one of the most delightful movies of Hollywood ever and fairly ranked # 95 in IMDb. In my opinion, Billy Wilder is the best director Hollywood has ever had, and this dramatic comedy is one of his many masterpieces. The screenplay is simply perfect, developing very well each character with great lines. Shirley MacLaine is very sweet and it is impossible not falling in love for her character, who has the talent of falling in love for the wrong guy, in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Jack Lemon has another amazing performance in the role of a man that sells his soul to climb positions in his company, and redeems himself with pure love. Fred MacMurray is also excellent in the role of a seductive scum. The soundtrack presents a wonderful very well known musical theme. The list of awards, with five Oscars, another seventeen wins and eight nominations is enough to show how perfect this movie is. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Se Meu Apartamento Falasse"" (""If My Apartment Speaks"")Note: On 06 June 2009, I watched this movie again."
"The Apartment does what most love stories and perhaps no romantic comedies do, which makes it as emotionally stirring as it is. It has one person in deep emotional trouble because she's in love with someone else, and the other person is hopeless in love with her, and not only that, walked on by everyone constantly. And frankly, you really tend to care a great deal, because the film spares us nothing and really holds back on offering us relief until the last few minutes.Jack Lemmon's character is a hard-working employee at an insurance company whom other higher-standing employees use for his apartment, so that they can bring adulterous dates and flings there when they need a place to get busy, always landing Lemmon out on the street for awhile to wait till he can return to the warmth of his home. This is only the beginning of how badly and infuriatingly he is treated throughout the movie, and Lemmon's character is so envious in how he handles it. He's a man who constantly looks up at things, hardly affected by the extremely negative situations of things. When he is punched in the face by an assuming man when Lemmon really has done nothing wrong, Lemmon lies there, nose bleeding, thinking about how thrilling it is that he's been punched in the face in the name of a woman. It's hard to be like he is but it's not hard for the breezy likes of him. Why is this so hard for the rest of us? Why can't we, at our most resilient, feel the way he does towards life, and go through it with such a sensibility where he intellectualizes his feelings? The film has great atmosphere, as it takes place over the course of Christmas and New Years, which adds lots of emotional effect to its story. It's a very relieving film."
"The film industry has benefited many times when friends have decided to work on a picture together. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise are some examples. But none are greater than Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon. In The Apartment, Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a lonely man living and working in New York City. He works at an insurance company called Consolidated Life. His desk is on the nineteenth floor but his superiors have been using him with the promise that they will recommend him for a promotion. A key has been floating around the office and Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) on the twenty-seventh floor calls Baxter into his office to question him about it. Mr. Sheldrake tells Baxter that it has come to his attention that there are four rotten apples in the company. It soon becomes obvious that Mr. Sheldrake also wishes to use the apartment. Once Baxter allowed one colleague to use his apartment to change into his tuxedo on the way to a function, he has not been able to refuse it to anyone. But one night changes his outlook. Jack Lemmon is amazing with his subtle humor and genuine kindness. He expertly portrays the sweet but disappointed C.C. Baxter. Fred MacMurray is sleazy and despicable as the careless adulterer. The role of Fran Kubelik was perfectly cast with Shirley MacLaine. She is excellent as the broken hearted woman trying to pick up the pieces of her life. The Apartment was written and directed by Billy Wilder. His screenplay is filled with witty comments but also sincere brutal honesty about the issues people deal with. The main character is forced to choose what he believes in: working his way to the top in any way he can or being a good, honest person. The cinematography in this film is very beautiful. Wilder used interesting shots of New York City for the setting of his tale. It is easy to understand why this film won the best picture academy award."
"C.C. (Jack Lemmon) works as an accountant for a large New York City firm. There are so many employees, C.C. realizes, that getting ahead in the company is an almost impossible task. That is, until he discovers the firm's big wigs will do him some grand favors IF he lets them use his convenient apartment for their many dalliances. C.C. agrees to the arrangement and is often left on the doorstep, waiting for entry into his own habitat again. Meanwhile, C.C. has a crush on a pretty, perky elevator girl named Fran (Shirley MacLaine). Trouble is, unknown to C.C., Fran has been involved with the head of the company, Jeff (Fred McMurray). Jeff is married, of course, but that did not keep him from having his good times with Fran. The day arrives, naturally, when Jeff wants to meet Fran at C.C.'s place. Will anything good come out of deception and adultery? This is a wonderful movie, despite its serious subject matter. Lemmon gives one of his best performances as C.C. and charms the audience at every moment with his humor, good looks, and manic energy. MacLaine, likewise, is attractive and funny as the lady taken for a self-serving ride by the company's big man. Add in a down-and-dirty performance by McMurray and you have a dream cast. The secondary actors are all quite wonderful, too, and so are the costumes, settings, and production. Then, too, the script is stunning; make that a ditto for Wilder's direction. Have you been putting off a showing of this film for a rainy day? Please do not wait any longer and head out the door this instant to get this film into your clutches and onto your television screen."
"Billy Wilders acid-like satire on the double side of American middle-class morality is great stuff even after almost 50 years of wear. Jack Lemmon, in perhaps his best part, is fantastic as the quiet paper-pusher Baxter who is exploited to the maximum by his cynical employees, while he is left with nothing (career-wise and any other...wise), except for his honest intentions, being the only one in the firm with some sense of dignity and respect for human values. Fred MacMurray, in my opinion, never had a better part as the spineless boss. And Jack Kruschen gets everything out of the doctor next door! A total delight from start to finish, and despite of the comedy theme never neglecting the important one: remember to be decent! Make note of the amazing pacing and dialog that sets new standards even for a Wilder-film!"
"Gorgeous wide-screen black-and-white is not something you see every day, so imagine my pleasant surprise as I stumbled half-blind into the cinema to see New York City unfold before me, with Jack Lemmon's marvellous voice-over effortlessly introducing us to the slightly crazed but very recognisable world of C.C. Baxter.  Here he is in his enormous office building, surrounded by identically-dressed worker-drones, piling in and out of elevators operated by stunning girls in uniforms, running the show with amazing efficiency.  What makes Baxter special is not his work - oh, no; he's as hard-working as the next guy, no more, no less.  What singles him out for special attention from those (literally) above him is his apartment. And very handy it is too, for guys needing somewhere central to take a special lady for an hour or two, no questions asked, no prying eyes, no hotel bills, no wife on the phone.  Baxter has somehow got himself into a situation where his apartment, and, indeed, his life, is not his own. Lemmon is ideally cast in the role, with his nothing-special looks and his slightly ridiculous voice.  It makes those moments where he's really charming all the more valuable and striking.  His occasional little dances and the classic ""straining the spaghetti"" scene come to mind.  As comedies go, this is very grim and cynical.  Office life is a dog-eat-dog nightmare, with promotion available to those who do favours for their superiors rather than those who work hard.  Married men are all having affairs, with very few raised eyebrows or dissenting voices.  Baxter is not morally upset by all these guys using his apartment, it's just inconvenient.  In fact, it's only when the woman of his dreams, the lovely Miss Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine, at her very best) turns out to be one of those special ladies, who just happens to be involved with the big boss, J. D. Sheldrake, that things have got to be stopped.  But is it too late?  Suicide, extra-marital affairs, jokes about sexual stamina, the wildest office party you ever saw - it's all here in this delightful romantic comedy.  Back in the day when movies were about something, this was something special, even then.  But now, when movies are about nothing much, this is a masterpiece.  A grim, troubling, hilarious masterpiece."
"For me, Billy Wilder's amazingly successful run of genre-hopping movies is peppered with things I like, and other crowd-pleasing movies that I really don't. Often, within a single Wilder movie I find pleasure and annoyance (Stalag 17, Breakfast at Tiffany's). And I've never made it through any attempt to watch ""Some like it Hot."" I find ""The Apartment"" similarly annoying. This may be the only comedy from the 60s that attempts to wring laughs from an attempted suicide. But if it's a comedy it's not black enough. The suicide is treated like a perfectly typical subplot and a terrific way to poach a girlfriend. After the first ten minutes, every development gets a lazier and lazier set-up, making the characters seem like real idiots. I just didn't buy a minute of it.MacMurray is a complete unrelenting heel in this. There isn't a single frame where he isn't completely unlikeable. And some dingbat ""nice girl"" feels unrequited love for him? Why is someone like Fran pursuing this giant a-hole? Why should I care about a woman this stupid? This movie made me pine for the 'noir' era, where viewers were never asked to identify with characters this sappy.When Fran's brother-in-law finally comes to retrieve her under the misunderstanding that Lemmon has been having his way with her, no one even bothers to set him straight. The script foists a neighbor into the moment so there's a pretext for Lemmon not explaining, but nothing prevents stupid MacClaine from doing so (and she lets Lemmon get decked). In this era C.C. and Fran would both know their reputations were at stake and they'd need to address the brother's concerns immediately. The film fumbles just a couple times, but it's in all the major places, making the characters look like idiots. The Lemmon/MacClaine love story is so poorly set up that it's barely perceptible. The whole thing is off for me. This is really unfunny stuff."
"I liked the idea. I liked the story. The acting of the three central characters - Lemmon, MacLaine, MacMurray - was excellent.However, the whole plot hangs together badly. First of all, we have a key to an apartment going around the office, but if someone has vacated the apartment, they have to leave the key under the mat. Jack Lemmon has a key to the front door of the building, but not to the apartment. Strange. Couldn't he have had another key to the apartment duplicated? And if he is stuck out on a winter's night and has a key to the front door, why can't he lurk around the building until the apartment is vacant? Why does he have to spend the evening on a park bench? And if MacMurray is so well loaded, why doesn't he rent his own apartment? Lemmon's head cold also developed pretty quickly. Pity these holes in the plot ruined the film.I didn't know this film was a comedy. It didn't make me laugh. None of it did. When I was told that it was supposed to be a comedy, I couldn't believe it."
"Over the years, I have heard that THE APARTMENT was a comedy, however I really saw nothing particularly funny about the film. Instead, it's a drama about human nature and its darker instincts. A good film, yes, but I really can't see this as a comedy.Jack Lemmon plays a guy who is determined to get ahead at the huge insurance company where he works. His plan is to ingratiate himself to the supervisors so they'll notice him and owe him a promotion. The problem is that to do this, he lowers himself to the level of a pimp, of sorts. You see, the bosses all want to have a secret place to take their mistresses. Often this means that Lemmon is stuck outside waiting for these ""men"" to finish up their sexual escapades instead of sleeping or otherwise enjoying his own little apartment. However, with his eyes on the prize, no matter how thoughtless these cads are, Lemmon is always obliging.Eventually, however, the big boss (Fred MacMurray) finds out and Lemmon is happy--maybe the shenanigans can stop and he can finally have his apartment back each night. However, MacMurray, too, wants in on the love shack and his fling involves a nice lady that Lemmon has admired for some time. However, being basically a coward and power-hungry, Lemmon says nothing and goes along with MacMurray's sleazy plan.Eventually, Lemmon gets the advancements he wanted but also has a hard time living with what he's become. His neighbor's words--""do you want to be a mensch (Yiddish for 'man' or 'person')"" come to haunt him. Will he continue to do just about anything for a raise? Or, will he stand up, for once, and be a man? The movie has a lot going for it. In particular, Jack Lemmon's performance is exceptional as are the other performances. In a role that is rather against type, MacMurray plays a low down dog--a character even more unlikable than the one he played in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Otherwise, excellent direction, a gritty and amazing script and some haunting music all contribute to make this an exceptional picture--though I do think it's a tiny bit overrated (given that it received so much notice at the Oscars). Still, you can't do wrong with this surprisingly adult drama from 1960--though younger kids won't enjoy it and the sexual innuendo is a reason not to let them watch it as well."
"""The Apartment"" may be the greatest achievement in Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder's highlight-filled careers. Many critics find its story gentler than some of Wilder's other films such as ""Ace in the Hole"" and ""Double Indemnity,"" but I don't detect any artistic compromise. Wilder creates a believable, full-fledged love story that exists alongside the familiar dark humor, snappy dialogue, and depictions of immoral behavior that characterize most of his movies. Rather than diluting these essential Wilderian elements, the addition of a likable everyman, whom Jack Lemmon plays with perfection, throws them into sharper relief through contrast."
"This absolute delight from 1960 is one of Billy Wilder's best works. His Direction of the always wonderful Jack Lemmon and stunning beauty Shirley MacLaine is up there with the best of his generation. The audience can't help but be sympathetic to Lemmon's character, and root for requited love of MacLaines character.Lemmon should have won the Best Actor nod. The mixture of comedy and drama is very appealing to mass audiences, and I feel this picture will be a new favorite for fans of Lemmon or Wilder who may not be familiar with their always genius collaborations.Take some time to check it out!"
"After having finished to watch Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"", released in 1960, his second Best Picture winning film after ""The Lost Weekend"" 15 years earlier, I realized why the film didn't leave much an impact on me the first time: I expected a screwball comedy and was caught off-guard by the constant feelings of sadness and melancholy that inhabit the main characters. I felt kind of cheated 'comedy-wise'. I guess I had the right mindset this time because something deeply touched me regarding the relationship between C.C. Baxter and Fran Kubelik. (By the way, kudos to whoever from Billy Wilder or I.A.L Diamond came up with these names, hilariously catchy at first hearing but then get strangely familiar friendly-wise. )So, it's only by expecting a drama that its lighthearted aspect touched me, I didn't wait for the laughs to come yet each comedic situation worked. What is so indeed funny in the film relies essentially on an ensemble of little ironies that govern the main character C.C. Baxter. As usual, Jack Lemmon embodies with perfection the average office worker with a very small attention to the kind of little speech mannerism and details you might found in these everyday characters, he's not eccentric enough to be immediately recognizable in this vast and impressive office space (the insurance company he works in counts more than 30 thousands employees) but he manages to transcend his normality and inspire a sort of instinctive sympathy. The first irony is that Baxter is obviously the kind of awkward bachelor who's not charismatic enough to be a womanizer yet he lives the life of one. Baxter loans his apartment to some colleagues who need a spot for their '5 to 7' activities in exchanges of some vague promises of promotions. Therefore, while everyone is having a good fun in his apartment, earning Baxter one hell of a reputation, especially from his closest neighbor, the brave Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kuschyn), Baxter waits outside. Not only he doesn't have the benefit of having a good time, but he also can't even afford the comfortable intimacy that consoles from the feeling of emptiness. Because his life is indeed empty, totally dedicated to his work, insurance-wise and colleagues-wise. Another irony is that the colleagues fulfill their promises and show some gratitude toward their Buddy-Boy, that's the way they call him. So Buddy-Boy rapidly climbs the social ladder thus getting closer and closer to his boss Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Getting more self- confident, Baxter makes some advances to the cute elevator-girl Fran Kubelik, the girl that crystallizes the most vicious intentions from other men. But Shirley MacLaine delivers one of her finest performances as Fran Kubelik, all in nuance and subtlety, it's like she went through the kind of deceptions a little flower like her would have endured. She smiles, she's smart, but there's an inner sadness in her heart, like a little prey who's aware that she's meant to attract ruthless predators, but what can she do?By a delightful turn of events that only a Billy Wilder's script could have provided without making it too preposterous, we learn that Fran had a long affair with Mr. Sheldrake, who only endorsed Baxter's ascension because he needed the apartment. Sheldrake is an interesting character here because he's the closest one to an antagonist, striking by his lack of scruples. He pretends to be in love with Fran and ready for a divorce while he just can't accept the idea of losing her, he pretends to respect Baxter while he's only using his joint. Sheldrake is a character that mirrors the two leads' weaknesses: they accept their fate because they're convinced that a good payoff ought to come job-wise or marriage-wise. Sheldrake will be the romance's instrument by abandoning Fran in Baxter's flat, with a 100-dollar bill so she can buy a Christmas gift.Fran is left alone of a Christmas Eve and Baxter kills time in a bar, both are desperately lonely while they have the hearts that could fulfill the most beautiful dreams. We can't help but feel angry to see Sheldrake spending time with his Family while Fran and Baxter, live that way, incapable of finding the kind of happiness that enriched their childhood. It's not coincidental that the film takes place in a period where people loosen up and have fun, it indirectly mirrors Baxter and Fran's condition  solitude-wise. Then, the film takes a dramatic turn when Fran attempts a suicide by swallowing sleeping pills but thanks to Baxter's intervention and the providential help of Dr. Dreyfuss, she'll progressively recover. And both will get fond of each other. But they still feel obliged to Mr. Sheldrake, Baxter can't make any move on Fran, and Fran, despite everything, still embraces the improbable dream of marrying the boss. Yes, it's frustrating to see such a nice couple remaining faithful to a rotten man, but I guess Fred MacMurray has a way to always keep a friendly and gentle tone in his character. And it's not up to him anyway, to help these two lonely hearts to get together.The rest of the film is pure brilliance  script-wise and directing-wise. Billy Wilder signs a wonderful romance between two brave and gentle people who overcome their own illusions. Indeed, many Wilder's film deal with illusions, in ""Double Indemnity"", Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson committed a murder out of a passion that didn't exist for a money they wouldn't get, in ""Sunset Blvd.' Norma Desmond's delusion of grandeur and Joe Gillis' conviction that he could use her would lead to their demises ......and in ""The Apartment"", two people abandon sterile dreams when they understand that they can't depend their lives on the selfishness of one person, much more where they have so much to lose, like loving each other, and dealing with it  punchline-wise."
"It's heralded as one of the all time great comedies and even won a Best Picture Oscar, but I'm somehow just not feeling the love here. Though essentially a good hearted guy, C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is easily pushed around by his superiors at work, all with the goal of hijacking his apartment for their extramarital affairs. Fred MacMurray is cast against type as a heel with not a single redemptive quality, and I had to do a double take when he treated Shirly MacLaine's character like a hooker by pulling out that hundred dollar bill. MacLaine has some good moments, but overall, she's as one dimensional as her co-stars, which is a shame, because there were a few times that you felt genuinely sorry for her abuse at the hands of Sheldrake (MacMurray). But then you had to wonder why she didn't pull the plug on the relationship a whole lot sooner.Back to this comedy business - I can think of a few times where Lemmon's facial expressions and posture denoted an element of humor, but the more obvious attempts fell flat. Like the tennis racket spaghetti strainer - that would have been funny in a setting like ""Animal House"", but if you're trying to impress a girl with your wit, I think I'd stay away from going the unsanitary route. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? Probably more than anything else though, it's probably not wise to mix a lightweight script with a suicide attempt. There wasn't much funny about Doc Dreyfuss trying to save Miss Kubelik's (MacLaine) life and Baxter's noble gesture to nurse her back to health over the course of a couple days. I think the movie would have gotten more mileage out of going for a straight dramatic approach, but then again, I'm not the expert here and the film did win big in the Oscar race that year. Maybe I watched a different picture."
"""The Apartment"" endures as a classic film due to its great acting and writing. Jack Lemmon, as usual, is a master of comic delivery, and this is no exception (""...the way it crumbles, cookie-wise."") Shirley MacLaine is superb here, delivering a very real and believable performance as the unlucky-in-love girl, and to think she didn't win an Oscar is a crime. The interactions between her and Lemmon on the screen are the single best elements of this film, in my opinion. With great dialogue like this, there's no doubt in my mind why the film won Oscars for its original screenplay and Best Picture. Nearly everything about the film is believable, and many of us could picture these events happening in our own lives, like it or not. I do not necessarily agree with the underlying theme of adultery and the affairs people are having in this apartment, but I still managed to enjoy many aspects of this film. It's never dull for a minute, and the dialogue and events keep me fascinated the entire time. Little nuggets, such as Lemmon's famous use of a tennis racket to strain spaghetti, make this a classic. Not absolutely perfect, since some scenes can be more intense and difficult to watch, but still enjoyable. I love the romantic comedy feel this film acquires by the end. Well-written and acted, and recommended to just about any movie lover.***1/2 out of ****"
"The Apartment directed by Billy Wilder has aged well.Jack Lemmon plays C.C Baxter timid but ambitious office worker who finds his soul mate Miss Fran Kubelik played by Shirley Maclaine.Billy wilder was supposed to have taken his inspiration for The Apartment from the scene in Brief Encounter where Alec uses his friend's apartment for a secret rendezvous with Laura. So CC Baxter allows his co workers to use his apartment for liaisons.He is even approached by his boss Mr Sheldrake for the valuable apartment key.Baxter's ride up to the executive washroom is assured.However it a costly ride as Fran is seeing Mr Sheldrake played with a cool and detached air by Fred McMurray.This has to be one of the cleverest comedy dramas ever written.It seems effortless in the way it veers from light comedy to tragedy.The performances are excellent especially from Jack Lemmon - His energy and precision are a joy to behold (Note a long take where he is at his desk working out statistics- comic skill of the highest order!)Shirley Maclaine gives a genuinely strong, sweet and moving performance as Fran. Praise too also to Jack Kruschen as the mocking doctor."
"A man whose house is used as bachelor's flat by his managers in insurance company, falls in love with elevator operator Ms. Kubelik in same company. This man is C.C.Baxter who is an employee and can't resist threats of his managers. His popularity is heart by a high level manager Mr. Sheldrake and Mr. Sheldrake wants the key of his apartment as other managers did. As different from others, this one is directly related to Baxter's life because of Mrs.Kubelik, but he doesn't know anything about this fact. He learns the reality in a office party after he had been promotioned and lastly he finds Kubelik unconscious in his house. Kubelik had committed suicide with sleeping tablets before he got arrived home and after this point Sheldrake gives a promotion to him for the things that he did to Kubelik and wants for the key one more. Baxter is ready to lose salary, career and all other things not to do this.Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine did a good job in ""The Apartment"". A simple story belonging to real life could be just amazing and I had a good time while watching. Of course, it is necessary not to forget Baxter's work friends and neighbours' performance, especially Dr. Dreyfuss. The director Billy Wilder reflects his feelings related to routine facts which could be in life of most of us. The time of film can be supposed as long, but I never got bored.I haven't watched such an interesting subjected film that had been screened in 60's. Thanks to people who contributed efforts."
"I think I had this film's DVD sitting on my desk for a while now, but I finally got to watching it and I have to say that I was pleased with the results. If I recall correctly, this is probably one of the last major Hollywood black and white films because at this point, widescreen and color were both prevalent in a bid to take back viewership from television. The Apartment is in widescreen, but not in color.Directed by the prolific and sometimes groundbreaking Billy Wilder, this film benefits from his experience, as the direction is smooth, the performances are classic and the mood balances well between moments of comedy and moments of seriousness. It is a comedy, but it has a bit of an edge because of some of the tragic subject matter in the story and so it's a more human film than say, Some Like It Hot, another Billy Wilder comedy starring Jack Lemmon.The story is about a Mr. CC ""Bud"" Baxter and his quest for the career fast track in a large insurance agency. To facilitate this career ambitions, he helps out his adulterating bosses in their machinations, but as fate would have it, complications in this scheme occur when a woman enters the picture. Drama and humor ensue. The humor, however, isn't all out wacky; it's an amusing real-life sort of humor and it doesn't knock you out of your seat out of laughter, but entertains nonetheless.So with smooth and experienced direction, capable acting, and an edgy story, the film manages to be solid entertainment, even when you consider that if you put yourself in the shoes of the characters, it might not be the happiest of times. Well done and not a bad film to catch. 8/10."
"Jack Lemmon plays a nice guy sad sack and Shirley MacLaine the wayward waif with whom he's smitten in Billy Wilder's bittersweet romantic comedy that's long on the bitter and short on the sweet.Wilder nails the sterile world of corporate American anonymity in this film. Lemmon's character is a worker bee, whose work space is lost amid a sea of identical spaces, captured brilliantly by the art direction as a black and white version of a human ant hill. The only thing distinguishing Lemmon from the multitudes is his apartment, which the good ol' boy management staff like to use for their adulterous trysts, and which Lemmon himself never seems to need for the same purpose. He falls for elevator operator MacLaine, a brassy yet wistful cutie, who happens to be one of his boss's said trysts. Things get complicated as Lemmon has to decide which is more important to him: the moral high ground or climbing the corporate ladder.Lemmon essays a tricky role beautifully. I would have been instantly annoyed by this character had anyone else played him. It's hard to feel sorry for a doormat who can't say ""no,"" but Lemmon makes it virtually impossible not to like his character. MacLaine, too, delivers one of the best performances of her career, a rather ballsy one in a way, as she makes her elevator operator unsympathetic through much of the movie. This pair of unconventional actors creates a refreshingly bleak romance, if there can be such a thing. The only thing that seems to be preventing both of these characters from getting completely lost in the crush of indifferent humanity is their tenuous connection to one another.""The Apartment"" is a perfect New Year's Eve film. It superbly taps into that feeling of being lonely while surrounded by people that only those who live in big cities can understand. Anyone who's commuted to work on a subway or bus will instantly recognize the feeling this movie conveys.Grade: A"
"I wish I had come into this movie not knowing what happens, because I have a feeling I would have enjoyed it even more. As it was, I still loved it.The idea on which this movie is based is so clever, it's hard to understand why they hadn't made it before. A young man named C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) allows the executives of the company where he works to use his apartment for pleasure, usually with women other than their wives (figures). While this is going on, Baxter finds he is in love with a certain elevator girl at the company named Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). I'm going to go ahead and stop there so I don't ruin anything for you. The plot is too creative to waste in a comment.It is hard to pinpoint exactly why The Apartment succeeds so well. Perhaps it is because the characters ring so true. This is the first movie I've seen Jack Lemmon in, and I have to say I like him a lot. He manages to be funny without breaking away from his character, something I admire in the actors of the Golden Age and something the actors of this age need to learn. There was not a moment in this movie when I felt like Bud wasn't doing what he felt was the right thing. In fact it seems to me like this movie is about Bud and Fran discovering what ""the right thing"" actually is. Fran is played by Shirley MacLaine in what could have been an over-the-top, whiny performance. MacLaine manages to turn Fran into a wonderfully sympathetic and strong-willed woman, despite the fact that she's stuck on the wrong guy. Fred MacMurray has a nice turn as a man who never quite understands the girl he brings to Baxter's apartment, and ends up selfishly pushing her over the edge.Of course, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond have written such a witty and character-driven screenplay, it must've made the actors' jobs easy. This is more than just a comedy, and while at first glance it seems to be very simple, the more you think about it, the more you realize how much is really there."
"On March 27, 2002, as the world has sadly learned, filmmaker Billy Wilder passed away. No doubt, over the passing days, weeks, months and years, there will be some discussion about him and of his work. There will also be biographies, documentaries and other tributes to him. I believe, however, that he should be left to rest in peace and that the only true monument to him is in the great movies he left to us. One of these is 1960's `The Apartment'. Some might disagree with this film's Best Picture win (Considering that it was the same year as `Psycho', `Elmer Gantry' and `Spartacus'), but it's a great movie nonetheless.  Jack Lemmon, In a memorable role, portrays C.C Baxter, an insurance man for Consolidated Insurance in New York. Baxter has a secret: He has been lending the key to his apartment to various executives so they could have extra-martial affairs. In exchange, Baxter's career advances so far that by the movie's end, he is the boss's executive. Shirley MacLaine is elevator girl Fran Kubelik, who has had a romance with Baxter's boss. Even though the boss is a real weasel (More on him and the actor in the next paragraph), Kubelik thinks she still loves him at the end. However, she doesn't realize that she actually has fallen for Baxter.  Fred MacMurray will probably be most remembered for his role on `My Three Sons'. His early film career also involved largely comedic roles. Ironically, his most memorable film roles, like `Double Indemnity' and `The Caine Mutiny', had him adapt to villainous roles, which he did real well. Here, he portrays J.D Sheldrake, the personal manger at the Insurance company. He is a real liar, using people to get to the top (Where he is at) and having flings with others at the building. With his looks and smile, however, you would think that he could have easily played a good guy. Shows just how good of an actor he was (Or was the part just a good fit?). Unfortunately, he joined the ranks of actors who never won Oscars. 
Wilder's films had a common theme of people willing to do anything for happiness, even if it means breaking the law. Here, the story is about someone willing to give up his bachelor flat for a higher position at his job. In expense, he loses the trust of those around him. The main character here, like Walter Neff in `Double Indemnity' also have a similar flaw: They don't know what to do until it's too late and they never take a stand on something. Wilder's films also had great endings, often with dialogue. The final line in this film (`Shut up and deal!') has become nearly as famous as Nobody's Perfect'. Now that's movie making!  References to previous Wilder films made in this one:Mr. Dobisch (Ray Walston), one of the executives, remarks that he picked up a girl that looked like Marilyn Monroe, who was in  `The Seven Year Itch' and `Some Like It Hot'. During thr filming of those movies, Wilder had grown to despise Monroe's demands for star treatment and her poor work ethic. Thus, he also included the party-girl Monroe-esque character in this film.Another of the executives, Mr. Kirkeby (David Lewis), saw Baxter with Kubelik at his apartment and remarks that they had a `Lost Weekend', a possible reference to the 1945 film that won Wilder Best Director and Best Picture academy awards. The character name Sheldrake was also used in Sunset Blvd. (1950)."
"For some strange reason The Apartment seems to be billed as a comedy and although it does have some 'comedic' elements it is not a film that I would categorise as a comedy. Anyone expecting a silly bit of fun (along the lines of Some Like It Hot) is going to be in for a bit of a shock. The misleading way that this film is marketed isn't really the problem with this film though and for me the main problems run much deeper....For a start there are so many things in this film that seem a bit ridiculous and far-fetched that it's almost hard to know where to begin; I did find it difficult to believe that Baxter would go to such extreme lengths in order to try to advance his career (particularly at the beginning of the film where a promotion is based upon supposition rather than any firm guarantees). His passive nature is also hard to swallow and this passiveness does seem to get more and more ridiculous and hard to swallow as the film progresses. In fact much of it becomes so absurd that as a character I started to find his passiveness more infuriating than endearing. Another issue I had with Baxter's character, and to a certain extent, Wilder's script is that it felt as though we were meant to feel sorry for Baxter. In fairness this may have worked if Baxter would have just been some drip who everyone took advantage of and had nothing to gain from the situation, but Baxter does gain his promotion by letting his colleagues use his apartment for their lewd encounters meaning that Baxter is hardly a saint himself. The problem is that the script never highlights the fact that Baxter is guilty of 'wrongdoing' as much as his colleagues and this results in the audience being unable to judge him in the same way. If we stick with characters then it's also hard to get involved with a film where the characters can't be easily related to nor are they particularly sympathetic and sadly that's how I felt about virtually every character in this film. Going back to unrealistic scenarios and situations then you only need to look at the love triangle between Sheldrake, Fran and Baxter. We learn that Fran is in love with Sheldrake, but I couldn't really see any reason why she was in love with him? What did she like about? It could be his money or she could have found his power an aphrodisiac, but Fran didn't strike me as that sort of girl so her feelings for him genuinely left me puzzled. I also struggled understanding why both Baxter and Sheldrake were besotted with Fran? I mean there are 32,000 employees at their company, of which roughly half will be women and you're trying to tell me that she is the most attractive woman out of around 16,000 women???? Come on.... Even the attraction between Baxter and Fran (which admittedly is the most believable romance here) still seemed a bit unlikely; Baxter knowing intimate personal information about Fran made him look a bit creepy and a bit of a stalker and I'm sure that if a real life Fran encountered a real life Baxter in a similar situation that poor Baxter wouldn't have got that date. Likewise, Fran never really seemed that interested in Baxter and I could never really get to grips with why he was so obsessed with her? The trouble is that when I watch a film I believe in the characters and their romances and/or situations because I WANT to believe in them not because I'm TOLD to believe in them. The problem here is that I'm given no real reason to believe in anything here and I just found a lot of it to be too ridiculous to be taken seriously. The worst part about this film was Sheldrake's decision to actually leave his wife as this was the only strain of credibility left in his character!!!! Some of the performances in this film are good; Jack Lemmon's infectious energy is wonderful here and he really does get as much out of the role as he possibly could have done. MacMurray plays the slime-ball boss to perfection and MacLaine is OK, but does quite bring as much passion to the table as Lemmon or MacMurray. There are also some classic Wilder lines such as one of the girls (after spending the evening in Baxter's apartment) saying to one of Baxter's colleagues ""Do you mean you bring other girls up here?"" and Baxter's colleague replying ""Certainly not I'm a happily married man"".All told, The Apartment was a bit of a disappointment and considering the hype that surrounds it I honestly expected a better film than what I saw. Whilst it clearly means well I just found that it had too much working against it for me to be able to enjoy it as much as many others do. To end on a positive note, I did like the fact that both Baxter and Fran were able to see the 'bigger picture' by the end of the film."
