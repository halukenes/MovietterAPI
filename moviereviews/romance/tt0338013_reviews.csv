"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd. -- Alexander Pope==> I confess to being an idealist and a romantic. This type of film appeals to people like me... the ones who believe in love at first sight, soul mates, destiny, yada yada yada. The Charlie Kaufman penned 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is as fresh and original as some of his other screenplays (Being John Malkovich, Human Nature, Adaptation), but adds a romantic depth that makes this one of the most complete film going experiences I have ever had.There was an exchange during the film between our two leads, Joel and Clementine, played with poignancy and nuance by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, that echoed what I was feeling about the film.Clementine: This is it Joel. It's going to be gone soon.Joel: I know.Clementine: What do we do?Joel: Enjoy it.Luckily for me, I knew I was going to be able to revisit the film many times in my life. The depth of the film manifests itself in the fact that the soul mates, Joel and Clem, both know that their time is running out and that they will never be able to meet again.Most films might choose to highlight this type of heartbreak with the death of a loved one or a bittersweet farewell at a train station. But not Charlie Kaufman. He is bored by clich√©s. Rather, he chooses to dazzle us with the complexities of the human mind and all of its glorious possibilities. He is a master storyteller that is unlike any other I am aware of.Joel (Carrey) is socially inept. He has had girlfriends, but none that really meant anything. It is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. But, one day, he meets Clementine. ""Don't make any jokes about my name"", she warns him. She is wild and kooky, changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. She seems the polar opposite of Joel, but they click. They click in ways even they can't pinpoint. But from the moment they meet, they know there is something special there.However, after a silly argument breaks up their relationship, Clementine decides to visit Lacuna Inc., a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. She has decided to erase the memory of Joel. When Joel hears this from some friends, he angrily decides to do the same to Clementine, erasing her completely from his mind.The erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is ""technically brain damage"", according to the doctor. The bulk of the film takes place during the process, inside Joel's mind. The most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. Those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. But as the time rewinds, the memories get better. We travel backwards and watch Joel and Clem during their best moments, loving life and loving each other. As this happens, Joel desperately regrets his decision. He wants the inevitable erasure to stop, but he is completely powerless. Soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. The film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind.'Eternal Sunshine' is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed 'Human Nature'. He has a flare that accompanies Kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. This film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically, but the director never lets us get lost. We always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same.Jim Carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that I would have deemed impossible a decade ago. He is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks. He is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing, interesting and kind. He deserves tremendous praise for this role. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. She is easily one of the very best actresses we have. Here she plays against type, and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. Hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. It is easy to understand why Joel falls in love with Clementine.I think fans of Charlie Kaufman will be thrilled with this brilliant entry in to his collection. I think the film will appeal to those who loved the recent masterpiece 'Lost in Translation' or Tom Tykwer's recent beauty, 'Heaven'. It is a romantic fantasy with real emotions and real characters that will resonate with the viewer who isn't entirely closed to sentiment. When Clementine whispers ""Meet me in Montauk"" into Joel's ear... it's hard to hold back a tear.This will easily be one of the best films of 2004. It is the antithesis of the typical romantic Hollywood fare. I loved every minute of its refreshing originality. The film has passion and flare and brilliant wit, all framed by an intelligent script that deals in absurdity while managing to maintain an intimate realism. These characters feel real. You root for them. You want them to meet again and give it another chance. It is a film that will only get better over time, as our memory of it waxes and wanes its way into our hearts.TC CANDLER"
"""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" - Alexander PopeMichel Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very strange and remarkably tender experience, which I suppose is only to be expected from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the man behind ""Being John Malkovich.""The film was produced by Focus Features (""Lost in Translation,"" ""21 Grams""), a company which strives to offer original, quality films to the true cinema lovers. If the company keeps producing films this good, they may become hugely successful in the future, if not already.The previews portrayed the movie as a bouncy, cheery comedy in the vein of ""Adaptation,"" the last film written for the big screen by Charlie Kaufman, when it is really a tender movie about love and romance. This is Jim Carrey's best performance to date, and may open the eyes of his prejudiced haters who have only imagined him as Ace Ventura and a certain cable guy for his entire career. No snippy quotes, outrageous humor or bizarre antics in ""Sunshine"" -- Carrey plays a true, realistic, three-dimensional character named Joel Barrish, who plans to have memories of his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), erased by a new company called Lacuna, after he discovers that she herself has had the procedure performed only a week before. Joel meets with the company's founder, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and is informed that the procedure -- although ""technically"" brain damage -- is on par with a heavy night of drinking. ""Nothing you'll miss much,"" he is told, as he plunges into a bizarre world of long forgotten memories.The entire process of the operation is quite fascinating, really, if a bit reminiscent of an idea founded by none other than one of Kaufman's favorite writers, Philip K. Dick, who wrote the source short story for the Ah-nuld movie ""Total Recall."" All items relating to the person you want erased from your brain are assembled together, and the technicians at Lacuna (Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) then ""map"" an outline of your memories, which are supposedly stemmed together. I have my doubts about the seriousness and remote possibility of such a procedure being performed, and the explanation is quite simply utter bull, but we don't care because the entire erasing of Joel's memories serves as a backdrop for a deeper meaning: If you could forget about past romances, would you really want to? And if so, would you be willing to sacrifice all the good ones, along with the bad ones?The conclusion that ""Sunshine"" arrives at is, to be totally truthful, as honest as can be. During the procedure, Joel's subconscious realizes that it doesn't want to let go of its memories of Clementine, and so begins a strange labyrinth of fragmented memories, constantly changing surroundings, and mental materializations of Clementine. The movie is like a very bizarre dream, when you're trying to interact with people, but they're not responding, and you shout and try to get their attention but they don't seem to notice. Joel's entire odyssey of the interior of his mind makes ""Being John Malkovich"" look normal -- but as I didn't like ""Malkovich"" very much, and thought its strangeness was unjustified, it fits perfectly in ""Sunshine"" -- there are some great special effects, such as when Joel is wandering through his own memories, drifting in and out of sleep, hearing the voices of the technicians erasing his memories and watching as objects and areas around him vanish and deconstruct. It's so bizarre but yet also so beautiful. Gondry was a former music video director (his complete works are available on DVD) and he is the perfect candidate for this project, having worked with Kaufman before on the 2001 flop ""Human Nature."" It seems that he has finally found a unique directing style that ties in perfectly with the underlying themes of the movie.There is a very deep message in ""Sunshine,"" and it is arguably Kaufman's deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent. I saw two people leave the rather empty theater during the screening I attended. It tanked in the US and I predict it will do the same in the UK, which is a shame, because this is the smartest film of 2004 and has the most to say about our lives than any other film this year. While everyone flocks to see the new Denzel Washington action movie, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is forgotten, which is quite depressing -- people would rather spend their money on forgettable entertainment than view something unique that has something important at its core.I think what the movie finally asks us after its long, emotional journey, is would we want our own memories erased? And if so, what would the consequences be? A lesser film might examine this idea poorly -- ""Sunshine"" is not. It is perfect in almost every conceivable way, and anyone who complains that it is not original must be joking -- in my entire lifetime, this is one of the most unique film experiences I have ever had.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It's beautiful, it's bizarre, it's exceptional, it's funny, it's lovely, it's touching, it's witty, and it's one of the best movies I have ever seen."
"Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.The film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been ""Warts And All."""
"This movie gives us what we all secretly wish for-- a chance to forget something that's hurt us in the past. The viewer can almost live vicariously through the two dysfunctional characters that are remarkably just like ordinary people. The relationship problems are the same. The little fights and bickers are things we all can relate to. The acting was amazing- throughout the movie, I actually forgot that I was watching Mr. Ace Ventura himself. Carrey and Winslet pull off a great performance, both ditching the typecasts that they've been shackled with. Not only did the film give us the opportunity to see what it was like if painful memories were erased, but it also gave us the opportunity to see that everything deserves a second chance. The way it ends leaves the viewer to imagine how the characters' lives will end. The idealist may say that they lived happily ever after; the pessimist may say that they just reverted to disliking each other again. Either way, it leaves you to imagining your own ending; a characteristic many films leave out. Basically, this movie makes you think, ""What if...?"" It truly gives new meaning to the phrase ""You never know what you've got until it's gone."""
"Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of ""little"" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind). He understands, and perhaps likely experienced to a degree, what a relationship holds to- the truth, to understanding, and then when it ends, how out memory changes the relationship. Enter in the concept that makes 'Eternal Sunshine' something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson's character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you've loved. And sometimes, and to the behest of the assistants of Lacuna (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), Joel doesn't want them all to be erased.As I mentioned, the plot is non-linear, which could've gone the wrong way if not done with skill. With a film like 21 Grams, which has a talented director and cast, the non-linear structure isn't necessary. But it's an asset that the story doesn't start from A to Z. To assist Gondry with this, he has the extraordinary Ellen Kuras as DP and Vald√≠s √ìskarsd√≥ttir, an editor from Iceland. Their collaboration is crucial with Gondry and Kaufman (and co-writer Pierre Bismuth), as they bring all of these un-real images a real quality. Quite simply, there isn't a finer example of surrealism crossbred with realism in any other American film so far this year. The usage of lights, cuts, and with the kinds of special effects not expected (i.e. no CGI), add to the effect it has on a viewer. That the characters of Joel and Clementine are as enveloping as they are is also a credit to Kaufman.But then there's one more part that completes the success of the film - the acting. Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. He finds a balance from certain scenes in being like people we see everyday, feeling low, not much of interest, inward. And then when the memory erases begin, we get to see him act funny, but not like the kind of humor he brought with Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. This is Carrey knowing this character just well enough to play off his counterpart, played by Winslet. She, meanwhile, is perhaps at her best. Her character is eccentric, funny, insightful, and wanting. She pulls it off. As do the supporting actors.There's not much more I can say about this film, except to say that even after seeing it three times, I feel like I could watch it over and over and see a new shot, a new sequence, and new set of emotions tied to things. It's one of the great romantic dramedies of the decade."
"There's only one way to describe ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"": perfect. It's been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it's deeply touching.Charlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these original, flawless scripts? Finally there's someone who uses the possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being smart alec.Some say ""Eternal Sunshine..."" was over-directed. I disagree. Having read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird picture? Mind you, I'm not saying that lots of effects automatically make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to underline the story, not distracting from it.Jim Carrey... wow! I've always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he is, but I never thought that his performances in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man On The Moon"" were that much of a departure from his funny-man side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It's like Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I say!Finally I have to mention Beck's cover of ""Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime"", which fits perfectly into the movie and won't leave my CD-Player for the next months.A movie like ""Eternal Sunshine..."" really shows how much time and money Hollywood wastes on producing crap like ""Bad Boys"" or ""The Fast & The Furious"", and its box office result demonstrates how little people care about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again, because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each viewing. I can't wait until it's released on DVD.I feel the need to say more, but I can't put my feelings into (English) words. All I can say is: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it."
"After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with ""Human Nature"", Charlie Kaufman has teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy. With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn't go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant.""Eternal Sunshine"" centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy, mild mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty, impulsive girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to discover that she doesn't recognise him. He later finds out that the reason for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out completely. Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joel's distress, he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories of Clementine that he struggles to let go of.If anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this has got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend.Kaufman's story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too dissimilar from his earlier work, ""Being John Malkovich"". You have off the wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his journey in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufman's trademark, once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost In Translation"". Gondry's diection gives a bittersweet flavour to the tale.The sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best British actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.This is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy with a love story, then I suggest you see it. It's one of those films you'll want to see twice."
"It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love . If you haven't experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real 'love connection' per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can't be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is . utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.The story is a twisted and complicated tale from the same man who brought movie-going audiences such award-savvy features as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Joel Barish seems like the average, normal guy who stays pretty isolated from communicating his true feelings to others and yet reveals spectacular insight only to the confines of his journal. He doesn't like going on impulses and gut feelings but rather relies more on common sense and the logical sense of self-direction. That is until he meets Clementine. They flirt with each other and eventually find themselves falling in love with one another . That is until one day Joel finds out that Clementine has undergone a radical procedure to have him erased from her memory because she was unhappy. So, in an act of self-gratification, Joel decides to undergo the procedure himself, erasing every argument, every embarrassment, every thought he has had involving Clementine. But as the procedure goes on, Joel begins to realize that beyond the quarrels and the less flattering incidents there were beautiful memories that he never wants to forget. So he does the unthinkable . Joel attempts to outrun the erasers through a dizzying chase through his mind. The story for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is hauntingly brilliant and, in some cases, personally gratifying. The concepts and the feelings expressed behind the script of this film hit so hard to home that it feels as though we our seeing our own love lives played out on screen. Granted Sunshine does tend to veer off into the ridiculously absurd but when evaluating what one takes away from this film, it is pure genius.Quite amazingly this low budgeted independent feature showcases a surprising amount of A-list talent but manages to have those performers express well beyond their famous names. Jim Carrey, who has unsuccessfully attempted to make a mark in drama with lead performances in Man on the Moon and The Majestic, gives a thoroughly convincing and commanding performance in the role of Joel Barish. And Carrey's performance is only complimented by his interaction with Kate Winslet, who acts opposite of him as Clementine. Though the two give dramatically different personas to their characters and look as if they would never be quite compatible with each other based on surface actions, which is the idea the filmmakers are trying to express. It's not what is right in front of us that should define a relationship; it is the memories themselves and the experiences of the two individuals. Elijah Wood, in his first role outside the Lord of the Rings franchise which recently wrapped up in December, gives an effective performance as a man one can't help but despise for his methods of obtaining someone's affection but at the same time feel pity for his plight, which is that he feels love eludes him. And Kirsten Dunst performs well within the film despite her appearance that protrudes a sense of innocence that feels off-base or awkward that distracts from the actions of her character. Not to say that she doesn't perform well or that the character is a pointless one, not in the least, but perhaps it is the fact that her innocence, based on her name and the characters she has played, carries a stigma with her role.Overall, Sunshine, as awkward and thoroughly confusing at it may seem and is, manages to express, in the most informal of ways, the feelings and thoughts we should all have when examining a relationship, in that it is not the superficial features but the underlining memories that make it all worth while. When a relationship hits that unfortunate moment where it all seems to be breaking down, we, as human beings, seem to instantly draw ourselves to the negative aspects of that person, as Joel did early in the procedure, in an attempt of sorts to make everything right within our mind. What Eternal Sunshine successfully expresses is that when breaking down the relationship moment by moment, more often then not the happier events outweigh the bad and that should be our determining factor to keep the relationship going. Too many moments are wasted on gut-instincts and logic, when it comes to love one must live every moment for what it is because we only have one shot in this world and we might as well make it worthwhile. What happens if that relationship doesn't work? You pick yourself up, let the relationship go, and, in time, move on. If you try your best and nothing seems to work in that relationship then perhaps it will never work and you shouldn't play out a fantasy that you know will never be. We have all experienced moments where we feel as though there is opportunity to ask someone out or express how one feels for a certain individual but have chickened out due to nerves, 'gut-instincts', or views of superficial matters. Eternal Sunshine promotes the ideology of living within the present and letting the course of the matter play out as it may. If we all relied on nerves and logic, would anyone really fall in love?"
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the most well written movie since Pulp Fiction, and the best movie since the turn of the century. It's originality is unprecedented, putting screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) up there with the greats. And every time you watch it, you will gain a new understanding of the characters and story.Just imagine, instead of dealing with the pain and suffering of your past, you can erase people and moments from your memory, and move on with your life, without giving it another thought. Imagine your bad relationships can disappear. You bad experiences obliterated. Your bad times gone. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak makes this all possible.Meet Joel Barish (Carrey), an archetypal lost American, a passive soul wandering through his own life in a cloud of dissatisfaction. One day, his shyness and antisocial tendencies led him to meet the free spirit Clementine (Winslet), changing his life forever.They break up, and Clementine impulsively decides to ""erase"" Joel from her memory. Joel, upon hearing this, also signs up for the procedure. But midway through, he changes his mind. Then the chase begins, as Joel and Clementine try to outrun the erasers, hiding in his childhood and humiliation.Meanwhile, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo, the ones performing the procedure on Joel, have their own troubles with romance, memory erasure, and Clementine, all due to the procedure offered by Dr. Mierzwiak.Although Carrey spends most of the movie in an induced coma, his outstanding performance proves to us that his talents go far beyond his Ace Ventura days. And Winslet's spectacular performance didn't go unnoticed either, earning her another Oscar nod.To say the least, Eternal Sunshine will change your life. Kaufman shows us that you must take the good along with the bad, because if you forget, you are destined to repeat your mistakes. Joel doesn't realize he made a mistake until he gets past their bad moments, and remembers all the good times he and Clementine had together. This movie gives a new meaning to ""You never know what you've got until it's gone.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant work of originality. With all the crap Hollywood has been turning out in recent years, this will feel like a blast of fresh air. Kaufman's masterpiece is inspirational, and, unlike most Hollywood films, makes you think. It'll make you realize that at the end of the day, our memories are all we really have, and when they're gone, we're gone."
"If you can relate to the underlying theme of love longed for, love given and received, and love lost, this is a great film. If you have come to understand that acceptance can -sometimes- be a great thing and not a compromise or a 'settle for' - this is a moving film.As crazy and almost surreal as elements of this film are, it somehow remains honest and real. That seems like a contradiction... life is contradictory, isn't it?Carrey and Winslet both turn in superb performances, as do the supporting cast.  An incredible film that most of the people who 'get it' will love - but I suspect there will be more than a small percentage who won't understand it or can't relate to it and they will (understandably) dislike it."
"Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.What? Sci Fi? Well yes. A simple science fiction device, memory erasure, is the vehicle for this beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and directed love fable. The fact that this is a good film does not disqualify it from the sci fi genre. In fact, would-be sci fi writers and film-makers should take note of this.But Eternal Sunshine is a love story first and last, in all respects. The characters are what John Irving would call ""L.A. dysfunctional"", although they don't live in L.A. Carrey and Winslet are deeply insecure people with little going for them but good looks (which they try to disguise), fairly sweet dispositions, and a desire for companionship. They meet on Valentine's Day in Montauk, where they have both seemingly traveled 'on a lark', and the entire experience of the film seems to derail from this point forward. Chronological, linear story-telling becomes impossible because the characters are having their memories erased in order to assuage the pain of their separation. No spoilers, so let me stop right there.If I have made Eternal Sunshine seem like it might be too much of a challenge or too disturbing for an evening's light entertainment, be not afraid. Certainly there are occasional disturbing elements, and the characters themselves are all neurotic enough to have walked off the street and onto the screen. But the film is so artistically rendered, and so well thought-out that what could have been a nightmare really becomes a fantastic post-modern love fable. It's also one of those great films that becomes predictable after a while, but is so delightfully portrayed and satisfying that it does not matter.The acting is exceptionally good. I would expect nothing else from this cast. Winslet is especially remarkable for her ability to play a young North East American better than most American actresses could. How this genius has been passed up in each of her 4 Oscar nominations to date is inexplicable. Carrey's talent is undeniable, though I dislike many of the films he chooses to take on. His performance here is easily as good as his award-worthy performances in the Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and Man on the Moon.We spend a lot of time inside people's heads in this film, yet the camera never becomes a member of the cast as it does in films like ""Being John Malkovich"". I can pay no higher compliment to the production team. This is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it is done with flawless simplicity in Eternal Sunshine. This film has just joined Shakespeare in Love, Wild at Heart, and Brokeback Mountain among my favorite all-time love stories. This is the first Michel Gondry film I have seen. I am going to make sure it is not the last."
"Here's the basic plot. Clemintine and Joel have a long, rocky relationship. Clemintine decides to get Joel erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same, only while Joel is in the process of the erasing, he comes back around to the really sweet, nice memories, and realizes that he wants out of the procedure. Now here's what I thought about it. This movie is completely amazing. Totally original story and wonderful directing. Some of the best directing that i've seen in any movie. Some of the best original music too. This is in my top five favorites, and it also boosted Jim Carrey into one of my favorite actors. You know you have a good movie on your hands when the next day you're still thinking about parts of it, and you want to see those parts again. If you haven't seen this, I recommend that you check it out. It's different, in a really good way. There's not much more to tell you about it. If you want to see the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey, than you should absolutely skip this one. But if you want to see a side of him and Kate Winslet that you've never seen, or if you want to see a total original movie with wonderful cinematography and really great music, then by all means, you should absolutely see this one!"
"Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Well, if you're familiar with Kaufman's work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself ""What the hell is going on?"", but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I'm glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel's head.If you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.But if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that's beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he's smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you with it's originality and it's poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.Michel Gondry's use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers. Eternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of ""Best of 2004""."
"this is my favorite movie of 2004 and definitely one of the top in my all-time favorite lists! Eternal touched a certain part of you, your heart that most shows never did. or rather could never did. it shows the fragility of a relationship. people want to erase bad memories of a failed relationship yet at the same time, cant bear to part with the good ones! how so can that be done? how can you erase bad memories and saved good ones only? Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and Clementine respectively. Arguably one of their career best so far. its a pleasant surprise to see the man behind ""The Mask"" playing such a quiet and introvert role. Kate, on the other hand, brought Clementine to new heights as the bubbly and brutally honest lass who you love and hate.Eternal is a definite marvel, a feat in itself. its rich and flamboyant yet fragile. it brings the audience to such a personal level it hurts. especially when both cant seem to escape from the erasure.well-done!"
"""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned."" - Alexander Pope Is ignorance truly bliss? And if you could erase a person, what would the consequences be? ""Eternal Sunshine"" answers these questions, in a way that most Hollywood movies could not. Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have created one of the most original, touching, funny, and unique films of recent years. It explores the mind and the heart, deeper than other movies have dared to do.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is on the shy side. He's rather quiet and ordinary. Joel is stuck in life; he has no real relationships, a job he hates, and doesn't know where he's going or what he wants, but is too nervous to break out of his niche. Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) seems like his complete opposite. She's spontaneous, wild, and eccentric. Her hair changes from red to blue to orange to green, depending on her mood. Clementine doesn't care what people think, and is free and impulsive, doing and saying what she wants.Clementine and Joel have a wonderful relationship, then break up because of petty arguments and irritations about each other's personalities. Joel tries to talk to her, then discovers she has had her memories of him wiped, by a company named Lacuna, that specializes in removing unwanted memories. Angry and hurt, he decides to undergo the procedure himself, confident he'll never miss Clementine. As the various memories are erased, Joel sees their best and their worst moments together. They argued and fought, but they were also happy, and for a time, they really loved each other. He realizes he'd rather have the pain of their relationship than have no memory of her at all. He begins to regret his decision, and desperately tries to stop the procedure. The film focuses on Joel's attempts to hide Clementine in his mind, and his struggle to fight the process.Jim Carrey's performance is wonderful, a complete change from his usual antics. He is sympathetic and believable; the rubber face that is usually contorted in a silly grin is subtly controlled, every line and expression honest and real. He is becoming a gifted actor and hopefully the public will forget the Ace Ventura side of him. Kate Winslet, who is one of our greatest actresses, gives one of her best performances. She gives a complexity to her role, which could have easily been clich√©d and simple. She shows Clementine's want for attention, but also her incredible loneliness. Both of these characters aren't perfect; there are times when you understand why they dumped each other, and fought. But you also see why one loved the other. The supporting cast of Wilkinson, Wood, Dunst, and Ruffalo hold their own, as the eccentric team who run Lacuna, and have their own opinions about the process.People have called this an ""anti-romance"" movie, but I don't feel that. I think it is the ultimate romance movie, for it shows the complexity and pain of love. How much it hurts when it's gone, and how wonderful it feels while it's happening. ""Eternal Sunshine"" explores the mind with an intensity that is both painful and eloquent at the same time, like love itself.This film will make you reconsider your opinions about many things: life, love and memories. Gondry has brilliantly made it confusing and fast, yet clear and profound at the same time. The film is delicate and soft, but it hits you right in your heart. This is definitely a movie everyone should see. Because if they did, love would never be the same again."
"There's absolutely no way I can write about this film without a spoiler, as I think, judging from the comments written up on this site, many seem to have difficulty following the plot. As a general guide, if you're having difficulty following the chronological order of the scenes, it's necessary to follow the changes in color of Clementine's (Kate Winslet) hair. It starts off green, then changes to orange and finally finishes up blue. In the film though, it starts off blue, then goes to orange (the predominant color), then green and then back to blue.I must say I watched the film with a certain level of discomfort, being constantly reminded of my own break-up. This wasn't helped by my feeling that the Joel character (Jim Carrey) was very similar to myself. The film challenged me to re-evaluate many of the memories I have which I'd purposely buried. This is the dominant theme of the film: our memories and our relationship to them.The film starts as Joel wakes up one morning feeling awful. It's Valentine's day (his comments about which remind me of things I myself have said). His day simply improves when he discovers someone's smashed in the side of his car, and by the time he gets to the train station he's in such a funk that instead of going to work he impulsively jumps on a train to Montau and later calls in sick. But there he meets someone and they click.Although we've already seen 15 minutes of the movie, it's at this point that the credits kick in and we watch Joel driving alone in anguish. It soon becomes apparent that Joel and Clementine have just split. Joel is driving home to forget about Clementine forever. He's told by his friends that Clementine's just had him permanently erased from her memory, (a new service offered by a company called Lacuna). So Joel volunteers himself. The company offers to wipe his mind in the comfort of his own home, but during the process Joel in a dreamlike state gets to visit all the recesses of his own memory. At first all we see between the couple is the senseless bickering and the ghastly fights that led up to the breakdown. But then he suddenly comes across a forgotten memory where the couple shared a single tender moment and he remembers his love for her. At this point he starts fighting to save the moment. He tries a number of different stratagems, such as trying to wake himself up, and associating her with memories from his childhood. At first he has some success, but when the ""erasure men"" hunt down even these memories he's forced to find ever more buried and ever deeper parts of his subconsciousness. But even in the parts of his memory that Joel has almost forgotten himself, the memory of Clementine is systematically rooted out and destroyed.Most poignant for me is probably the way the film portrays our desire to forget, so that we can block out the mind-numbing pain. When Joel is told to collect together all the things that may remind him of Clementine, he collects together two black bin liners full of stuff; I remember the ambivalence I felt to many of the things I myself once had (and coincidentally I also have a photograph from when my ex was about 8). Another point which touched me was the portrayal of the Eakin's (the mutual friends of Joel and Clementine who'd introduced them.) We see them arguing openly in front of their friends, slowly destroying their own marriage, which in the light of what's happened between Joel and Clementine looks like infinite folly. The film clearly shows the way in which we tend to ignore and take for granted the love we have for our partners and then how we often only realize after being rudely reminded by the pain of separation.The final scene is when both Joel and Clementine have found out that they had once been lovers. Joel is sitting at home and listening to the tape from his case file. Clementine, on hearing some of the mean things that Joel had told the ""doctors"" about her, runs away. Joel runs after her and begs her to stay. This is juxtaposed with their real first meeting where the roles were reversed and Joel was the one to chicken out. The relationship starts anew.Jim Carrey's performance was absolutely stunning. I would never have dreamed that he could play a shy, reserved and introverted man with both subtlety and compassion."
"Its a splendid movie all round. To me, it is indeed the finest work of cinema art. It tickles your curiosity throughout and doesn't falter at the end. In a nutshell, if you don't find this movie as being a masterpiece, you're either stupid or dead inside, there is no other way to put it.
""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd"""
"That is the question underlying this entire movie, since two-thirds of it is the process of elimination of a man's memories in order to forget the person who caused him some hurt in the recent past.This man is Joel Parish, played (or underplayed) by Jim Carrey who on a train ride to Long Island meets Clementine Krucyzinski (Kate Winslet). Both strike up an uneasy conversation: she being brash, aggressive, he being almost demure. There seems to be something there lingering between them, some connection even when they're totally different, and later we learn, when their affair ends, that she has decided to erase her memories of him and move on, which prompts Joel to do the same.Except he decides he doesn't want to at the last minute.So begins a roller-coaster ride where he tries to salvage anything he can as one by one his memories are being zapped away from him, and to see how he goes from one to the other, often with the surreal assistance of Winslet herself (as she is an integral part of his memories), we definitely get bombarded with frenetic images of Joel's mind literally coming apart at the seams, but we never forget that this is his heart that we're talking about, and in a small performance, Kirsten Dunst reveals just how heartless the procedure can be in a revelatory moment, one that makes us totally root for this odd couple right down to the last scene. One of the most original stories which hit theatres in 2004 and which deservedly won its Best Original Screenplay Oscar even if it lost in acting categories, this is the Movie of 2004."
"I had no idea what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was about until the end of March. I had heard some small rumblings about it around the Internet for a few months, and also saw a few short TV trailers for it, but that was about it. Basically, all I knew was it was another dramatic Jim Carrey film, written by the same guy who wrote two of the weirdest and somehow great films to come out in a long time, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. But does this film succeed to be just as weird yet excellent as the other two? Or is it even better? A big yes on both counts would be highly appropriate.The film's main protagonist is Joel (Jim Carrey). He was in a relationship with the very free-spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet), but slowly, they began to pull apart. So, the very impulsive Clementine decides to have a wicked new procedure done to herself in which every memory of Joel is erased from her brain. Of course, Joel fails to find out right away, and only thinks upon various attempts to try to speak to her that she is simply just completely ignoring him. That is until, he finds out about the procedure from friends who were supposed to be keeping it a secret.The company performing the procedures is called Lacuna Inc. Upon heading to Lacuna for answers, Joel finds out from the head doctor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), that he cannot be given any whatsoever, as everything is confidential. The Doctor does however, tell Joel the details of the procedure that Clementine had. After some passing time, Joel decides to have the operation done to him, on the night before Valentine's Day. So Joel goes home that night, takes the special pills given to him and falls asleep on his bed. It is then that Mierzwiak's assistants at Lacuna enter in to perform the procedure.What follows from here, is a seamless blend of both memories of Clementine and Joel within Joel's head, and the real world where Patrick, Stan and Mary (Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst respectively) are performing the procedure on Joel, as well as doing random things around his house. Only everything doesn't go so sweet. After the procedure's initial reactions begin to set in, Joel isn't as enthusiastic as he once was about having it done. So he begins to try to fight off the erasure. This begins to complicate things for the assistants working on him and serves for the main basis of where the film goes from that point.Despite how complicated and bizarre the film may sound, it still is a great and maybe even brilliant film. All the actors shine brightly in their performances, especially Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. I don't think I've ever seen these two as good as they are in this, both within and outside Joel's head. Their chemistry and romance comes off very well on screen as well as being very believable. The writing is also just as good, if not even better. It must take quite the effort to continue to write films such as these, but the writer, Charlie Kaufman, is seemingly getting better and better with his scripts. By the same token, the scripts are getting stranger and stranger.The editing and look of the film is very well done as well. The film is quite jumpy in many instances, looping back and forth from activity in Joel's brain to the real world outside of it. The way the imagery is shown is quite stylish, and truly shows the complete agonizing nightmare Joel is going through. It is evident that a great deal of time was spent on the final product of the film both by the editors and the director, Michel Gondry. Although Gondry hasn't had a hit film as of yet, he does show off his excellent film-making skills with this film. Hopefully, this director will continue to excel with films like these and become much more mainstream as the years go on.I have nothing but praise for the film. It is definitely a must see. The complete brilliance of every aspect of the film is far superior to many of the ""hit mainstream"" films being released in theatres these days. It can even be considered as a very early candidate for the best picture of the year. If you have the chance to see it, this film is not to be missed.10/10."
"This was hands down the best movie of 2004. I wish it had come out later in the year so Kate Winslet would have won the Oscar she so dearly deserves. One of the reasons I loved this movie was because of the wonderful role reversal. Jim Carrey, whose comic performances have been lauded and dramatic roles almost universally reviled by critics, is superb as the normal, every-man Joel. Kate, who almost always plays the uptight proper lady, is hilarious and heartbreakingly too real as the quirky, emotionally disturbed Clementine. The words that come out of her mouth make you laugh, cry and go into shock all at the same time.The basic premise of this story is about a recently parted couple, Joel and Clementine, who were polar opposites. Joel comes to realize that in order to move on with her life, Clementine has undergone a new radical procedure that erased all memories of her relationship with him. Joel is horrified and curious at the same time and decides to seek out the doctor for his own experiment. Only once the procedure has begun, he decides (too late!) that although those memories hurt, they are his memories and he is better for having them.The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Tom Wilkinson, who has never given a bad performance, does not disappoint here as the doctor performing the memory-erasing procedures. While it would have been easy for this character to be one note, Tom breathes life and his own story line into him. Kirsten Dunst shows depth rarely seen before as Mary, a receptionist in the doctor's office. Elijah Wood is stuck in a pretty thankless role as a technician who performs the procedure. Mark Ruffalo, another technician, takes his character to another level with his relationship with Mary and proves once again that he is an amazing supporting actor.This movie is very big on psychedelic special effects, but the moral is completely real. I would recommend this to anyone in any walk of life."
"This movie is a deep dark look at loss and regret, and the desire to forget forever the things that cause us deep emotional anguish. Jim and Kate play a couple that had a rough break up, despite the fact that they were deeply in love. Jim goes to a company that will come into your house, and while you sleep seek out and destroy painful memories. What makes this interesting, well there are many things that make this movie interesting, but what really stands out is the way that Jim's character struggles within himself to hold on to the memories he so wanted erased initially. This movie is a sobering look at the thing that makes us what we are, our choices and the pain or reward that they bring. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do a phenomenal job in this movie."
"Though I'd heard of this movie for a very long time, I just watched it recently. And honestly, I've been asking myself ever since why I hadn't done it sooner. It's such a beautiful and remarkable romantic screenplay that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone around me.This movie is all about one thing and one thing alone: love in its purest meaning. The story has no more nor less than what any of us has been living in our couple's everyday life. Joel is an ordinary guy with a very normal (not to say boring) life, nothing had seemed to be much alive until the day he met Clementine. She, on the other hand, is an unconventional girl who changes her hair color depending on her mood at the moment. Like two opposite poles of a magnet, they fell for each other right away. And like every ordinary couple, they enjoyed their time together, they had fun together, but they also fought. As they are so different, they fought a lot. Though all those fights have never made them stop loving each other, one time, they fought so badly for some stupid reason that they decided to do something terrible that they've both regretted ever since: they went to Lacuna Inc. - a company specialized in wiping away customer's undesired memories... The erasing is an all night process of mapping and killing of the target memories. And here what's made this movie so special: almost the entire love story was told inside Joel's mind while we were walked through all the key memories of their relationship, just before every of them faded away into nothing during the erasing process.It started with the most recent ones - their biggest stupid fight and some another before it, in which Clementine and Joel looked like 2 miserable persons who don't fit together and all they've been doing is to make the other suffer. But as we traveled backward, the memories got better and better. Witnessing the very same couple in their best moment, seeing how deeply they love each other, we finally understood why they were together at the first place. And that's also the time when Joel realized how much those memories mean to him and began to regret his impulsive decision. So he hopelessly tried every single thing he could think of in order to save all the memories he had left of Clementine, but it's too late... It's thrilling watching all those desperate attempts of Joel's mind, the movie showed us how amazingly our brain functions in creating new memory by mixing existing ones. Yes, remember when Joel tried to hide Clementine in some of his childhood memories? He was creating a new memory of her! But sadly, even this new one couldn't escape the erasure. As the process went on, no matter how hard Joel tried, his memories of Clementine continued to disappear one by one, until there was nothing left of her...""[...]
Clementine: This is it Joel. It's going to be gone soon.Joel: I know.Clementine: What do we do?Joel: Enjoy it.
[...]""Facing the inevitable forgetting - the fact that they will be gone forever from each other's memory, they just enjoyed their last moment together.The reason why I've placed this movie at the number one of its genre (romance) is because what it delivered is love in its true form, no more no less. No shiny romantic scene, no ""the 2 of us against the world"" situation, no drama with a lot of tears... It's just love, in normal life, of 2 very ordinary person, but brought to us in the most fascinating way! Following the whole erasure process, then seeing them falling for each other again as 2 complete strangers, that's made me realize how strong love can be. Even though all the memories were erased, the emotions, the feelings they'd had for each other are still there, buried deep down in their heart and mind, just waiting for the day they met again to come out...And at the end, when they both learned about the truth, about all the heartbreaking things they'd done to each other:""[...]
Joel: I can't see anything that I don't like about you.Clementine: But you will! But you will. You know, you will think of things. And I'll get bored with you and feel trapped because that's what happens with me.Joel: ... Okay.Clementine: ... Okay.
[...]""Then they laughed and cried, and they're together again.
Yes, that's what love is all about."
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an inexhaustible serum formulated by lofty doses of trepidation. The film takes a similair high-octane approach within fetching out its countless events to that of one of my all-time favorites, Requiem for a Dream, making just about every conceptual message it has in store function freakishly well. Charlie Kaufman's script is the key module to this movie's heart-rending brain cluster that is surely guaranteed to tumble over and cause any other romantic narrative to look puny in comparison. (Verdict: A)"
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an eccentric love story between two different people who initially have a great relationship but it goes sour when realizing their extremely opposite personalities. They try to erase each other from their memories, but in doing so, realize what they had and how important it is to keep those special moments. This film shows how love makes us do silly things and how powerful it can be when two people share that affection. The film takes place during the winter in New York, where the cold weather can either make you feel like searching for warmth in someone's arms or it can make you feel lonely. Jim Carrey as Joel does an amazing job at interpreting a timid and introvert character while Kate Winslet, as Clementine, plays a spontaneous and energetic woman whose personality can go to either extreme in less than a second. The choice of slow and melancholy music helps portray these emotions throughout the movie as it takes us through the different memories they once shared. Most of the movie consists of several soliloquies where Jim Carrey, or Joel, exposes his inner most thoughts about a certain someone or something but does the opposite when Clementine is around. The dialog shared between the two also molds their characters and shows how distinct they are, and how their opposite personalities are what attract them."
"ETERNAL SUNSHINE's narrative is essentially a love story told backwards. It deals with the traditional problem of reverse narrative in a new way. The traditional problem is that if the audience already knows the ending (bitter breakup), then telling the story in reverse asks the audience the question of ""is it worth it?"" as we watch the story back to the beginning (falling in love). This intellectualizes the experience rather than giving us dramatic action. ETERNAL SUNSHINE deals with this problem of intellectualization by giving the protagonist an active role in the reverse narrative. Joel is able to interact with his old memories to try to stop the process of erasing; this attempt to escape is the major sub- plot of the film. The catharsis of the audience comes with his rediscovery of his love for Clementine as they try to escape together. They fail to escape at the climax of this sub-plot and his memory is erased. But the lovers meet again by fate and once again fall in love. This fake climax of the main love-story plot is placed at the beginning of the film and again at the end of the film ‚Äì the audience realizes the despite losing all their memory, the lovers meet and fall in love again. If the film ended there, it would have been a good film, and the central idea would have been ""Love happens because of fate"". But the problem would have been that Joel went through this huge journey of discovery and change but that all seems to go to waste if fate was just going to put them together again ‚Äì he needs to be the one making an active choice that demonstrates his internal change at climax. The real climax of ETERNAL SUNSHINE comes out of the reversal at the end, in which the Joel and Clementine discover their bitter past and must choose whether or not to commit despite their past. This resurfaces Joel's inner journey. He and she choose to commit, completing Joel's journey of internal change with an external action. The central idea now becomes ""Love happens because of fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love"". This real climax fueled by true character change, dilemma and choice is what makes the film great. The climax completes the audience catharsis experienced through Joel's rediscovery of love; as a result he wins the girl and we are touched by a great story.My Story Chart of this movie is at storycharts.ca"
"This film has both Jim Carrey and Kate Winsett playing roles that you are probably unaccustomed to seeing them in. Jim Carrey plays plain-vanilla introvert Joel and Winsett plays extroverted salesgirl Clementine who likes to express herself by dying her hair an odd combination of colors and dressing up potatoes like Barbie Dolls. At the time he meets Clementine, Joel is living with someone named Naomi that he mentions several times during the film in only positive terms as ""very nice"". Joel must be searching for something other than ""very nice"" since this doesn't prevent him from throwing over this woman that the audience never sees for the unpredictable unknown quantity, Clementine. However, eventually the relationship ends so badly for this mismatched couple that Clementine has all memory of their relationship erased from her mind by a company that has the technology to provide such a service.When Joel discovers what she has done he is so hurt that he wants the same thing done to him so that he can erase the pain. The process takes an entire night, and during this process Joel relives all of the moments he and Clementine had together and realizes that Clementine brought enough happiness into his life that he doesn't want her erased from his mind after all. However, he is now unconscious and unable to communicate his wishes to those handling the procedure. Thus, he tells Clementine - inside his mind - what is going on and they attempt to hide from the ""mind erasers"" in places in his memories where he would have never taken her. Specifically, he takes her to particularly humiliating points in his childhood and adolescence. It seems telling that the pair have been together for two years yet Joel has apparently never told Clementine about any of these memories, apparently having shut her out of selective portions of his life. However, these evasion tactics are no match for the mind-erasing team of Lacuna Inc., and ultimately Clementine is cleansed from Joel's mind. Just before the last memory of her is erased, she tells Joel to meet her in a particular spot that was special to both of them. The next day he awakes, is drawn to this prearranged meeting place for reasons he doesn't understand, and she is there. Neither one of them knows who the other is, but the relationship is beginning to start all over again when a disgruntled Lacuna employee gives them their files, which include tapes of what both Joel and Clementine thought of one another at the the time each requested to have the other erased. They listen to each others tapes and are both shocked and embarrassed. These are not flattering revelations, to say the least. Will they decide to part before all of these awful things start happening all over again, or will they take a chance? Watch and find out.The plot may be hard to follow as it bends back and forth through time, but it is worth it, and Jim Carrey gives the best performance he has given since ""The Truman Show"". The movie has a lot to say about how we are the product of our memories and our choices - both the bad and the good. It also illustrates how absolute power corrupts through the unconscionable actions of some of the employees of Lacuna Inc. who start out helping people and end up helping themselves. You'll find yourself catching something you missed before each time you watch it. I highly recommend this film."
"Despite my desire to enjoy what I hoped would be a unique film, I found it dark and self indulgent.  The superb acting couldn't overcome a script that is centered on a failed relationship that never makes sense to the viewer or to the lovers.  In the end you feel like this is ""Adaptation II"" - yet another film about a brooding self-centered guy who can't really relate to anyone beyond his own fantasy life.  The dramatic device ultimately used in the film of having the main character fight to preserve his memory fails because it comes across as a clever but unsatisfying rendition of psychotherapy.  The subplot is banal and adolescent.  In many ways this entire film comes across as something that was done back in the 60's, but which now falls flat."
"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is a love story about two lovers who undergo a procedure to erase each other from one another's memories, but when they meet after their memory is gone, there is something strange still drawing them together and it is also during that memory wipe that they realize how precious their relationship really was.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those films where you have to pay close attention to the scenes and dialog because even the smallest bit of dialog is important in this film. Because otherwise you will be confused in your initial viewing and will soon be asking yourself what in the world is going on. This film requires close attention in the initial viewing or multiple viewings in order to fully understand it and appreciate it for what it truly is.The film is not your basic love story, it is unique and sort of bizarre at the same time, and while it is not a suspense movie, it is filled with several shocking moments and twists, which will only increase your interest in the movie and the more you will be intrigued by it. The narrative part of the love story is also told in a reverse chronological order, which starts from the moment the lovers broke up and ends when they first met. While the present scenes are told in a normal order, the film constantantly switches back and forth between the two which may create some confusion, another one of the reasons that this film requires close attention, at first you will probably be confused about what you are seeing is the present or the past, but as the film will progress you will be able to tell them apart. The way the Narrative is similar to Mememto which also followed a reverse chronological order of storytelling. The storytelling is clever and interesting and only makes the film better and it's twists more shocking and intriguing. Acting wise, Jim Carrey is in Truman Show mode, or probably the most serious he has ever been in a film, this is probably the most serious role he has ever done, and he shines in his role as Joel Barish and is completely into his character. Kate Winslet also performs excellently well, and her character development in both the dream sequence and the present sequence is done extremely well. The supporting cast did not get that much screen time but they are performed their roles well, Kirsten Durst and Mark Ruffalo are good but the scenes between them in the apartment are kind of drawn out and I could have done without a few of them, but Elijah Wood is really great in his role as Patrick and scenes between him and Clementine are also interesting. The ending is also great because it leaves it completely up to the viewer to interpret what will happen next and the events that led up to the ending were also very interesting and intriguing. The soundtrack is also great and suits most of the scenes it is being played in, the opening and closing credits song is also fantastic and also wonderfully portrays the relationship between Clementine and Joel. The ice setting was not something i was fond of before watching the film but it is handled extremely well here, with the scene of Clementine and Joel laying on ice being one of the most touching and memorable moments of this film.Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a touching, in-depth and intriguing love story with such great plot, settings, performances and memorable moments that I can watch this film over and over again and never get bored. However you may need to watch this film multiple times to fully understand it's plot and the message it is trying to convey and appreciate it for what it truly is.Rating: 9.5/10"
"(Spoiled...) Like the rest of Kaufman's self-absorbed hallucinations, Eternal Sunshine fails to jump the ""who cares"" hurdle. What an overwrought mess of a movie. As far as that mind-surgery-memory-deleting helmet goes, why in tarnation was Jim Carrey's character--a self-described uninteresting bore--so very talented at resisting the program? No mental giant, he would have succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film. Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang of assistants who are giggling morons. What a sad, confused, irrelevant film. I was reminded more than once of the forgotten French mind-game films of the sixties. Marienbad, anyone?"
"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADI was expecting a great movie when I take it. But after 30 minutes watching it I realized that it would be a waste of time.The idea is interesting, explore the possibility of erasing someone from you mind gives you a wide range of paths to follow to create interest, climax, and sympathy to the main characters. This is not what happens in this movie. The plot is weak, the entire movie is spent to show how he tries to hide his girlfriend in his memory in a very boring way. The memories were not fun, not interesting, and added nothing to the history.They could have made a much better movie if the history was a comedy, but unfortunately they have chosen a ""drama"" (supposing it can be classified like this) which makes the watcher expects for its end. Even those romantic comedies are better than this because at least you want the couple to end the history together."
"This is the filmic equivalent of being stuck in a room with someone who thinks they have the most emotionally upsetting life imaginable and is doing everything in their power to persuade you they are truly tortured and pitiable. By the end of both experiences you just want to go home and feel utterly relieved you aren't so arrogant. Or you wish you were able to erase your own memory. (Sorry, a cheap film tie-in metaphor already.)The film itself, like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation suffers from a hole in the centre. Charlie Kauffman seems to think it is clever to take a totally unlikely scenario and then develop it into a ""quirky"" film that is supposed to make little sense. In each instance he fails to grasp that you can't just take a scenario so utterly implausible as to defy any audience to relate or respond to it. Eternal Sunshine is a slightly easier premise to connect with than Being John Malkovich, after all who hasn't wondered what it would be like to erase painful relationships. However Kauffman sems to mistake nonsense for emotional and intellectual depth.Someone told me that you have to watch Eternal Sunshine more than once to 'get it' and I promise that this isn't true. There is nothing you get the second time that you won't have got the first time. It is a fairly straight forward film. The only problem you might have is if you are colour blind and can't work out the time scale of the film from Kate Winslett's hair because you cannot tell that it is changing colour. The director might as well have put subtitles across the bottom of the screen saying ""Two years ago"" ""Present day"" because Gondry's visual 'clues' were about as subtle or 'clue-like' as subtitles.Performance wise, Kate Winslett was her usual self, and Jim Carrey was in Truman show mode. Carrey offers ocassional glimpses of acting talent before they are devoured by his all consuming gurning. Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst offer more respectable performances, however I felt cheated that their entire sub plot was clearly lying on the editing room floor, it felt rushed and unconvincing. Which is a shame because the rest of the film felt over long and over laboured and perhaps a better balance might have saved my cinema ticket which I spent the whole film folding into a variety of shapes.
I made a square (Not too difficult) a triangle. I tried to make a swan but it ended up looking like some sort of half eaten fish. After that I was running out of ideas and so i tore it into equal pieces. Then unequal ones. Bored yet? I was. The second time I saw it was even worse. Fortunately I had just seen 3-4x Jugatsu and so had something to concentrate on. Namely trying to understand a film which actually had some sort of emotional depth, some sort of conflicting plot and some semblance of lead performances.
I wish people wouldn't think that any film which doesn't have a discernable Beginning - middle - end structure automatically qualifies as intelligent or engaging. And that just because Jim Carrey isn't smacking himself in the face or making chimp noises he is acting. He isn't. He is just biding his time until he can start hitting himself in the face again."
"Now... those of you who haven't seen this, would probably go in to this movie with extremely high standards, and I don't blame you. This movie has seriously been recommended, and welcomed by critics. After seeing it for the first time, I understand why.Charlie Kauffman is known for his ""Out-Of-The-Ordinary"" scripts, and this is no exception. However Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind has something a little extra, something special, and as soon as it starts, you'll know it. What's amazing is that he captures what every true love story has, into one relationship... that of Joel and Clementine's. The idea of having one person in the world for everyone is supported.The acting is superb, both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet do an excellent job of pulling their weight. They are able to truly become their characters... who in reality, are complete opposites of the two in real life. Jim usually plays the overtly open character, bad mouthing everyone he's p***ed of at. Kate, usually playing the more ""innocent-type"" characters, damsels in distress, things like that. The two deliver, and I couldn't have imagined anyone else in the roles of Clementine and Joel. I truly believe there are Oscar noms. hiding in this movie for the two leads.The plot of this movie is very unique, very different. Now although going to get parts of your memory erased may seem corny at first, it truly shows the fact that are brains are misunderstood parts of our body, and no matter how hard we try to forget something, it will always find it's way back to us.The ending makes perfect sense, and while being tastefully done, it doesn't ruin the movie in any shape or form. While it is not one of those completely open-ended endings, some things are still left out in the air, to think about ourselves, and those are always more fun.Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, is one of those things that if you never take the time to sit down and watch this remarkable film, you'll end up regretting it for the rest of your life. And after you finally do watch it, I honestly think, you wouldn't want to erase the memory of this movie, even if you had the chance.""How Happy Is The Blameless Vestal's Lot, The World Forgetting, By The World Forgot. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Each Prayer Accepted, Each Wish Resigned."" ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" 9.895/10*****"
"I think it goes without saying amongst fellow film aficionados, that we all love films, especially the great ones. However over the years watching films I've noticed there seems to be that one film that is hugely popular, but when you sit down to watch it, you can't understand why it's held in such high regard. For me it's only happened a couple of times, but I unfortunately have to add Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to the list.Whilst I appreciated the original screenplay from Charlie Kaufman(whose work I usually love), it felt completely flat. I was never engaged at any moment in the film, the characters were extremely unlikable and had horrible personalities. Other then one emotional scene towards the end with Kirsten Dunst's character, the film felt dull and lifeless. At no point did I feel invested in the story. I was unable to buy into Joel(Jim Carrey) and Clementine's(Kate Winslet) impromptu relationship, which dissolved just as quickly as it began, giving me no time with their characters to care about their eventual fate.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give excellent performances, as do the entire cast. I just disliked their characters. The technical aspects of the film were well done. The way the film showcases memories, and the way they subsequently disappeared/folded into each other was expertly crafted and brilliantly edited. The only issue is the story and the characters didn't work for me. No matter how good the direction and editing is, the majority of the the time a film lives or dies by the strength of it's story and it's characters, and here it ultimately failed."
"My daughter loaned me this movie two weeks ago and I finally tried to watch it last night. I'll admit that I am not a big Jim Carey fan, but he does alright in some films, The Truman Show and Liar, Liar are two that I enjoyed. What I didn't like is that I found nobody in this film that I liked. There wasn't a single character that was somebody I felt I'd like to meet. Some of the scenes seemed either badly acted or badly written, or both. The scene when Joel first met Clementine on the train seemed like it was written by middle school wannabe writers. The ridiculous scenes inside Joel's apartment while his memories of Clementine were being erased seemed like something out of a bad seventies anti cultural movie. Who could really believe that this crew would be so blatantly juvenile. They acted like 14 year old kids left alone for the weekend.My daughter really liked this movie, I really didn't. According to this films score (8.6) and it's standing in the top 250 (currently # 36) I must be wrong, and maybe I am, but to me this movie stands in the middle of the mediocre 50,000, a very unremarkable film."
"This isn't really a movie review. It's more a reaction. After watching this movie, I feel like running around screaming, ""You're missing the point! You're missing the point!"" Perhaps I'm missing the point. The film gets kudos for being clever and quirky and well-filmed, in a Being John Malkovich kind of way. Clever, quirky, but there's a spiritual barrenness underlying it. Shouldn't art be more than clever? Shouldn't it reach deeper? Limericks are clever ¬ñ we don't call them art. The underlying message in Eternal Sunshine isn't all that original. I am tired of seeing movies about love and loneliness. How many movies have we all seen whose basic point is that if you just reach out, take a chance, find romance, this will fend off the ravening wolves of loneliness at the door of modern life? In a culture that desperately needs a sense of community and connection, peddling movies and songs about romance is like giving cotton candy to a starving person.It isn't what we need! Finding romance is not the way to fend off loneliness and alienation, a change in the culture is. If we all felt connected to something that mattered, to other living things, to communities we cared about, romances wouldn't be the be-all and end-all of meaningful existence, it would be just one among many of life's joys."
"On a Valentine Day, Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) feels the impulse of going to Montauk instead of working. After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is another intriguing and original screenplay written by Charlie Kaufman, certainly one of the most intelligent writers in the contemporary Hollywood. With the exception of the boring ""Human Nature"", all his other recent screenplays (""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"") are at least very originals. The love story of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is fascinating and the cast is stunning. The underrated Jim Carrey and the magnificent Kate Winslet give other awesome performances, showing a great chemistry in their leading roles. The supporting cast, with the names of Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson and Mark Ruffalo is superb, and it is really worthwhile watching this great film. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Brilho Eterno de Uma Mente Sem Lembran√ßas"" (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"")"
"''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' is a big and strange name, but it matches perfectly this movie. I can say this is one of my favorite films at all, and one of the things that makes it so special to me, is the fact that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. Jim Carrey finally has a serious role and Kate Winslet is great as Clementine, the very extroverted girl with the most hair varieties you can imagine. (It is different from the British girl characters she is used to play)The story is focused in the relationship of Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Joel discovered that his ex girlfriend Clementine erased him from her memories, using the procedure of Lacuna's clinic, developed by Dr. Mierzwiak. Angry with that fact, Joel decides to erase his memories with Clem as well, but during the procedure he sees that he actually loves and wants to keep his memories with her. The movie shows their new meeting without remembering each other and Joel's memories of their relationship. The End is enigmatic, but far from the clich√©.I really recommend it!aka ""O Brilho Eterno De Uma Mente Sem Lembran√ßas"" - Brazil"
"I cannot emphasize enough how much I hated this film. It was such an interesting concept and the teasers made it look so good that I had to go and see the movie. Unfortunately, as in so many cases, once you have seen the trailer, the film is identical but has been made about two hours longer. The end result is that you already know what is going to happen and are left waiting for the end so that you can leave to talk about how bad it all was...I desperately wanted this film to be good. I hoped it would be as visually dramatic as the previews suggested. I prayed the cast would live up to their reputations and bring it alive. What I found was that no amount of desire was going to save this film. Avoid it at all cost."
"I don't care if this movie is on more than 50 critics top 10 lists. It was, in my eyes, a horrible film. One of the worst films I sat through in a long time. I actually felt I wasted 2 hours of my life I can never get back. I also know 9 other people who rented this mess and hated it just as much. The video clerk called this movie a ""stinker."" I know I am in the minority here. But I stand by what I say. I would never watch this movie again. Jim Carrey cannot do drama. In fact, he is not much of an actor. He's just a modern day Jerry Lewis. When he attempts to express anguish, he puts on his typical rubber face expressions. I know I am gonna get lots of flack for saying this. But I hated hated hated this movie. It was weird in a bad way, totally stupid, and a waste of Kirsten Dunsts talents. For those of you who praise this film, more power to you. I'll never ever watch it again. I thought it made the ""Friday the 13th"" films look like Oscar winners. Seriously. Alful, pointless, and enternally boring. I give it a huge thumbs down and a zero rating."
"Focus is an independent production company which dwells on the non-conventional ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is, to say the least, a non-conventional film!! This movie, which is a purveyor of many Molotov Mardi Gras emotions, authenticates an equivocal potpourri of ideas that are indicative of numerous independent production company films!! This movie also bears a striking similarity to Elia Kazan's intensity to itemize belligerent confrontation!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is sort of a counter culture version of the film ""The Arrangement"". Many films that are run of the mill mainstream Hollywood movies immediately hack out a succinct and concise mindset of everyone of the major character's feelings. In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to say that Joel's (Jim Carey) feelings were introverted, would be a paramount utterance of understatement!! Joel's relationship with Clementine,( a name we associate with a folklore about loving regrets, also, with a particular type of orange) evokes a vivid presentation which signifies an emotional diligence. The illogical transition to their pursuing ideas and trepidations compound an inexplicably and unnecessary intransigence for both of them!! The ephemeral activities in this film perpetuate a cerebral anguish which becomes the heinous culprit to Joel and Clementine's difficulty to adequately dissect their conceptions about one another!! I could see this film 100 times and still not capture every intricate detail to it!! Set in a New York City neighborhood, it depicts a realism about imperfection being ubiquitous in all of the character's lives!! This movie had a foreign flare to it as well!! In fact, I initially thought this film took place in Montreal... After viewing a couple of scenes, I, of course, blew that contention out the window!! My first clue was when I saw the New York License plates on every single one of the cars!! Jim Carey is FABULOUS!! in this movie!! Originally known as the box office star of copious high profit zany comedies, his enormous popularity garnered an auspicious association with the light hearted!! In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", his role was very serious and complex!! Think about it though, if someone were to handwrite a silly comedy, and then, all of a sudden, he was required to change this screenplay to a serious drama, it would be a case of simply needing to borrow someone's erasure for no more than 18 seconds!! Kate Winslet is superb in this film as well!! I did not even know she was British!! When the acting in a movie is so excellent, it almost appears as though the writers and directors of the film are getting paid only about a buck above minimum wage!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a remarkable movie, and is considered to be one of the best films ever made according to this website!! The step by step thought process to this film puts this movie in a category all by itself!! Marvelous flick!! Focus Productions always gives way to the unorthodox, perhaps you as a movie viewer should try doing the very same thing once in awhile too!! FIVE STARS!!!! ABSOLUTELY!!"
"I will admit, when it first came out last year it did not appeal a whole lot to me, but after all this talk of how great it is, I am letting everyone know that I regret not seeing this one in the theaters!It was a beautiful film, very different, very realistic, very crazy, and trippy, however, although it is strange, it is one of those movies that you can understand what's going on without it throwing you off to badly, leaving you saying ""WTF?!?!"" No, this is a fantastic movie with excellent character structure which I recommend to anyone, anyone who loves movies. However tis is not for the low intelligent people out there who wish to only see blood and explosions, while those kinds of things are entertaining, they aren't much without a story, and this was a movie with a lot of wonderful story, and it wasn't quite 2 hours!Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is living Proof that the best stories are not found in big over priced Hollywood popcorn movies, but with people who put time, effort, and love into writing a script, and producing a movie that will both entertain, shock, and leave the viewer speechless with how thought provoking and moving the film truly is. Eternal Sunshine is definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2004 if not THE BEST one. Great Job Jim, Kate, Kaufman and Gondry!"
"I struggled for a long time to like this movie. I just felt horrible; everyone was enjoying the ""best film of the last ten years"" and I just felt like I was watching cinematic vomit. I felt out of the loop, but, I suppose that's just going to have to be alright, because I refuse to like this piece of bile.First off, the plot revolves around a pretty lame plot device, namely a memory erasing company. Some people really do forget other human beings, even those they've been romantically involved with, so why rely on this lame device? Charlie Kaufman's funny dialogue and interesting plots have gone out the window, making way for some incredibly bad lines, like, ""Do you think I'm ugly?"" I just hate listening to the characters talk; they are some of the most repulsive, unlikeable characters committed to the screen. Kate Winslet's character in particular I wanted to smack. I mean, how is it possible I can stand a four hour movie starring a rapacious gangster (Once Upon a Time in America) and can't not walk out on this under-two hour claptrap starring decent humans? I wouldn't want to spend ten minutes with these bastards, let alone 100 minutes.Kirsten Dunst starts dancing in her underwear. Whoop-de-doo. Mark Ruffalo makes a mistake. Elijah Wood looks like a chihuahua. Jim Carrey looks ill. Kate Winslet spaces out and annoys the hell out of me. No actor in the movie has a breakout performance, not even Jim Carrey, who's just as annoying as he is in his comedic films. Even the score by the otherwise talented Jon Brion sucks! It's like everything that touches this movie instantly turns to sh*t.The direction, courtesy of mediocre music video director Michel Gondry, is not even worth mentioning. It's ridiculous. All of it is done very ambitiously, but most of the time it just feels stupid and over-the-top.In all, I found a predictable, bland, overrated, steaming piece of tripe. Please, never speak of it again in my presence.Overall.5/10"
"What an exciting time to be alive! We can actually go to our corner theater and participate in the invention of a new medium. Fundamental elements of the vocabulary are still being explored and invented.I knew that I was witnessing something important halfway through. Superficially this is another Kaufman exercise in self-reference. Those are always interesting, he knows how to fold the story with methods of telling the story plus a third story about those methods. There's some of that here, but it is shoehorned into the 'big idea' that wasn't his in the first place. So although you have one of the most powerful folding actors ever (Winslet), the real advance here is in another area.Hundreds of films have tried to portray dreams and visions, folding them into 'reality.' Some are blunt ('What Dreams may Come'), others frantic ('Pi') and puzzling('Mulholland Dr'). No one has yet managed the arbitrary slipperiness of visions as successfully as Tarkovsky in 'Nostalgia.' Part of Tarkovsky's genius is in making ordinary objects exotic by bending the context. But he does his work in large chunks. Any filmmaker, the real ones, make an early decision about the materials of their creation, just as an architect does. In architecture, you can choose to make the structure out of bricks. These things actually hold the building up. Then you have to design the brick. What's the right size?Tarkovsky used large bricks, so we could read them from a distance. Rodriguez , for instance, in his second act of 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' used what looks like small bricks, but they are just for show: they carry no narrative.What we have here are small bricks, small minivignettes that come at blinding speed from all tenses and actually hold up the narrative. You need an intelligent actor to help carry this off and in this case we have the redoubtable Kate who is one of our most intelligent masters of this sort of architectural material. After all, her very first film ('heavenly Creatures') was about this same matter: how small a fantasy or memory could be and still create reality.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"ESSM will be a darling of the pseudo-intellectuals who will tell you that simply don't have the mental capacity to understands the discrete levels of plot and nuance.  It's a BAD movie full of people you don't like and don't care about.Mr. Carrey's character seems to be seriously over-medicated (Paxil, Thorazine, etc.), he has no personality! (Nicholas Cage must have turned the part down.) The false timeline (the beginning of the film is really the end of the film)is a poor story devise.  The inconsistencies show up quickly, but aren't explained until the end of the movie.Finally, although the science is very sketchy, the memory-erasing technology is the ultimate form of deus ex machina.  I only wish I could erase the memory of this total waste of my time."
"After almost 20 mind-numbingly incomprehensible minutes that seemed so much longer, it comes as a shock to realize that what one is suddenly seeing floating across the screen is (after 20 minutes, remember) the ""opening"" credits of the movie. This can mean only one thing - and it isn't good news: sweet Jesus, there's still an entire movie to come.I confess that I'm not entirely enamoured of Jim Carrey. I've seen him as a weak part of a good movie (Bruce Almighty) and as the strong part of a weak movie (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). Either way, he doesn't turn my crank. I don't think I'd ever watch a movie just because the star was Jim Carrey. To be honest, in ""Eternal Sunshine ..."" I'm not sure if he's strong or weak, but it really doesn't matter because the story is absurd, disjointed and not really all that interesting. It had potential. The whole ""erasing negative memories"" had a vaguely Orwellian tone to it that intrigued me (which is why I rented it) but in the end it failed badly. When I find myself hoping (even yearning) for a movie to come to an end, I know it's been a disaster.The most intriguing thing about this movie is the following statement right off the DVD jacket it came in: [""Eternal Sunshine ... is] a memorable film that the Wall Street Journal calls 'a romantic comedy unlike any other."" I can't argue with that - it is ""memorable"" (no matter how hard I'll try to, I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it) and it is ""a romantic comedy unlike any other."" Give thanks for small mercies - this truly is one of a kind, and, in truth, there must never be another like it. 1/10"
"I have to admit, I am sorry, but I don't like the film. It's been two years since I first watched it, and with a poor memory like mine, I have completely forgotten what it is all about. The only memory I have about it is the essay I wrote as an assignment, from which I know I didn't feel a thing about it as many people do. I also remember one of its lesson, that is you can't just ignore your mistakes, you have to look them in the face‚Äîlook them really hard to be able to learn something from them‚Äîotherwise you are gonna to make the same mistakes again and again. Unless you make a change, this will be a never-ending process. Lots of things have happened since the latter half of last year. I have experienced many frustrations, I have been under huge stress, and I began to be aware of my own existence again‚Äîthe last time that I did was in my junior year, when I was involved in a vortex of mixed feelings dealing with my contenting roommates. When I repeatedly make the same mistakes, the lesson of the film comes to me, and I tell myself: ""See how you got here. You are careless to the lessons life teaches you. Be smart next time."" Therefore, I want to watch the film again, to see if I will change my mind, since it has such a depth, it helps me avoid old mistakes. But after I finished it, I still don't like it. I did change, however. The problem with it, as I see it this time, is with the way the director presents it. The humor, which he may think as a plus or as something that will make it entertaining, is exactly what ruins the film. He could have reduced some of the humorous scenes because they don't fit in with the whole tone. For example, people will laugh when they know that the young guy from the clinic steals Clement's underwear. But what't the point of that? Or, the scene that while Joel is trying hard to keep his memory, Mary and Stan were actually having a party on his bed. Maybe he wants to indicate the absurdity of the whole erasing thing, or that's his satire of the commercial world where people only care about money and are not sympathetic to your feelings, but he could have used another way. The sad love story and the kinds of humor of irresponsibility and all form a really weird combination. It may be better if the director sticks with only one of them. As for the love part, I don't feel a thing, either. Maybe I have passed the stage of life when you dream about a person who will love you as if you are the only thing he has. Rather, I respect the fact that we are two equal people, we have our own concerns, and we are together because we seem to form good partners to live the rest of our lives. I don't want him to interfere with my life too much, because there are many things to do except love. By the way, Jim Carrey is very handsome!"
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is clearly inspired by the Surrealist style of Luis Bunuel, and in particular his film ""That Obscure Object of Desire."" Unfortunately none of the wit and imagination of a Bunuel film is displayed here. Given the weak screenplay and uninspired direction it is no surprise that the actors put in such lackluster performances. The usually manic Jim Carrey looks like he phoned in his performance, and the End Credits appear as if the production team couldn't come up with anything better. David Lynch and the Coen Brothers needn't worry about competition from Charlie Kaufman in this genre. I have seen thousands of films as someone seriously into the art, and I can think of few as poorly done as this one. The many favorable reviews on this film are a mystery, and its place on the IMDb Top 250 List is a travesty. 0/5 Stars"
"It appears that Charlie Kaufman is a one trick pony. While he poses an intriguing concept, he does nothing of value with it. For some reason, the ""ardent"" movie denizens who frequent this site were mesmerized by this stunt, much in the same way that they uniformly loved the sequence stunt employed in ""Mememto"".Please. Can some screenwriter take an interesting concept and then actually develop it into something worth watching. Instead of developing a story, Kaufman simply plays mind games by distracting his audience with disjointed scenes that make little sense. And this is called genius? A complex story can be quite enjoyable if the screenwriter actually takes the time to make a coherent story with a plausible ending such as in ""The Usual Suspects"".Sorry, before one bows at the feet of any filmmaker, you should demand more than a clever proposition. Otherwise, ""The Butterfly Effect"" should have won an Oscar."
"Eternal Sunshine is neither the masterpiece that many people will have you believe nor is it awful as the backlashers claim. Once again Charlie Kaufman takes the kernel of a great idea and overloads it with his own obsessive personality. The idea of a couple fighting to retain beautiful memories of their past together while undergoing a memory erasure is ingenious. Kaufman definitely hits some poignant notes along the way (he's great at communicating the mundane pleasures and comforts of relationships), but Joel and Clementine's characters seem like mere sketches rather than fully developed people that the audience can care about. Joel in particular is maddening because he's the same schlubby protagonist that is in all of Kaufman's scripts: it's Charlie himself. The man is simply incapable of creating characters outside the bounds of his own personality. Also, the movie isn't as enjoyable as it should be. Though I wanted to see how it ended (even though I predicted the plot twist about 30 minutes into the movie), Kaufman denies the audience the pleasures of human connection with the characters in favor of convoluted, intricately distanced storytelling. The characters come across as rats in an experiment or pawns in a chess game or any other omniscient metaphor you can think of. And the subplot between the workers of Lunaca fits but in an unimaginative, convenient way. I must say that all of the performances were excellent (except Elijah Wood, but he didn't have much of a character anyway), particularly Winslet and Mark Ruffalo. Director Michel Gondry and his team of technicians give the movie an appropriately jittery, jagged rhythm and look. It feels like the work of a writer on anti-depressants and Valium filtered through the mind of a director on a 3-day caffeine binge. That's not necessarily a bad thing because without the energy and gimmickry that Gondry brings to the film, the emptiness of the conception would be all the more glaring. Don't believe the hype but don't discount the film altogether either. It seems that many people are discovering something profound in it. Self-doubt and emotional shallowness might be the new status quo."
"My boyfriend and I went to see this movie.Paid money to go into the theater. Stayed until the end. And it was over a year before either one of us ventured into a movie theater again. So... how bad could it be that it would turn us BOTH off of theater excursions for over a year?Yep. THAT bad. This had NOTHING going for it. I just hope that none of the actors in it watched it, because if I had been in this and then watched it I probably would have shot myself I would have been so embarrassed. And this is coming from someone who enjoys bad movies. Yep. THAT bad."
"The worst movie I've seen in a long time. The story line was stupid...the acting awful and the filming actually made some people nauseous...The lady in front on me had to leave twice because the filming was so amateur...it was like watching the Blair Witch Project.From the first minute of watching the movie I knew I should have left and gone to another one, but I thought I'd give it a chance andboy was I sorry when it ended."
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has a very philosophical and ethical question to ask us: Would you have an operation to forget someone completely? The movie manages to stick to not just the plot point of Joel and Clementine but also, the scientists who work in the business and what they think about what they are doing. Watching this movie reminded me of the dreams that I've had and how you wish they would go away or wish they were real but you can't wake up. Which is what Joel was stuck in. The whole movie is given a quite modern aesthetic which could be a hint at how close this procedure is from actually existing."
"Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) falls for Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) from the first moment they meet on a train. After a bad breakup, Clementine erases Joel from her memories. He decides to do the same to her. Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are the three slacker technicians who are running Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson)'s machine. As his memories are eliminated, he starts to fall in love with Clementine all over again. He struggles to hold on to his memories before it's all gone.The premise is amazing, but it's the imaginative visualization of the process that puts in on another level. Jim Carrey pours his heart into this very difficult disjointed performance. It's very effecting and probably one of his best non-impersonation performance. In its core, it's a beautiful love story. It's funny. It's poignant."
"I was just crusin through the top 100 films and Eternal Sunshine popped up in 56 place, how? I remember I had to watch this film 4 times as it knocked me to sleep every time.People saying this film has meaning is complete dribble. What did I miss? It's not interesting it's just a load of lovey dovey strange, pointless film. I just didn't get it. Help me out here, how can you like this. There must have been a lot of friends and family involved in rating this film to get it into the top 100. If you really liked this movie you have seriously got to get a life. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Pokerdot Jumper would have been more interesting. FFS GAL"
"Sorry, didn't rate this film at all. Shouldn't really say sorry though, it should be all the critics out there that rated this piece of shite, who should be saying sorry to me! What is it all about! Typical American attempt to be arty. A 10 minute film dragged into a hour and 3/4's. There is nothing wrong with the actors, but if you didn't know the ending within the 10 minute prologue to the titles, you would have to be a 5 yr old. Overrated, indulgent, crap! Why is there no story? Yes there is a nice ending. So what? You are so bored of the characters, that you don't even want to try to understand the plot! Why has it been rated so highly? Well one guy liked it and the other sheep followed. Shame on them! If you want a long weekend, watch this movie because it makes 1 3/4 hrs feel like a day. Don't buy into the hype Ste"
"I looked forward with great anticipation for the DVD release of this movie that had received a 10 for 50% of it's viewer ratings - making it #37 on the all-time list. After having seen this drek, I'm wondering if we all saw the same film. It appears that lots of people are believing the Hollywood hype that, ""If you don't understand it it most be great"". Well believe me this isn't great; it isn't good; it's awful. Uneven direction, purposely choppy plot line and ssslllllooooowwwww (to the point of being boooooring) pace combine to make the one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I loved the idea behind the story and the acting was fair, but give me a break. This movie never comes together and certainly doesn't deserve to be rated any where near the company of ""Apocalypse Now"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""The Pianist"". Save your money, don't rent this trash; don't even bother with it when it comes on regular TV."
"This film is very original in its concept and execution. Everything is very intentional in this film including lighting, colour choices, names, etc. You watch this film and really get a sense of ""Wow this director did an amazing job with the details"". All the actors here did an amazing job. Genuine. Entertaining. Beautiful piece of art."
"Hands down one my most favorite movies of all time, starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet is a brilliantly directed movie from Michel Gondry.Plot : A girl highly impulsive and the guy a calm and soft spoken gets in love and the love is gone bad. A new service opens up where they promise to erase part of your memory, the girl gets her lover erased from her memory and starts a new life. When the guy gets to know this he gets frustrated and gets an appointment to do the same. The plot starts to travel in reverse direction from the last memory of the couple getting erased. The guy gets to see the memory getting erased from him and after a point of time thinks he has taken a bad decision and tries to stop the process by trying to hide his girlfriends memory in old memories where the doctors cant reach, but it goes in vain and all the memories of them gets erased from the guys head without a spot. Finally what happens to this couple is what the whole movie is about.A very complex story telling technique, you need to watch it twice to truly appreciate the effort and ingeniousness of the script. I always felt Jim is a very underrated actor and my notion got stronger after watching this movie. Memento was my top rated movie till I saw this movie, a definite #1.Review : A truly unique script and a genius story telling, a ""MUST"" watch for all!.. 9.5/10! :)"
"I finally watched 'Eternal Sunshine...' this weekend. What a piece of absolute, unadulterated CRAP!!! From beginning to end. I mean I have seen a lot of bad movies recently, but this has to rank as THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!! And this won the Oscar for best screenplay? God! The people in Hollyweed must all have their head up their collective rectums! Now, I hate Jim Carrey, but he was absolutely horrid in this, as was Kate Winslet. Did the director actually expect anyone to feel anything for these 2-dimensional stereotypes? And the director must have gone to 'hand-held' camera 101 to learn his craft. Talk about annoying! I want my 25 cents back!!! At least most of the other garbage I've watched recently was mildly entertaining, but this wasn't even that! Did anyone actually believe they were saying something significant about the human condition here? If so, go back and watch some Renoir or Bergman or De Sica or Kurosawa or just about any of the great directors. Even Ed Wood knew more about the human condition than the bozo who wrote this!"
"To be short: this movie stinks. It was recommended to me by some guy who thinks this is the best movie in years, and that it should win several Oscars. Well, I had a look and damn what a disappointment. So this Clementine has Joel erased from her mind (first of all this is stupid, even if it COULD ever exist(the erasing thing), why not just call him and tell him that you don't want to see him anymore, problem solved), the next day Joel finds out and wants Clementine erased from his mind too. Then we get to see what goes on in Joel's mind during the procedure. To this point the movie isn't that bad. But then it starts to get bad. It just goes on and on and on about the same stupid things in Joel's mind, after a few minutes it just gets boring. Now i'm really not a guy who only likes the action part in movies but this is just like watching the same thing over and over again. Then at the end when you've spent about an hour watching the same stuff, it's like the day starts all over again with Clementine getting her toothbrush, and fighting with her new boyfriend. It's like groundhog day, starting all over again. At the end you ask yourself, what really happened, and you're left with a feeling of emptiness because this movie seems completely pointless. Just an advice: don't watch this movie."
"Did all of you watch a different movie than my wife and I watched?!  This movie was garbage.  Here's why:1.  The camera constantly shook, making it difficult to watch without getting sick to my stomach.  It reminded me of the Blair Witch Project - which at least was interesting aside from the camera shaking.2.  All of the characters were unlikable.  I couldn't care less about any of them.3.  There was no plot or purpose.  Okay, I understood the premise of erasing memories and Joel's desire to hold onto the memories after committing to have them erased.  But why all of the pointless, disjointed scenes?  One after another. Pointless, meaningless snippets of their lives together. Who cares?  Over and over and over until I felt like screaming, `Enough already! Get on with it!'  There was no mystery or anticipation of something about to happen.4.  Weird new subplots were constantly added that only confused this confusing mess even further.About 3/4 of the way through the movie, I turned to my wife and said, `What do you think?'  Her response was, `This is the worst movie I've ever watched.'  We walked out of the theatre glad to be out of there.  I couldn't care less about missing the ending because, in our view, there was no story. This was only the second movie I've ever walked out on.The whole thing seemed like a bad drug trip.  What are you people who liked this movie smoking?  For the record, we use IMDB to decide on a movie to see.  I consistently enjoy most highly rated movies.  But this highly rated movie was horrible."
"This comment is to save those people who haven't seen it yet, from its false advertising... I have NO IDEA why this movie is rated #33 on IMDb! That just shows how weird people are. Maybe I wasn't all that interested in the characters and their interaction or development, but rather it was awkward, confusing, and such a waste. I didn't like the characters AT ALL, and there wasn't really any good chemistry between them. They were miserable together, and they ended it, and then they chose to give it another shot, even if it will be miserable again! Now, I give them the credit for going along for the ride - but relationships aren't supposed to be like that. There are actually good relationships out there, but this superficial world seeking for pleasure in temporal and destroying substances is indicative and portrayed in this movie. It's interesting that they needed alcohol to make things romantic, always. It shows a lot about their character, and the character of those people who loved the movie! I just couldn't wait for the movie to END! This movie is really terrible. It made me dizzy and confused. I had NO GOOD feelings come out of it, and felt I had wasted 2 hours of my life. It isn't entertaining, uplifting, or edifying AT ALL. Really, Don't Waste Your Time With This Movie."
"'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' has an unnecessarily long title and is way too strange and convoluted to take seriously. It is understandable to show a story told from a different perspective, but a filmmaker has to set limits. It makes no sense in trying to confuse the audience as much as you can. That does not make the film intelligent or original. 'Eternal Sunshine..' is too full of itself; it says, 'look how creative I am, telling this story in such an odd way. I dare you to figure it out'. Nobody will gain anything if the filmmakers are trying to make the audience look stupid. It only creates an exaggerated ego for those who do understand it. The story is about two lovers who decide to erase the memory of each other. When they are erased from each other's memory, they find themselves drawn back to each other by sheer chance. I think one point the film is trying to make is that true love is a destiny. Two people are drawn to each other because there is something greater is at work, bringing lovers together. Fantastic idea, but it can be told in much simpler ways than done in this movie. The idea shouldn't be expressed in the over-the-top way that it was done in 'Eternal Sunshine..'. Good performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, an unlikely pair bringing chemistry to the screen, but even they couldn't save this jumbled mess."
"Saw this last night and it is pretty nigh unwatchable.  We kept debating whether to walk out but stayed in the bleak hope that there might be one small gram of redeeming humor or insight in the entire 2 hours.  Where do I begin to dissect this abortion of a movie?  The characters that Carey and Winslett play are both visually disgusting (everyone in this movie badly needs a bath and a wardrobe that has not been acquired primarily from dumpsters), and are whiney, and utterly annoying creations.  Carey is dull, lifeless, totally uninspired and looks physically ill.  He NEEDS to go back to the comedies for which he has a true gift rather than making these dreadful ""artistic"" movies.  Winslett's character is obviously insane, and if I were a man to whom she made advances I would flee in horror.   The ""impulsiveness"" she attributes to herself would obviously be the hallmarks of several major mental illnesses in real life.  When you put these two together, the only party who could gain any advantage from the match would be a manufacturer for razor blades. The desire to erase either of these grungy losers from one's mind would be only natural and logical. The movie simply makes no sense - the ""plot"" is extremely difficult to follow as the movie jumps back and forth with no apparent logic or design.  The effect is jarring and nerve-wracking.  There is no apparent editing, which might have created the semblance of a cohesive narrative.  There is no apparent script -the characters look like they are manufacturing their assorted incoherent rantings and mumblings on the spot.  As for direction - I think the only direction this movie needed ultimately was the sign directing us to the EXIT."
"This is seriously the worst film I have ever watched at the cinema(including Double Jeopardy!). I can't believe I paid good money to see such an incoherent, rambling film. For all those people out there that have given this film a good write up will you please explain to me what was actually good about this film. Nothing happened! I have always enjoyed Jim Carrey as an actor, but to choose to do this film I have to question him. His character was boring, dull and totally lifeless. Kate Winslet's so called American accent kept changing back to English!The concept of the film should have led to entertainment - instead it failed miserably and I found myself talking to friends during the film, as was everybody else in the cinema because this film is that bad!There is only one thing I ask - please can you invent the machine from the film and erase the 2 hours that I wasted yesterday! Oh and also a tree that produces money so I can get my wasted ¬£5 back!"
"Charlie Kaufman is probably the most unbearable screenwriter whose movies I've ever had the misfortune of seeing: the masturbation scenes in ""Adaptation"" sum up his artistic contributions perfectly. ""Eternal Sunshine"" is just more masturbation. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have no chemistry, and most of the characters' performances are flat and unconvincing, as if they can't believe they're acting this crap out either. Not to mention the nonsensical, confusing plot, and how aesthetically unpleasant most of the film is. I couldn't recommend this movie less; without a doubt, one of the worst I have ever seen. If only they could purge my memory of having seen it."
"Ten minutes into ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, it was clear that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has a limited bag of tricks. What was clever in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH the first time I saw it became pretentious during the second viewing and insufferable during the third viewing. ADAPTATION was a similarly too-clever pretentious exercise in modernist style with no substance. ETERNAL SUNSHINE mines the same vein, but this time around the results are about as substantial as cotton candy and as permanent as a fireworks display. Except for the cutesy plot device--which was refreshing decades ago when handled by the likes of a Godard or a Philip K. Dick or a Harold Pinter--the film is like a second-string Woody Allen project fed into a blender (or rewritten by Donald Barthelme). The ""insights"" about relationships in this film are, as one critic aptly described it, about as profound as those in a Hugh Grant movie. And as ""experimental"" as Kaufman may think he is being, the plot is as predictable as that of any b-movie, once one figures out the premise of the story (which the slowest audience member will do in about 20 minutes). And what's the point of the murky faux-cinema-verite visual style in many scenes? The three points out of ten I awarded this film are primarily for the actors, Jim Carrey in particular. When will the Hollywood establishment and the critics finally learn that Kaufman is a one-trick-pony? The emperor is not wearing any clothes here. As someone who has championed and supported TRUE avant-garde filmmaking for decades, I see this as a cheap Hollywood pastiche of the avant garde. Those who found John Sayles' LONE STAR to be ""multi-layered"" instead of cliche-ridden will find much to praise and discuss in ETERNAL SUNSHINE. While Kaufman is not as bad as P.T. Anderson (at least Mr. Kaufman manages to honor traditional story structures while re-fashioning them, and at least he can create REAL if shallow characters, something Anderson hasn't learned to do), my evening would have been better spent watching a straight-to-video action film or some obsscure 1950s Allied Artists post-noir crime film. Rent this one...or better yet, rent something else!"
"I've been a Kaufman fan since he was writing for television, and was blown away by Malkovich, like most everyone was. It's truly shocking this movie is 200 places higher rated than either Malkovich or Adaptation among IMDb users (#35 on the top 250, compared to #208 and #235 respectively). I thought this movie was great, though not as inventive as his prior work. Actually, this movie is probably the most conventional movie Kaufman's written besides ""Confessions"".Also, a shout out to those who think Spike Jones directed this, actually Michel Gondry did. Gondry has given us better crafted movie than Spike Jones has with Kaufman's scripts. This movie's full of fun visual gags. Still, I'd love to see what how Kaufman's scripts panned out if he ever paired up with a director that didn't come from the music video generation. As far as performances go, the best aspect of this movie is Kate Winslet. The character that Kaufman gave her is spectacular, and she is awesome as usual. Carrey's character just mopes a lot. In the end, Carrey's performance in this movie is nowhere near his performance in.... ta-da... Cable Guy. Cable Guy is his best and most underrated work. Carrey was born to do goofy faces and over the top characters, why not appreciate the movies where he's at the top of his game? It's not exactly a subtle performance, but since when is subtle always better? Would we ask the Three Stooges to do Hamlet?"
"hi, first of all DO NOT read this any further if you don't want me to spoil it for you cos i will reveal something about the plot! this movie was not easy to watch and made me look after 50mins how much time was left and i was shocked when i saw how long it goes..i can understand that people liked it cos users of this site seem to love every drama no matter if its good or not. this one was definitely not good, i liked the acting..kate winslet was good..she should be annoying and thats how i felt about the character she played..this weird freak type of girl you don't want to hang out with..well, coming to the story..this all was about erasing memory..she got hers erased then he wants his erased..then you find out the doc who did it erased the memory of one of his female employees because they had a romance and his wife didn't know..i don't understand how a movie about something dumb like that could get such a high rating on here..dramas..i don't hate dramas but it gets boring if dramas get such a high rating.well, I'm not a big review writer but i have higher expectations from movies."
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind wants to be a bittersweet comedy about erotic loss and memory loss. But it doesn't have the heart or brain. It does have an idea with so many clever compartments that audiences can unload their emotional baggage into it. And that may be enough to make it a critical hit but it will just tank at the box office. Without more depth and inspiration, all this cleverness ultimately goes down the drain. Critics are determined to give this film a high grade because they want to seem clever but the fact is that this film is just a strange mess and nothing deep at all.  Bizarre for bizarre sake because you really don't care about either one of these strange characters."
"Don't erase my memory. I want to remember this film so that I can remember to never see a film by Michel Gondry again. If it wasn't for the fact that this film was forced upon me on two occasions, I wouldn't have touched it with a barge pole. It is basically a story of a shy recluse called Joel (Jim Carrey) who meets lively and eccentric Clementine (Kate Winslet). They fall in love but their relationship is turbulent due to their contrasting personalities. Finally, an accident involving Clementine and Joel's car ends the relationship and Clem goes to have her memory of their relationship erased. She says during the interview before the erasure that she wants to erase Joel because 'he's boring'. In an act of spiteful revenge, Joel decides to erase Clementine as well. It is during the erasure process that he finds out that he actually wants to keep his memories as there were some moments of the relationship which he treasured. In his mind, he contrives a agreeable Clementine who is eager to help him preserve the memory of them as a couple, which is very ironic as Clementine erased him first.The main part of the story concerns the ways in which Joel and his made-up Clementine try to preserve Joel's memory of the relationship. This is supposed to be a romantic comedy with touches of noir and sci-fi but where is the comedy? More importantly, where is the romance? There are very few laughs to be gotten out of this film and the characters seem more interested in sex than true love. All the tender moments in which they share a tete-a-tete take place during sex scenes. During the erasure, Joel once returns to his childhood self and Clem shows him her crotch to bring him back. If it was indeed true love that they had, then Joel wouldn't have been vengeful enough to erase Clem.The characters are hard to like as they are too flawed to offer any inspiration. Joel has serious social and communication problems while Clementine is unpredictable, irresponsible and uncouth. The writer seemed to have thought that giving them swear words to say added to their personality. The storyline is also hard to follow as it is not set in chronological order. The only time indicator is Clem's hair colour. The main idea of the film is that memories contribute to who we are and are therefore important and should not be tampered with. It also implies that without bad memories we will never feel very happy as we will not have the bad moments to compare with the good moments. The memory of films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind and the like makes me appreciate directors such as Ridley Scott, Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg much more."
"I know that Kate Winslet has been nominated for a best actress Oscar for this movie,but I sure don't see why.As a rule I do not like Jim Carrey, but that is probably due to his reminding me of Jerry Lewis,whom I also can't stand.In this movie Jim Carrey was very good in the role, at least his dramatic performance, outshone all of his performances,that I have seen The story started of rather interestingly enough, but totally lost me after about 20 minutes. I found it rather difficult to believe that this team of so called Brain technicians, were operating out of some filthy sloppy apartment, wherein Jim Carrey is laid out on a bed, where people are jumping all over, and running about the room.The story became so involved, with crazy sub plots, it became so convoluted, neither my husband or I knew ,what the heck was going on.Unless you are a die hard Jim Carrey fan, I wouldn't recommend this movie. In a way it reminded a little of Memento, which by the way is a much better flick."
"I admit I only saw about the first 45 minutes; I just could not stand any more; this film was excruciating to watch. Worse by far than the nasty ''Adaptation.'' Probably second only to ""Sweetie,"" another horrifying film billed as a comedy. How could Kate Winslet, after her terrific performance in ''Iris,'' have signed on for this trash? Did the filmmakers set out to induce headache and nausea? The story, the lighting, the camera-work, the editing--they really made me seasick. And it's hard to care about characters who don't like themselves enough to engage in basic grooming. What in the world was romantic about this story of abuse, alcoholism, relationship addiction, and depravity? There was no compassion for the obvious sickness of the characters. Uck, uck, uck. I wish I could erase the memory of this piece of pretentious, stomach-turning nonsense from my aching head."
"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The most stupid plot, no action, no laughs, no ""food for thought"". Further, the characters are terribly dull and the acting far from acceptable. From the very beginning, I never did understand what was going on. And after about 20 minutes, I didn't care. The ending was the silliest thing I've ever witnessed. Anyone who says this is a good movie must either be getting paid or else is trying to impress someone. No one, and I mean no one, who enjoys movies could find a single redeeming quality in this bomb.This is another case of the race some directors are having to see who makes the craziest movie ever,for which they think they've made a ""Masterpiece"""
"Saw the high score and thought it might a good movie.How very wrong could I be? On paper it has all the right ingredients - Jim Carie, Kate Winslet, 8.6 score. All of which, means absolutely nothing where this film is concerned.A very simple story, boy meets (very weird) girl, who has 'brain surgery' to forget him. He finds out and wants it himself. Next follows 80 minutes of his weird dreams, followed by the credits (a welcome sight for sore eyes).If you watch this film because of Jim Carey or Kate Winslet, then prepare to be disappointed. It is not the type of film they've made their names from.I think had this film had lesser known actors in it, it would surely not have attracted the watch-20-times-oh-i-understand-now brigade and received a more deserving score of about 2.5.Don't know if such a score puts it in the bottom 10 films of-all-time, but it surely deserves to be there."
