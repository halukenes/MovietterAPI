Reviews
"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement."
"A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.Yes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it's time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.This one is a keeper in my movie library."
"It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER."
"While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was:  a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.Because before they were anybody, they were just the writers of this tale of a reluctant human being named Will Hunting, a mathematical genius who wore the guise of a hoodlum, and all of the sudden obstacles he had to take on to truly step in to manhood.  Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will's mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he's in), and a girl who doesn't understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.It was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships).  His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching."
"This is one of those films that you cant help walking away from without being touched in some way. All of the central themes to adult life are explored and exposed by a very good cast. Friendship, love, pain, the past holding back who we could be in the present, acceptance (or not) of our place in society.""Good Will Hunting"" is the story of Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. He is a young man who is a mathematical genius but has no formal education and who is so traumatised by his past that he will not allow himself to be the man he could with his talents. Will works as a Janitor, but chose the Massachusetts institute of technology (the finest mathematical institution in America as we are told) as the place to work in order to be close to an outlet for his brilliance. Early on in the story, the resident Maths guru Professor Gerry Lambeau sets a problem for his students to solve which should take the whole semester for the average mind. When this problem is solved and written on the faculty blackboard the very next morning, he sets another that took him personally two years to solve. The following day he is conversing with a colleague when he witnesses Will writing down the perfect solution on the blackboard again. The Professor realises he has a genius hiding in his midst.When Will is later involved in a fight, he is eventually given the choice between a short prison term or working with the Professor on a daily basis and also attending psychiatric therapy sessions. Will chooses the latter but uses the therapy sessions as a chance to mock the Psychiatrists assigned to him and show off his knowledge. When no one else will work with him, Professor Lambeau turns to his old room mate at college, Sean MacGuire (played by Robin Williams on Oscar winning form.) who manages to reach the boy emotionally and start to repair the damage that has been done to him.It is widely known that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck co wrote the screen play as a reaction to their slow progress in establishing Hollywood careers. It is a testament to their talent as writers that they came up with so many touching scenes and passages of dialogue. In particular, Williams monologue to Damon when sat on the park bench is sublime. Wills relationship with ""Skylar"" (played by Minnie Driver) is perfectly believable and as the story unfolds the viewer can see the change in Wills character from the cocky kid, pushing everyone away, to the young man who understands who he could be with the right encouragement.There are very few flaws to be found in this film, largely because the story is so well told and Robin Williams performance is worth the entry price alone. It is a genuinely touching experience which relates to so many people and is easy to empathise with in real life. The characters are richly written and they are all interdependent in the telling of the proceedings. You really care what happens to these people.I could ""nick pick"" and draw attention to the psychiatrist scenes in Robert Redfords ""Ordinary People"" (1980) which bear close resemblance to the ones in ""Good Will Hunting"" but I think Damon and Affleck just took the bar up another notch with their interpretation of the Doctor / Patient working relationship.All in all an uplifting and worthwhile movie going experience which will stay with you long after you leave the cinema."
"I am totally dumbfounded by some of the reactions to this film.  I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket.  Then there are the people calling it unrealistic.  Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently.  Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing!  Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK.  Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel.  The script is one of the best I've ever seen.  The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like ¬ëThe Catcher in the Rye'.  Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, ¬ëget in touch with your inner Robin Williams'.  But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board.  Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells.  Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines `Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?'  `Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it.  Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will!  I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms.  But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast.   It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream.  Let them watch this ¬ëchewing gum for the mind' and we discerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema.  I think a quote is in order here directed to all you viewers who deemed this film boring or unrealistic `If ignorance is bliss, there should be more happy people.'"
"This is the best movie I have seen since the Godfather.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make a great team...not only as actors, but more impressively as co-writers.  Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would ""lay down in traffic for you"".  Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired (except maybe a beard trimmer...).The most amazing thing about this movie is the writing.  Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list.  I was captivated from beginning to end.If you've not seen it, Good Will Hunting is without doubt a ""renter"", and I think after seeing it, it's one you'll want to own to watch again and again."
"So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us. I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent."
"This is a screenplay, whose script was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon and sold for $ 600,000. (They split the proceeds)I love this movie. I have seen it several times, and I still want more at the end (Isn't that what good movies do to you?) The subplots make for mini-movies of their own, especially the interplay between Robin Williams' character and Stellan Skarsgard's character.Damon's real life buddy Affleck plays that same buddy role in GWH, and provides the definition for true friendship.Minnie Driver is compelling, and I just love a couple of scenes when she and Damon are in a novelty store, and another where she is telling a joke in a bar with Damon, Affleck and friends. The love story which develops with Driver is very convincing, and it's ""under the surface"" portrayal plus input from one of our favorite characters makes for one of the best definitions of intimacy I have ever seen on film.When I see some of the movies in IDB's top 250, I am sad that this movie isn't in there, but that is my opinion. Torn between GWH and Rounders as Damon's best movie, though I think GWD plays to a wider audience."
"The name of the film always put me off watching it. Ever so glad i was convinced in to it. Only the fact that there is so much bad language and for Titanic being released in the same year this would have swept the boards in the Oscars!I hate Robin Williams as a comedian, but i was in tears after watching his timeless performance. I love most of the classic movies but this is definitely the best film i have ever seenMat Damon played a great part, showing the full spectrum of emotions in his role.I've ever gone out and bought the soundtrack to the film, i've watched it half a dozen times and always go right through to the final credits.Pure brilliance!"
"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script.  The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.What ""Hunting"" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity.  What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure.  This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing.  The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating.  Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck ""paid their dues"" -- and success did not just fall into their laps.  These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality. ""Good Will Hunting"" is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the  creativity of Damon and Affleck."
"Surprised to see so many people disliked this one. Personally, as a guy who just enjoys watching a movie, this is exactly what I like to see. I couldn't care less if it's unrealistic or if the plot is obvious and you can guess the ending about an hour before it happens. This is a masterpiece, at least in my tiny and unimpressive brain."
"Why another review? Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.It is very hard to believe two 25yos wrote this script with such realistic relational depth. There are some very powerful emotional dynamics in this movie--the scene with Will & Skyler in her apartment when Will unpacks. The monumental scene with Will and Sean ""It's not your fault""--when a movie is a template for real life, this is an epic work of art! This movie allowed people to talk and relate when emotions were road blocks, to point to a scene in Good Will Hunting to establish a base for communication.Here's a point in real time. I was writing this review and a friend called. He ended up hanging up the phone on me because I questioned him about a project. He did a ""Will"" in Skyler's room on me because I tapped a dark shadow in his life. His sensitivity to being questioned is such a part of his identity he is unconscious about, but something that causes him great conflict in his marriage which is now a divorce, his inability to stay employed, and history with addiction.This movie lays a template for men's issues!"
"Good Will Hunting is a story about a 20 year old MIT janitor named Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon). The not-so-flashy hobbies of Mr. Hunting include hanging out with his friends, telling jokes, drinking beer and starting fist fights. But you know what? He's also stupefyingly gifted at mathematics. Will seems to know math better than anyone else in the world, including a Field-medal awarded professor with whom he talks in the movie, just because he has heard some MIT lectures and read a couple of books.Sounds realistic? No it doesn't. What the movie loses in it's realism, it aims to gain in it's emotional power. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this story of the hardships of a mathematical genius the way they did to make a typical moviegoer identify him/herself with the main character. At it's core, Good Will Hunting is a collection of very finely executed drama: romance, violence, fight against authorities. You name it, GWH has it. The level of acting offered by Damon, Affleck, Skarsg√•rd and Driver is good. Robin Williams is excellent.The movie contains a reference to Srinivasa Ramanujan, a mathematical prodigy from a poor Indian background, who astonished the world with his unconventional theories in the early 20th century. This real life genius received a big book about advanced trigonometry from his teacher at age 10, came to understand it fully by the age of 13 and dedicated the rest of his life to mathematical research.If Hunting was portrayed as an eccentric like Ramanujan and if his mathematical abilities were an integral part of the character's way of seeing the world, this movie wouldn't probably have had as much viewers as it ended up having, but it could have had some depth and believability.Sadly Hunting's mathematical/logical abilities are only portrayed in scenes in which he draws some diagrams on paper or chalkboard. It's understandable that creating a superbly talented mind entirely from scratch is hard for writers who are not mathematical geniuses. You might ask then, why did Damon & Affleck choose to write a story about a mathematical genius in the first place? Had they chosen any other type of talent, they would very probably have been able to create a more convincing character. My guess is that they did that simply because mathematical abilities are often seen as something mystical and mystical abilities draw in crowd to theaters.I had high hopes for Good Will Hunting. Sadly this movie is embarrassingly childish and sentimental collection of audience luring issues with very little credibility."
"10 years ago I've watched it. And it gave me only pain ever since. Pure and clear, I hate this movie. Rather, what's here to love?! Let me tell you, the moment when (Robin Williams) was talking about his wife who farted till she waked herself up, the joke of the girl in the caf√© about old people's love, the stupid never-ending lecture about genius guys (which seems copied, as it is, from many books), all of that are little instances for how disgusting and boring this movie is. Actually, this is what lived from it with the poor me. And when it comes to its cast, then let me bleed with hate; (Ben Affleck) is underrated actor, he is, since he isn't hated enough! I just can't stand (Minnie Driver) as an actress. And (Matt Damon) is so cold and unconvincing in mostly all what he does. There is a good story there, but totally murdered by adolescent script and provocatively mute direction. Nothing is beautiful in this movie. And while it's supposed to be touchy, it totally isn't. Save the scene of (Affleck) talking about missing his friend, I didn't enjoy anything. Enough to say that after its ending, I blamed myself hardly for setting all through it, and after 10 years I still do. Without further ado, and to be incredibly objective; THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR ME."
"What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied hereThere are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in lifeBut I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing"
"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/. It isn't ever so multi-faceted. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries.Better to have made Will a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon's too short."
"So many fans, so little to show for it.  I know, I know, these words are gonna find me in a great minority.  A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting.  But seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let's put the blame where it belongs...  in the writing.Now, I know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen.  But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons.  And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while.  And of course, the Miramax public relations machine secured Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there's better movies out there thatn GWH."
"Um... Maybe I just didn't get it... but everyone thinks i am a freak with no soul because i hated this movie...I will tell you why i hated it...First off, i began to literally fall asleep in the middle of the movie because this movie was very very boring. The story absolutely sucked. I don't see how these guys won a best screenplay for this. The dialogue was painfully forced and unrealistic--am I supposed to laugh at the ""how do you like them apples line"".. am i supposed to feel a sense of accomplishment for the character? Instead with that line, and in fact that whole scene and the rest of the movie had me saying ""WTF?????""Not to mention that scene in the bar again, but who has conversations at a bar like that? Not even Harvard attendees talk like that at a bar--they are busy doing keg stands and playing beer pong.Where were the basic elements of a good story in this? Rising action--climax--falling action--character development--protagonist--antagonist. Is anyone with me on this...Or am I alone in the world?"
"I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're ""supposed"" to sob -- or at least feel ""touched"". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. Worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all cliched.I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so I figured a single balancing vote won't hurt."
"Sappy.I liked how they went to the ""Haaavaad baaa"" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.Just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. ""Do you like apples?""the guy nods or something.""Well, how'd ya like DEM APPLES!"" Wow, that IS genius.Duh, Minnie Driver would give her number to anybody. Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf. And there's a professor who always wears a priest scarf for no reason."
"This is one of the most overrated films I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.  I didn't care about any of the characters and the dialogue was incredibly pretentious.  It made me ill.  Some posters on here have chosen to belittle those who give this a low rating.  My reply to you is that I deal with the real world and real people everyday and think this movie is absurd.  The world revolves around Damon's character and the ludicrous scene in the bar made me want to puke.  ""How do you like them apples?""  ""Let's go eat caramels.""  What profound dialogue!  This guy is just too cool.  Give me a break.  If I met people like this in real life I would tell them to grow up or label them a phony.  This is the Anti-American Indie movie in all its self-importance."
"When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an ""intelligent person"" is like, they fail so miserably, finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported ""genius"".Right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. Sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights ¬ñ it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.Plus, if you are a genius you know all about Math and History and Politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them. Coz these things, like, all go together n stuff, y'know?Plus, you walk around with a smirk all the time. You are just a smug son of a you-know-what, that's how it is, y'all. And of course you smoke, like someone who never smoked before, but you smoke coz it's like cool n stuff, y'know. And you're different. That is understood.And of course you can fight ¬ñ you're a bully. A bully who finds time to study 10.000 books whenever he doesn't lift weights. And whenever he doesn't smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regimen.And you date a 30-something college student ¬ñ Minnie Driver. Well, I won't even comment Matt Damon. Team America has hit the nail on the head already.This movie is a daydream of a Beavis & Butthead type student (in other words 95% of them): ""Yeah, that's what I would be like if I was a genius."" But stupid people and stupid authors in this case cannot imagine the lives of geniuses."
"I don't understand the hoopla for this movie.  It was all right, a couple of good moments, but it didn't add up to anything, and I completely forgot the entire experience ten minutes after I was outside the theatre.  Anyone who doesn't like a lot of swearing should stay away, too.  I swear at times, too, but not like these people.  For the most part, an unpleasant time."
"I know for sure, that if Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had not been the ones credited with having wrote this film, nobody would have seen this film. Whats more, nobody would have cared. This is Hollywood at its ""Indie"" best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a ""feel good"" story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years. In reality, this film is ** out of ****. However, did you know that Matt and Ben wrote it? **** out of ****."
"Awful, nauseating, egotistical, pretentious, amateurish. With God-Like Intelligence and Wisdom, Will Hunting's character is established as he mops the school floor. Without wringing the mop or placing a warning sign for slippery surface, Will carelessly slops water toward several students. If he was so intelligent, it seems to me that he would be able to mop a floor correctly. This is truly a horrible movie on many levels. How does he know everything? We don't see him reading and amassing his encyclopedic knowledge. It appears that Matt Damon spends more time grooming his cute hair-do than perusing mathematics tomes at the library. Ben Affleck was terrible..he is truly a bad actor. Robin Williams was the only bright spot in this black hole of a movie. The award Good Will Hunting should have received was the Golden Turkey Award."
"I can't understand why people like this film.The basic concept was great, but it could have been SO much better.It fails on many levels:1:  The basic story makes no sense.  Will Hunting is shown to possess not just intelligence, but extreme awareness of a vast, VAST body of literature. He can quote obscure books in psychology, economics, art, etc etc etc  
Here's a news flash:  this kind of knowledge doesn't come from innate intelligence, it also requires incredible amounts of reading. So when did Will supposedly do all this reading?  we see him depicted as a working-class goof-off who spends his time carousing with his friends and getting into fights.  Sorry, but that doesn't compute.  At all.2: The direction and editing is terrible.  All of the key moments go by as if they weren't even important. The end of the movie just leaves you saying, ""Huh?....."" But my, aren't the lead actors good looking? That, and the superb performance by Robin Williams are all that can be said for this amateur effort.   But what do I know...."
"What is so good about this film? I hated this film with so many reasons. The hero,Matt Damon is a handsome genius with early life trauma,so he is allowed to do anything and using foul language and fist fighting and all that gives him extra charm. But he seemed like either a complete hypocrite or a artifice-made-to-plot to me.  If all he wanted in life was getting drunk and fight why did he choose to work in the university(what a convenient place to be noticed for the sake of story) as a janitor in the first place? Why not burger king? With the vast knowledge and deep insight in politics, economics and psycho-analysis, why wasn't he able to get over with his own problem?And that counselling session, learn-from-each other and klick!problem solved!!! No, it's so schematic and unconvincing as the whole film. I totally agree on the user comment(what an arrogant...) During the film, listening to their ping-pong talk, I thought of Forrest Gump. Despite all the flaws and non-sensical coincidences, I think Forrest Gump is a very moving film. If you ask the differences of the two films, I would say:surrealism vs pseudo-realismrunning(release of freedom,metaphor of advance, hope)vs talking(do you know what you are talking about?)Ideal simpleton and whiny, pretentious genius.Should've watched on big screen, wouldn't have watched on video."
"This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one."
"It's very predictable that a movie like this would soon be placed into that undefined category of ""good"" recent movies, which includes any film having the smallest bit of sincerity and meaning. The fact that the popular trend is toward the visual and that special effects are replacing plots and subtle nuances tends to lead the average viewer to the opinion that any film that attempts these is a grand effort. This is not true. ""Good Will Hunting"" does not even have a well-defined plot, but that fits into the movie acceptably: it's an extraordinary man's search for himself through love, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. The premier problem is that the movie overplays it's best card: Matt Damon's(character's) incredible brain. There is a certain point at which the audience should halt its fascination at his mental profencies and sigh in boredom. It's unfortunate that this was not the case for most theaters. Though the meaning of life and gifted individuals are good themes for movies, they are not original, and this ""tear-jerker"" makes no unique contributions to either idea. In fact, if you want to see real meaning in a popular movie, rent ""Rocky"", a title which many supposed ""film experts"" would probably not want to admit conveys deeper human meaning than most ""good"" movies, like (appropriately) Good Will Hunting. Shame on you,  movie fans, for falling in love with such a butchered attempt at profundity."
"I admire films that shoot high and miss. But it really rankles me when a film pretends to shoot high, avoids doing so because of lack of talent, and lies to us in the process.There's great drama in the mere existence of an idiot savant. These are people who often are intolerable socially, inadequate in common thinking skills, and generally lead a cursed `elephantman' life, except for their celebration as (in this case) mathematicians. Instead, we're given a watered down likeable homeboy who has been abused. Oh and he has a photographic memory which is a separate pathology (the two never coincide). Depth discarded.There's truly deep drama in the mathematical problems good Will would be dealing with. But this would require a Nabokov, and his mastery of metaphor. Instead we get the koolaid version for dummies in some (as it turns out) meaningless scribbles and a bubble diagram. Depth is twice discarded. Believe me, this could be played up big; the power of a christ in some of the insights that are speculated -- the voice and eye of God.There's also common, but good drama in the dedicating of one's life to their gift at great personal sacrifice. We actually have some good films in this regard concerning musicians. Math is better since you don't even get the applause. Here the guy with the insights but lack of language would be codependent martyr with the expert in the formalisms but no vision. But too hard, so pass.I can attest that there are cinematic depths to be mined at NSA, MIT, even Southie in terms of the absolutely unique and strange feel of the places. How could this film have missed those dark assets and end up so totally without atmosphere?This movie got made for one reason only: Robin Williams saw a part for himself. Therefore, the previously described  ignorances are filled by an amplified  backstory so Williams can find himself after losing his wife. Pretty damned offensive given the possibilities. I predict that someone will do this story (or something like it) well sometime before I die. It's just too rich, and we do have some bright minds available. Its just not these two kids."
"While the acting is good, the story is hardly likely and contains inconsistencies. Will's mathematical ""proofs"" are really ""solutions"" to problems. The writers clearly know nothing of their subject matter, and have failed to consult sufficiently in an area outside their expertise. Furthermore, the ""psychological"" side of the story is simple and really contains nothing new or interesting (basically, it's the story of a normal guy who's had some issues in his life, who reads avidly and has a great interest in math, yet somehow does not even know the names of the theorems he makes use of in his ""proofs""). Wishful thinking from people with little to no background in science, and ignorant enough to believe that Will's level of knowledge is possible without study. I put this movie on the same level as ""The Girl Next Door"": an adolescent movie whose entertainment value is due primarily to the distraction in provides."
"Oh please.  What was the hype with this movie? It was yet more formulaic, contrived, saccharine, vacuous tripe.Many comments seem to refer to how 'moving' it was - a reference to the film's overly effusive pouting.  What ever happened to subtlety?And why go for such 'authentic' language in such an unrealistic film which never gains any credibility outside something being shot in a Hollywood studio?And this features so highly on the top 250 list??? Ye gods, watch some films which manage to genuinely convey some emotions a little closer to the world we live in."
"I don't know.  I just can't get into a film when three fourths of the way into it (actually all the way to the end of it) I wouldn't have cared one way or another if the main character stepped in front of a speeding bus. Matt Damon's character was so unlikeable that I stopped caring what was going on in the movie.  The same year that this movie came out, Jack Nicholson made me care about an unlikeable character in As Good As It Gets. Matt Damon couldn't do that for me."
"After I watched the movie, I thought the message board of IMDb is already filled with the comments that how Minnie Driver is naturally beautiful or how her acting in this movie was fantastic. But, WTF? everybody put the negative comments about her or how ugly she is, and some people even said that she was totally miscasted. IMO, I seriously doubt that she was miscasted. Although I admit she is not the most beautiful woman in the world, she is incredibly beautiful in a very natural way, and I'm sure that the none of the Hollywood actresses could have gave a performance like she did in this film. It's little sad that the most of people only care about actresses' looks.Anyway, the movie was just great as I expected. Every single actor/actress did a great job in the film, and I still can't believe Mat and Ben wrote a whole script of the movie. It seems to me that the best part of this movie might be Minnie Driver's acting, her lovable character was definitely one of the kind, and I might be disappointed if they used a typical Hollywood actress instead of her.Is it worth to watch this movie? Yes, abso-freaking-lutely Yes!"
"This awful movie made a lot of money, but that doesn't mean it was good, as a matter of fact it was excruciating. Yet another over rated movie that was simply painful and boring to watch. This story is so preposterous, poorly acted it makes me crazy. This is an insult to cinema goers,with Robin Williams playing the same character he did in Dead Poets Society, Awakenings and Patch Adams and for that alone it is just plain despicable. No other film was as clich√©d and pathetic as this was. I cannot remember a film so pointless and laughable as this dreadful movie was. In a year of so many horrible films, this was the worst excuse for a film I can think of. This film was so torturous I cannot put it into words. I detested every second. I am mad that I wasted my life by seeing this idiotic film. That is when you know a movie is bad.And to top it off Robin Williams Stole Burt Reynolds Oscar (Boogie Nights)"
"*POSSIBLE EARLY FILM SPOILERS*After watching this movie, I plan to file suit against Damon & Affleck to get my two hours back.The characters are thoroughly unrealistic; never in my life have I met anyone who was anything like these people. Damon is thoroughly unconvincing as either a genius or a blue-collar working stiff, and certainly not as a combination of the two. Affleck is completely script dependent yet again, portraying one of his weakest characters yet. And Williams is at his worst.Please, Robin, stick to comedy and playing psychopaths, that's what you're good at. Not ""serious"" drama.But the sad thing? It's pretty obvious that neither Damon or Affleck took much college-level math. That first problem Will Hunting solves in the hallway can be done with just graph theory, combinatorics, and a little linear algebra. The first problem was trivial; anyone with some discrete math background should be able to solve it. Please, aspiring screenwriters, don't underestimate your audience. You never know who might be watching."
"What is it about this movie that people like so much? It is just a two-hour cliche, and a stiflingly boring one at that. It is essentially just a badly done and more obnoxious version of Little Man Tate or Searching for Bobby Fischer. However, the thoroughly average Matt Damon takes the part of the astounding misunderstood genius to a new level. Why? Because, get this: he's... older! Wow! What a twist! That makes it totally different!The only bright spot of this movie is Robin Williams who was cast in the sadly stagnant role of the person who just wants to help our little genius, just as Jodie Foster did in Little Man Tate, or Laurence Fishburne in Searching for Bobby Fischer. Then, we have Stellan Skarsgard in the role that Dianne Wiest and Ben Kinglsey played in the aforementioned films: the academic who is vilified for their attempts to help the genius realize his squandered potential.The only difference that this movie has from the other two I've mentioned is that the misunderstood genius is more independent and gives the establishment a lot of grief. Yeah, Will! Damn the man! Steal an idea! Take Little Man Tate, make him 10 years older and pretend it's a whole new movie!
Number 28 in the top 250? What is the world coming to?"
"Good Will Hunting is a story about a genius who for various reasons has not been able to take advantage of this and, when we are introduced to him in the film, is working as a cleaner at a university. This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsg√•rd. And it goes from there.I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more ""experimental"" movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be: A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake: It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive: Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America: World Police. ""MATT DAMON!"". Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting."
"This movie was so boring. My friend and I had a marker fight in the back of the theater, we were so bored. Usually, I love anything Robin Williams is in. While I liked his performance, the rest of the actors and the movie, by definition blew. The plot was slow, the character development was slow. Everything was slow and boring. I am so glad I didn't pay for it, because I would have demanded my money back. I cant remember the last time I ever wasted two hours. I only went because I had a free pass. I am infinitely glad that Damon and Affleck haven't written anything so rampantly horrible since. One good thing about it was, that it cant get much worse than that, and their future attempts can only get better, cant they?"
"Good Will Hunting could have been an average movie, but it's nothing more than a ($%#)... bad movie. there is nothing you can relate to, it is full of cliche's ... Mat Damon is an awful actor (may be acceptable in some C-production 'hi-school-reunion-kids-got-drunk-movie'). screenplay... well he had an idea... initially - when he was (they were) around page 2 or 3 of the script... and than he took a $4.95 or so 'Screenplay for dummies'... if he didn't do that - this may be almost average movie. this way it is AWFULL and overrated... Robin Williams... Robin... oh the guy who acts 'dead poet's society' each time he sees the camera? even if it is the camera in the K-Marts.... don't mention it"
"Putting aside the tiresome word-play in the title, the main character seems anything but 'good' ... he just seems like a smug, arrogant little pr*ck! He's almost insufferable as he poses for close-ups under perfect lighting and blows puffs of smoke in the direction of the camera.We know he's clever because he does mathematical formulas on the bathroom mirror in a bar ... yawn.It seems highly unlikely that a college professor would have any influence on a courtroom's judgement. To me it was an unlikely and rather weak plot twist.He is then trotted before an array of therapists whom he tries his best to irritate ... why? If he's so clever why would he harm his chance of being kept out of jail; it makes no sense whatsoever. Just for the sake of having an attitude problem that can be unfurled in the course of the story... does this make it edgy?Then he comes across Robin Williams' character and, gee ... do you think they'll end up as friends who change each others lives in some profound way? Gosh I just don't know.Following is a parade of over-the-top dramatics and character evaluations that really become tiresome as everyone's sob story unfolds.It skips across academic topics like the synopsis of a ""for dummies"" book: the most basic snippets of knowledge thrown in here and there. ""Next week we'll be talking about Freud ..."", oh please! Was it the first day of Psyche 101?Why was Affleck's character sitting in some sort of job interview? So random. The chemistry between Damon and Minnie Driver was non-existent. Williams and Driver were good in this, but with such a dismal script ... they did what they could.I don't think this film has aged very well at all, and I'm truly baffled about why this amateurish dramatic for the sake of it production has been so overrated."
"I'm amazed that this spume ever got close to winning an Oscar. It only goes to show that no matter how great the accolades or how high the rating you can still end up watching the most appalling drivel, dressed up as some kind of worthwhile exercise in entertainment. Bulls balls, last night I watched ""in Bruges"" and it was very good, a million miles away from this Oscar winning (substitute prohibited word).OK so now I must get down to a serious criticism of the movie, based on twenty five minutes and twenty seven seconds, after which I couldn't stomach it any more. Where do I start? Hollywood in its purest form is a place (a fantasy) where we are taken and everything is wonderful. But this kind of Hollywood is just a pretend world which is not real and not uplifting either, it neither corresponds to an ideal or a real, it is just pap. It is a depressed fantasy of a reality that never existed. The idea that you have a genius cleaning a college corridor and filling out maths equations on a blackboard, and then having a verbal fist fight with a student at a bar by quoting lots of long words and phrases at him, which will really impress the girl at the bar with the English accent is just so lame, why would anybody think that that was cleaver. Is this film just patronising uneducated but intelligent people or what, I don't know. I give up."
"Oh no. This is such a bad movie. It is so boring! I don't need movies with explosions but this movie needs one, bad. I mean nothing is interesting in GWH. I fell asleep in the theatre looking at this and my friend had to wake me up in the end. Go see this if you are suffering from insomnia, I promise you will fall asleep. One thing is good, that it's not as long as Titanic, you needn't suffer for that long."
"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck shine in a film full of shining moments. There seemed to be very little wrong with this film, and it is a shame the Oscar committee decided to pass on this film as the best of 1997. Not only were Will and Chuckie endearing characters, every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. Even Minnie Driver proved she could fit in her role as Skylar. This film also introduced me to Stellan Skaarsgard, who I think is a very underated actor. A great follow-up of `To Die For' from director Gus Van Zant."
This movie is very very silly. The worn-out concept of the enfant terrible is mixed with the even more worn-out concept of boy-genius in this pretentious flick by a group of people who ought to know better.
"Why in the world was this movie made?  Why was the script written?  The writers obviously wanted to showcase their command of four-letter words, but they apparently had nothing else on their minds.This has to be one of the most totally empty-headed movies I've ever seen. The plot - if it can be called that - was both pointless and ridiculous. The acting involved getting a bunch of immature people to sit around calling each other names.  I can't imagine ever recommending this movie to anyone."
"This movie reeks of one thing....pure arrogance. The film communicates a very immature view on intelligence and success. Are we supposed to accept that since Ben Affleck's character isn't as smart as Matt Damon's, he should be satisfied with his lot in life where as Mr. Smarty Pants should claim his rightful place in the heirarchy of society? So, when some dumb kid sees this movie, he's suppost to say to himself, ""You know, I'm not as smart as Will. I'm more like his friend. So, I really shouldn't worry about succeeding in life. Like Ben Affleck's character, I should be happy working construction while my smart friend needs to get motivated and succeed."" Granted, the movie does not focus on this, but this theme is definitely present, and extractable. By the way, the math that genius Will does is quite simple. Matrices? MacLaurin series? come on. I learned that in high school and I'm no genius."
"Within fifteen minutes, one knew how it going to end. Lacking any real narrative suspense, the film then could only be appreciated on a scene to scene basis. Furthermore, I couldn't bring myself to worry about someone with a 170 I.Q. I believe the film would have been much more interesting had it focussed on the Ben Affleck character"
"It's a good movie; the premise is its best point, as well as the human connection between friends and relationships, but so many reviews on here calling this a masterpiece or one of the best movies ever made are way unwarranted and over the top. It's a good low budget movie with some depth and a famous role for Robin WIlliams, who won the best supporting actor Oscar. The script is good, but not great, the directing is slightly above average, it drags at times, and some little aspects of it are unrealistic. It's definitely good and worth a watch, but it's not one of the greats of all time.8/10"
"This is trite, formulaic rubbish. Why people find this so entertaining is quite beyond me. The writing is immature at best. I read an early draft online and it actually contained an old, and not particularly funny, joke which clearly was going to be passed off as original material before someone obviously stepped and edited it out of the script. For me that says it all. Little imagination, laughably hackneyed worn out characters and a plot with more holes in it than a sieve.We are expected to swallow the fact that he knows more about law, history, mathematics and English literature than the 'experts' we are haplessly presented with in these various fields. OK but how on earth does he achieve this from the public library while holding down a full time job and apparently cultivating lasting friendships with the ne'erdowells with whom he associates, relationships, we are also expected to believe led him regularly into trouble with the authorities?Anyone who knows the 'genius fallen by the wayside' scenario in real life knows only too well that there is never a happy ending. There is no sweet little Robin Williamsesque professor just waiting in the background to help him through it all. It is just painfully stupid Hollywood fluff, he even gets the girl. The only thing he doesn't do is ride off into the sunset on a white horse. I think it was actually a car."
"If you are crazy about the word *uck, you will love this movie because that is predominantly going to be all that you will hear.  Oh, and the scene with Minnie Driver in the bar giving her blow job joke is Oscar material. Puh-leeze!"
"I got dragged to see this movie and i knew i was in trouble in the first few minutes of the film. A seemingly average guy working as a janitor is really a gifted, brilliant, but troubled young man.I hated this stupid movie so much, that i hoped Damon's character in Saving Private Ryan would be captured by the germans and tortured to death."
"Good Will Hunting is a very solid and quiet film. I just finished watching it for the second time on DVD and was more impressed by the screenplay than I was the first time. I thought the first time I saw the film it was only Van Sant's direction that held it all together. The movie is just well written and well directed. I think the casting was good, although I don't think Ben Affleck does a very god job in this film. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, although a big part of me still thinks it belonged to Robert Forster for Jackie Brown. Matt Damon is very good in the lead role. I particularly like the scene toward the end when Matt and Robin's character's open up. The emotion is overwhelming and that is some great acting. The rest of the cast is good too, and Gus Van Sant's direction is powerful. Great movie."
"Overall, I think this movie is good but perhaps a little overrated. I'll talk about everything else later but the biggest issue everyone overlooks is the supposedly ""difficult"" math problems Professor Lambeau assigns at the beginning of the movie. The first problem has four parts which involve finding an adjacency matrix, a new matrix after 3 walks in G, and generating two functions for walks. To be fair, the average moviegoer wouldn't know what the problem is about, but it would be no problem for a graduate-level math student. The second problem asks for the number of trees with n labeled vertices and to draw all homeomorphically irreducible trees with n = 10. An undergraduate student who has taken discrete math and/or graph theory would be able to solve this problem as well. The extra attention to detail of assigning the class a genuinely difficult problem for a graduate- level mathematics course would've given the film more credibility, without feeling like it was ""dumbed down"" for the general movie-going audience.I'll briefly mention everything else: Robin Williams is the best part of the movie; he turns in a strong, versatile performance and is the only likable character. Matt Damon's acting is also great but his character is (for me personally) so abrasive and hard to sympathize with, despite his tragic past. The first 30-40 minutes dragged for me and I felt almost half of that section could have been cut. Once the movie gets going, its pretty engaging and there are a couple genuinely emotional scenes. If you're curious about checking it out, don't be discouraged. It might sound like I'm saying a lot of bad things about it, and even though its not perfect, its worth seeing at least once."
"Released in 1997, I finally had my first viewing of Good Will Hunting this week. It's the best film I've seen in ages.Featuring a great cast consisting of the late great Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Stellan Skarsg√•rd and the Affleck brothers. Good Will Hunting was a simple film that offered a lot. It had a bit of everything, some very nice relationships amongst characters which was great drama and at times extremely funny. The film flows at a good pace which kept me interested all the way through, the story was intriguing as I really related to the characters well.There were plenty of good laughs throughout the film as well as some truly memorable scenes packed with emotional punch, mostly from the meetings between Sean & Will, the way their relationship developed was full of heart. My favourite scene has to be the ""farting wife"" scene, absolutely hilarious and made even better when I found out after that it was improvised, Robin was so funny that even the director was laughing, making the camera shake during that particular scene.Overall a truly memorable film that I certainly hope to watch again & again. Highly recommended.""If you ever disrespect my wife again I will end you. I will *beep* end you. You got that, chief?"" - Such a memorable scene/quote. Brilliant.10/10."
"Well, for all of you out there who love the F word and MF, this movie is for you.   For anyone who desires a storyline, this one is quite minimal.  Who wants to hear the F word for a whole movie?  If cursing as well as a bonus of bad actors is a movie to you, then see it.  The ironic thing is that I don't mind cursing in a movie so long it's to prove a point; but in this movie, it was meant to be simply crude and I saw no point in it.The story seemed to open up with a reasonable plot, but went nowhere.  I suppose it went downhill the more I saw a preppy type of guy claimed to be a genius, yet making idiotic decisions in life.  I'm sorry, but I just can't even imagine Matt Damon as any sort of a genius.  (sheesh, even the size of his vocabulary is obviously limited to curse words only)The reason so many people like this movie has to be because of the big name actors.  What teenage girl doesn't want to see Matt Damon?  Of course, when he's a main actor in a movie, girls go crazy for him as well as Ben Affleck. With such ""good looking guys"", what girl wouldn't go crazy for it?The bottom line for this movie is that it's horrible and should realistically be rated NC-17 for the language let alone the horrible acting."
"I went with my wife to see this in the theater. When the plot failed to go anywhere after an hour, we left.I finally read the entire script, and haven't changed my opinion. Why should I care that this guy is throwing his life away? If he can't stay out of trouble, they should have just thrown him in jail. End of movie.0 stars out of 4."
"I'm aware of the significance of this movie in bringing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to prominence not only as actors but as screenwriters and watched it with a degree of expectation. However the story of Damon's rebellious, tortured working-class genius flowering in the rarefied hot-house atmosphere of Boston's Harvard University didn't quite engage me, despite some good acting.The story is implausible in the extreme, as Damon's gifted character shyly but deliberately puts himself forward to get noticed by answering a difficult mathematical problem on display in the halls of the university and then follows his difficult progress to self- awareness which he ultimately achieves through encountering burn-out been there-done that psychologist Robin Williams and a pretty but feisty Anglophile student, played by Minnie Driver.I was entertained by the movie but felt its mix of low comedy (profanity is frequent, especially when Damon gets down with his gang of fellow low-lifes which includes best mate Chuckie, played by Affleck) with heightened psychological drama didn't always convince. Naturally, Damon gets off to a frosty start with last-resort Willams and even more naturally they open up to each other before the tears really flow in one of the movie's well signposted climaxes further down the line. Ditto the obvious conclusion too when Damon finally lets his heart rule his head.It's well acted although at times it seems pretty stagy, with lots of male-bonding and man- hugs on board. Damon is believable as the gifted misfit but overdoes the angst at times. I didn't quite get Affleck as the goofy sidekick and got the impression he was cast for the part because he wrote it. Williams is good as the broken-down professor but his winsomeness and adoration of his deceased wife grate a bit by the end, Spencer Tracy he's not and while Driver is okay in her part, I didn't really feel the attraction between her and Damon..In the end, while the film engaged me enough, it did seem to me somewhat overrated and didn't quite take me fully on Will's journey to rehabilitation and spiritual redemption."
"I was just starting to write stories, scripts, in my spare time. I wanted to get the form down, so for me, just writing was an exercise in itself. I was putting together a rather simple, down and out story nothing special. Writing in early 97'. I had heard a story on how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had put this script together and had 'shopped' it all over Hollywood and were both kind of ready to sell it, even for a 'piece of chicken' (Jokingly they said in an interview) but they were sort of at their wits'-end when....- it finally happened.Then, look what happened...2 Oscars, 16 other awards and 34 nominations on top of that! Why? Two reasons I can find. First off, they did not give up, or give in to the temptation to finally quit. The other, and this is just a 'shot in the dark' but, the movie was victorious. No, arguments can truly take solid ground against the film, other than yes, they had an affinity for the 'F'-word. These 'Southies' were really playing the 'streeters' of Boston to steely perfection. They were who they set out to be in their writing. I was amazed, this story touched deeply. they showed the struggle and the belief in and they all sort of had a love for their 'Brilliant' janitor friend, knowing that he is destined for more than they were going to encounter in life. And they still stood up for him and with him on everything from street fights to getting him in the end to embrace what he needed to do and follow and not fear the great task ahead of him. The biggest thing for me in this story is the element of distrust, that came from Matt's Character. He was abused by his dad and through that impact that started the massive down-slide (avalanche) of destructive behavior and thoughts of uselessness in himself. He was almost brought to a place that he might not return, as he didn't feel that he could love or give anything to Skyler, because he was scared of love itself. What should have been there at his childhood home (love) was abandoned to an evil overlord that was nothing more than a 'liability' to his life and personal growth. His biological father became a 'bully' worse than any kid at school on the playground. They even brought back some classic seventies tunes that I had forgotten for years, I enjoyed the way that they, placed the music in the different sequences, it was just right. To boot, Matt's character needs to keep the !! Skylar loved him, and he would eventually learn to love other than what he had known before, new and more openly. When the movie ended I was no less than blown away. As a matter of fact I got scared. I was so intimidated, that I stopped writing. Than I heard about the Oscar wins. Robin's first I think it was. And the other wins and nominations and I thought, after a while later, if I quit, I may miss having something to offer to my friends and family, maybe even this country. So I looked at their example and remembered what I took away from the movie and put it back together again for myself. This one is an inspiration all around. This was a winner through and through! It may have been crass and vulgar and just slightly violent, but that just identified the plot of the story as it got going.They deserved every award that they received. This goes beyond just movie for me, it's not as some have been merely entertainment, but it strikes me like life does sometimes, even when God wants to get through to us. We just need to listen and then do the 'right' thing. But we have to follow through for anything good to happened. I recommend this Gus Van Sant, directed and gifted film highly.

"Good Will Hunting was written by Matt Damon for a film class in college. At the time, he did not even think he had put all of his potential to use. Despite this, Matt Damon crafted this masterpiece, and it fittingly marks the beginning of his very successful film career. Will Hunting is a genius who seemingly has misused his talents. It seems he is not motivated to pursue his talents and instead takes a carefree method of going about life. He often is getting in trouble and is surrounded by the wrong kinds of people. It turns out Will is facing a problem much deeper than lack of interest, which requires the help of a therapist (Robin Williams). Will Hunting's chemistry with Robin Williams defines the rest of the film. The genius of Will Hunting is clearly present but it never shines due to his psychological problems. His relation with his therapist allows Will to develop as a character, which is particularly nice to see. The film is shot really well with some emotional scenes. Even though the character of Will Hunting is portrayed as a difficult person to deal with, I was able to connect well with the character and his growth. As with his later movies, Matt Damon was saved against insurmountable odds. However, here is saved psychologically from his traumatized past. Good Will Hunting surely saves Matt Damon just as he begins his remarkable Hollywood career."
"I'd saved this for a special day when I wanted quality. Shame. Completely bizarre and unrealistic story. So contrived and stupid. It wasn't remotely believable. Just silly. The point of the entire frame was to get Matt Damon and Robin Williams in the same room. They could've saved so much time shortening it. The rest was just transport. Everything about the kids life was uninteresting. The silliest sob story. His relationship with the Harvard girl was a yawn-fest. Bad acting. I'm a liberal, so they were preaching to the choir, but even I found the long liberal speeches a bore. People don't talk like that. There's a rule in fiction... show don't tell. They forgot that rule. How did this film get nominated for nine Oscars, including best picture?!? This is first year English major level of writing. So bad dialogue. Such a weak contrived script. It tries to make some blindingly obvious points about it sucking to be poor. This is not news. Also... everybody was hot and sexy with a smoking hot body. Not believable at all. Just took me right out of it. Both me and my girlfriend sat with dropped jaws wondering how this got so high ratings. The good acting does not save this film. Yes, there's some top notch fine acting here. Both Matt Damon and Robin Williams to stellar performances. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who I know is a good actor, couldn't save his silly role. Such a stupid idea for a film. I do not understand this films greatness"
"I first saw this movie when it came out in the cinema and enjoyed it. Then I saw it again today on TV and was dismayed at much I had apparently been sucked in by the Hollywood hype:  two kids write the screenplay, star in it as well, it's an utterly brilliant film and gets an Oscar -- and I fell for it hook, line and sinker.  OK, I will let this be a lesson to myself.  The way I see it today is that it is a well - executed film, but the story is pure drizzle.  Not just non - academic yob turns out to be talented, that would have been a realistic premise and could have made for a likeable movie.  But not good enough for Hollywood -- instead it has to be a janitor at the MIT, and of course he is a gazillion times more brilliant than the professor (who is of course a field - medal - aspiring genius in his own right) of the very building he is working in.  Hold on, I'm not finished. And this dude is also a genius in other areas, at least enough so to impress the judge with his legal cognizance, and he can quote lengthy passages out of philosophy books and he's into organic chemistry just for kicks, and he is a total fire - fighter - cute hunk as well, and he's good at fisticuffs too, and he wins the heart and hand of this super - intelligent, cute and rich chick who turns out to have a heart of gold and is the only one to accept him for what he really is, but he has got this problem facing his own genius because he would rather continue his squalid life of petty crime and dead - end jobs (hey, don't we all?), but then this brilliant psychiatrist who looks ten times more like Sigmund Freud than the man himself comes to the rescue, and -- totally unexpected -- things tie up to a happy end. HOW ON EARTH COULD I EVER HAVE FALLEN FOR THIS CRAP?  Did Hollywood temporarily lobotomize me?  Please, someone, shoot me!OK, the bottom line:  highly forgettable film.  End of bottom line."
"I must say I really found this film very over-rated. First of all the story isn't even remotly credible. How can a street kid without any education solve mathematical puzzles that even professors at Harvard University can't work out ??? Albert Einstein is mentioned several times in the movie as a parallel to Will Hunting, but don't forget that Eintein said, that to become a genius, you need 2% inspiration and 98% transpiration. What makes it even worse is that Will not only masters mathematics but history, literature, chemistry etc. as well. To me, Will is much too much of a Superman, and I couldn't identify with him in ny way. I really believe that you have to strive hard to obtain knowledge and education, and the genius myth that lies behind this film I find totally ridiculous."
"I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I dispise math. Maybe I'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved ""American Beauty"", but that was it. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I'm missing something in this movie, please E-mail me. I am curious why this is on the top 250. And don't say ""Because it was a good movie"".2/10"
"I wanted to like this movie-- and did like a few minor elements of it-- but my enjoyment was greatly overshadowed by my overwhelming distaste with Damon's insanely unbelievable self-aggrandizement.Sorry, no one is a 'genius' in all fields, including the fields that he hasn't even studied! What, he got the info by osmosis? Telepathy? When did he find the time to read up on every subject in existence?The film did have a few things I liked-- I liked Robin Williams' character; and I liked the academic environment. This movie might possibly have worked if they didn't go so ridiculously, ludicrously overboard. If they had made Damon's character even a halfway believable ""genius"", this might have possibly worked. But gee, one of the writers just happens to make his character into the greatest genius in Earth's history. How self-indulgent is that?"
I have never believed for a minute that Matt and Ben really wrote enough of this script to win an Oscar each. I get the feeling it really was the encouragement award not the Best Original Script award. I hope time proves me right and it is revealed that several other experienced ghost writers added the plot turns and the odd funny quip. I think it is primarily cursed with swearing and lazy characterization and it basically does not make sense. If Will is such a genius why can't he work out that behaving like a completely obnoxious idiot won't get him anywhere? etc...I agree with most of the criticisms on this site and place it gently in the bin for Movie Psychotherapy For American Audiences Who Need Movies To learn How To Behave.
"Good Will Hunting is a great film.  It brings, heart, good (and bad) nature, and many other things in this tale of a janitor at MIT who is terrific at math.  This man Will Hunting (played remarkably by Matt Damon) has many flaws though, and soon, he meets his match- Sean, a psychologist (Robin Williams gives a well deserved Oscar winning performance here) and little by little, starts to change.  The way the film shows us Will , Sean and the supporting characters is spectacular and nothing is funnier than a Boston accent.  Great all around."
"Don't spend the entire time while you read this review catching my mistakes and defaming me. It won't change anything. I have an IQ of 140. Not extraordinary, but not so bad either. This is how intelligent people are represented in our society. Every film one sees about this subject touts the virtues of the retard, and deprecates and misrepresents the smart. The ultimate example of this stuff, The Mighty, last year's film starring Sharon Stone tells the story of her son (in the movie), who is a sickly boy who will soon outgrow his bones. His organ will be too large for the space between the bones and he'll die. And he does. The only mitigating factor is that he meets a boy his age who is all muscle and no brains. Together with this boy Stone's son can get about. It's like the old joke ""Well, I'm the bum whole and if I shut down operations, you'll all be in torture, including you stupid brain! This movie Good Will Hunting is like so many movies from the kind of people who have given us things like child protection services, repressed memories suits, the abuse excuse in court, etc. America lives in an orgy of equalization, destroying everything and anything that looks better, let along outstanding. In a word intelligent people are all inbalanced and a constant problem. Only a mildly retarded social worker can help them."
"Twenty-year old Boston `southie' Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is madly charismatic and absolutely intelligent and understanding, but is, at the same time, a loose cannon; a roughneck-psychopath who lashes out at the nearest target.  And while that may be the stark, conflicting, didactic point the film is making, it also serves as its weakest element.  So what if he `finds himself' at the end by hugging Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) ¬ñ he's still a presumptuous and brazen maniac with severe psychological problems (and a societal mutineer that's half humanitarian, half dipsomaniac).  I don't think he especially meets his match in McGuire ¬ñ he just gains a friend with a solid foundation that only points part of Will in the right direction. Hunting has a photographic memory (he's like Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character without the autistic disorder, or Little Man Tate), and can solve problems that only frustrate Nobel Prize winning mathmaticians.  Eventually, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau (Breaking the Waves' Stellan Skarsgard), who saves him from a jail sentence, and he is introduced to McGuire.  Now, Robin Williams is one of my all-time favorites, but I didn't like him at all in this film ¬ñ he plays the role far too cutesy.  I didn't particularly believe his struggle, his stories or his fleeting tough-guy flash.  He just seemed over-emotional and gooey, downplaying his high-strung energy.  Likewise, he could've been brainier and more quick-witted; more of a match for Hunting (their silent chess-game should have been replaced with a shouting match of facts and figures).  On the other hand, Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and tries to help him, is both absorbing and playful (just as she was in Grosse Point Blank).So I have some objections with the film, but it's still, for the most part, a smart, involving story with good characterization. It's got individual flashes of brilliance within an otherwise predictable story.  Apparently, Damon and Affleck wrote the movie years ago, and finally got to see the project made ¬ñ good for them!  In their defense, the two spin a great underlying theme about the working class, and how straightforward (and thus, romantic) it is to be an unassuming bricklayer.  Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) says it best when he tells Hunting, `You're sitting on a winning lottery ticket -- it would be an insult to us if you're still around here in 20 years.'  I just didn't experience the essential resolution I was, perhaps, supposed to feel by the final frame."
"A rebellious young college janitor (Matt Damon)  is secretly a maths genius, but even when it is uncovered, he seems reluctant to use it to better his life.A film that is billed as ""highly original"" is nothing of the kind. It merely lifts from a wide variety of diverse movies from Saturday Night Fever through Rocky to Love Story.  However it owes more to Ordinary People (the film best remembered - or is it forgotten!? -  for  robbing Raging Bull of the Best Picture Oscar!) than any other.Hard to really believe the central character who seems to have read lots of books and done a lot of studying off-screen (how, why and when are not fully explained). On-screen he seems much more interested in fighting on street corners, shouting at his working class friends (even when they are sat next to him), and getting clever-clever with authority.Good performance from Matt Damon in the central role, but Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who helps him (and who himself ends up helped), is the standout. Here is guy who can say more with a look than most actors can do with a hundreds lines of dialogue. Shame that even the academics seem  to swear just as readily and just as often as those lower down the food chain.Mini Driver is quite touching as an English student (rich - but not a bitch!) who catches our hero's eye. While bringing dimension to the movie, you get the feeling that this was included in case the rest of the plot flopped. It wouldn't take too much editing to make this the central theme with the rest being the background. However this was not needed.Too many good moments and too much of an engaging plot for us not be lightly charmed - but I wasn't moved by this movie. Our hero's working class friends are loyal - but that is about all you can say for them. Ben Affleck (in the ""best friend"" role) shows that haircuts, cheekbones and teeth are still what really counts in tinsel town. The sterile world of (Boston) academia and the juvenile world of the street (as portrayed here) both alienated me. Can there not be middle way for our will-he-won't-he protagonist? The movie seems just as confused on this point as I am and in the end cops out of answering it."
"The constant  profanity jarred rather than added realism, and did little more than distract and make it seem the actors were trying much too hard. Though Will may have been a genius, but the writers sure are not.  The formulas in this film are familiar to any 2nd Year maths student in university.  The performances and direction, however,  are very appealing, turning the cliched and typical plot into an enjoyable film."
