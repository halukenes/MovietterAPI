"It is at a time like this I wish I could expand my vocabulary to better articulate the virtues and qualities of such a fine film. I also find I'm bursting to talk about this film that I regrettably saw alone. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but desperately want to share it with everyone.
The talented star of ""The Legend of 1900"", Tim Roth, presented this film along with Clarence Williams III. His encouragement to the audience was that if anyone was the sort who liked to pick apart at films and critique their lack of realism, they should just leave now. He touted this wonderful vision from the director of Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore, and likened the film to a ""dream"". He also said that if anyone had seen his own film, ""The War Zone"", that ""1900"" was the antidote for it. I was slated to see ""The War Zone"" the next day, but that was fine by me. I managed by a sheer stroke of luck to get into this Canadian premiere and found it to be absolutely extraordinary and the best film I'd seen so far of the Toronto International Film Festival.It seems as though mere moments after the initial credits, that the wonderful storytelling and incredible music combined with stunning visuals almost had me moved to tears. While I'll admit that I'd be seeing films all day, no film in my recollection had such an impact so quickly.The story is one of an abandoned baby who is found on a ocean liner by one of the ship's crew. He is unofficially adopted and named ""1900"" for the year in which he was born. At a very early age the boy demonstrates an extraordinary gift for piano playing which is only strengthened in his passing years. The boy grows up with no official identity, into a man having never taken a step off of the ship onto dry land in his whole life. The young man, played by Tim Roth is encouraged by his dear friend to leave the boat and pursue a life of fame and fortune as the great pianist he has become. 1900 declines, explaining simply that everything he needs is on the boat.Well, that should be enough to intrigue you; there's much more of course, but I've no desire to spoil it for anyone. I must encourage everyone to see this film, I can hardly imagine anyone being disappointed. It's for music lovers, dreamers, romantics and film buffs everywhere and my greatest hope is that it will be seen by many, many people, especially those I know and love. And after seeing the film, and hearing Tim Roth's words echoing in my mind, he was absolutely right. It is like a dream, a wonderful dream that I wished would never end. And for a future prediction, I see this film as a Best Foreign Film Oscar nomination for 1999."
"As its pianist, this film could be bound for success, but the fact is, it remained relatively obscure. I can't understand why did a movie with this deepness and feeling end up in oblivion. Because, if there are some beautiful movies, this is one of them, from the moment that fantastic Ennio Morricone score begins until we witness the tear-jerking finale. An epic story from tip to toe, we journey through the original story of a man who becomes a pianist on board the boat where he was born. And as he grows, so does the fascination by the others in his art and the questions whether he should take that leap overboard and become a ""normal"" person. A brilliant movie, from the man who brought us ""Cinema Paradiso"" and made us all cry, this won't disappoint you, and it's worth by Morricone's score alone. The sequence where the piano floats freely through the dance hall is anthological. A legend of its own."
"This a ""sleeper,"" a very good film few people have heard about. The ones who have reviewed it here obviously know about it and you can see by their comments how well-liked it is.....so if you haven't seen it, check it out. In North America, it's called ""The Legend Of 1900.""The movie is definitely unique, about a man who spends his entire life on board an ocean liner and is a fantastic piano player. The best thing about this film, to me at least, was not the story- which I did enjoy - but the cinematography. Wow, what a great-looking film. Speaking of looks, Melanie Thierry is gorgeous. Too bad she has only a small part in this movie.It was nice to see Tim Roth play something other than a detestable villain and Clarence Williams was fun as the arrogant ""Jelly Roll Morton,"" who comes aboard ship to challenge Roth to a piano duel, which has to be seen to be believed. Can you say ""outrageous?""This was filmed by the same man who did the much more well-known Italian film, Cinema Paradiso, and if you appreciate how good-looking that film is, well, this is even better!"
"On the first day of the twentieth century, an infant is discovered in the coal room aboard a luxury liner. The worker (Bill Nunn) who discovers the child on The Virginian names him 1900 or more accurately Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen-Hundred. Eight years later the boy loses his ""father"" in a ship accident but discovers an amazing ability to play the piano and a legend is born. It is indeed The Legend of 1900, a fable by Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) based on a dramatic monologue by Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco. The story is about a musical prodigy who spends his life aboard a ship, sailing back and forth between the U.S. and Europe, entertaining the passengers with his unique talent but never sharing it with the rest of the world.The film is narrated by Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), an American saxophone player whom we meet at the beginning as he tries to pawn his trumpet. On leaving the shop, however, he hears the only recording 1900 ever made, a master that he had broken into pieces but that was later restored. When he finds out that the master came from a ship about to be demolished, he rushes to save 1900 whom he is sure is still aboard. In the process, he tells his story to convince others that 1900 exists. Through flashbacks we learn about 1900 and how he navigated his life from stem to stern. The question throughout the film is whether or not 1900 will abandon the ship and set foot on land? There is a hint that he might do so after he meets a beautiful young woman (Melanie Theirry). She inspires him to compose a beautifully expressive love song while gazing at her through a window, but the only thing that remains is the last copy of the record and an enduring memory.The Legend of 1900 creates its own world and I confess it is one that I got lost in. This is a lovely film that has a heart. It is sentimental without question but is redeemed by the glorious music by Ennio Morricone, beautiful cinematography by Lajos Koltai, and a terrific jazz piano duel between the adult 1900 (Tim Roth) and Jelly Roll Morton played by Clarence Williams III. 1900's world has clearly defined limits and he is fearful of venturing beyond. Land represents for him a place without boundaries, where people can get lost, a place without beginning or end. To me, The Legend of 1900 may be a metaphor for people who find a comfortable niche for themselves in life and are afraid to take risks to see what the possibilities are. In many cases, as with 1900, the world will never know the contribution they might have made."
"This movie was given to me as a Christmas gift in 2004. My friends know my love of ships and movies, so they knew this would be something I was surely to like. And did I. I would have been deeply disappointed if I had seen this at the local CinePlex, because there are so many excellent scene's you will want to rewind an ponder over, even shed a tear or two. Its the story of a baby boy ( Tim Roth )who is found aboard an ocean liner( by actor Bill Nunn ), who spends his entire life aboard this ship. Its a movie that is wonderfully acted by all the cast. It moves with ease an always keeps you in a slight fog that lifts at the perfect moment. The piano score's are exquisite !!!I found it haunting and moving at the same time. This movie is 2 hours long, but it will glide by so quickly you will want for more. Without spoiling it, the ending scene is powerful, its..............well......I'll let you be the judge. Enjoy, Marco"
"After seeing this movie I went straight to my video store to buy their copy. Unfortunately, they had only the one copy and wouldn't sell it to me. This movie affected me deeply. It tells the story of a musical prodigy who is born, lives his entire life, and dies on board a cruise liner. The scene where the pianist, named 1900, and his friend ""ride"" the grand piano around the ballroom as the ship rolls brought me to tears. There is a palpable joy in this scene : captivated by the music, they care not where the piano takes them. And take them it does, through the glass wall of the ballroom and down a corridor where they are confronted by ship's the Captain. He does not admonish the pair, just accepts the situation. When 1900 is challenged by jazz great Jelly Roll Morton to a piano duel, he meets the challenge and annihilates Morton with a performance that left me shaking. I replayed that scene over and over. As a pianist myself, I was entranced, thrilled and amazed by the playing. When 1900 delivers the coup de grace, I literally cheered! You must see this film. It is a very special experience."
"""The Legend of 1900"" wistfully tells its creative, capriciously unpredictable, and musical tall tale with excellence in all aspects of film from sets to sound, costume to casting, and script to screenplay. Roth and Vince work well together in this plaintive, simple story which will captivate those who can make the leap of faith required to ""buy in"". A good film for all but critics, ""Legend"" will likely resonate most with those who equate living with musical expression. La vita Ã¨ musica."
"""The Legend of 1900"" is not the most attractive title for a film and the Italian original, ""The Legend of the Oceanic Pianist"", is no better.  in retrospect there is no title worthy of this film.  The marquee should read simply ""See This Film, Your Life Will Be Better for It.""The story, music, cinematography, direction and, I hazard to say, a near perfect performance by Tim Roth combine to make for a compelling film.  The story is told with a poetic lyricism that is immediately captivating and that is more than enhanced by Lajos Koltai's well stated cinematography. Clarance Williams III's controlled overstatement as an unexpectedly nasty Jelly Roll Morton is the perfect contrast to Roth's underplayed and unworldly 1900.The American release of the film is 125 minutes.  The Italian release was 160 minutes.  What are we missing.  Maybe this shorter cut is better but I cannot forget the devastation that was wrought on ""Once Upon A Time In America"" for its 139 minute US theatrical release.  I certainly would not be not adverse to being subjected to an additional 35 minutes of the film and judging for myself if it was too long.Aside from its title the films only flaw is the exit song.  After two hours of enthralling instrumentals the vocal on the exit song undercuts rather than underscores a masterful filmic experience....rmk"
"What an excellent movie! I usually am partial to stupid comedies like Zoolander and other ""non-greats"" like like Daredevil and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but even I loved this movie! It's a must-see for everyone.My sister wanted to me watch this with her because she had to for a school assignment, and since I know a lot about things she doesn't (i.e., cinematography, costumes, makeup, etc.) she wanted to know my opinion. And, although those other subtle effects were excellent, I couldn't help but notice that this movie, too, was one of the best. I was angry that I had never even heard of it before, let alone not have been nominated for ""Best Picture"" in the 1999 Academy Awards!"
"Not a classic, but whoa, some of that piano playing just sweeps you right off your feet. Tim Roth is good as the handsome pianist Nineteenhundred and so is all the the rest of the cast. This cast also includes Clarence Williams III, presumably the grandson of Clarence Williams (the man who wrote the song ""Basin Street Blues"" one hell of a classic), as Jelly Roll Morton. This leads me on to one of the most impressive parts of the film where Nineteenhundred and Morton have a match to see who is the best pianist. There is some piano playing in this scene which will leave pianists with there mouths hanging open. Probably the best thing about this film is it's music. There are many rousing themes played throughout the film, especially the love theme played while Nineteenhundred kisses a girl he has fallen in love with, a simple yet very effective theme. Another thing that makes this film very good is the fantastic camera-shots, especially one of Nineteenhundred as he stands halfway across the plank which leads him from the boat to New York, undecided whether or not he should leave the boat and head for world-wide celebrity on land, or stay on the boat and remain unknown to anyone but the passengers. I have got to get myself the soundtrack to this film and you have got to see it somehow. Enjoy!"
"If you love films (trust me, you would not have waded through some 200 reviews to get to this one, if you did not) then chances are you have a weak spot for almost-perfect, self-contained, little gems like this that not only leave you with an experience you will never forget but do so without benefit of precedent or facsimile; that is, they don't mimic anything that came before. Even more astounding is that Roth made his bones playing bad guys (which he does superbly) but in this rare film you get to see another side of him, and, who knew, he is at his core an actor's actor, he can play anything, it just happens he found a niche playing heavies. The scene where Roth's character goes one to one with Williams, whose character is Jelly Roll Morton, is one of the best strips of celluloid ever and if you have the ability to stop and replay, don't be surprised if you watch it (and listen to it) more than once. Bravo."
"the more people see it, the more people there are to help me work out what to make of it.  It's hard not to like, and the central conceit, the fantasy story of someone whose entire life is spent crossing and re-crossing the Atlantic, is just delicious - yet there's always something that prevents it from working as it should.  There's too much narration.  Narration aside, there are too many words.  Just before 1900 and the narrator part ways the former explains himself, to some degree, in a longish speech.  The speech was necessary: we needed to hear his reasons from his own lips.  But once it had been given the scene should have ended.  Instead the two characters keep adding postscripts as they walk away from one another - and they're standard, maudlin things which are at odds with what 1900 had been saying a moment ago.  Again and again, there are words where there shouldn't be.But then, it may be that the title character was given too FEW words - at least at first.  Because it's so long before we first hear 1900 express his thoughts verbally (and because in the absence of other information about his character we are unwilling to pass judgment on him until he does) it takes too long for us to warm to him.  In fact we never warm to him as much as we should.And yet there are scenes - the piano duel, the girl in the rain - that are just fantastic, that make me reluctant to criticise anything at all.  Any film containing moments like those can afford to lose its way at times.P.S.  Of course, a film about a pianist born on the first day of the Twentieth Century ought to be called ""The Legend of 1901"", which if you asks me sounds better anyway."
"""I'll never watch another movie again!"" cried my sweet-hearted wife as she wept uncontrollably as the final scene ended. Touched, I wept with her, but made no such vow. She may not keep the vow either, but I can see why she said what she did. This was my second viewing, her first. This time, though, I was deeply touched by everything in the film. 12 years ago, when I first saw it, it was fun, interesting, and for me a real salvation for an actor--Tim Roth--who normally plays the bad guy. Today I can easily say that of the thousands of films I have seen, this one out-ranks all of them--definitely is #1 in my book. I honestly can think of no other great film that is as good. Mary Poppins comes to mind, but still doesn't make the grade like this one. Oh, and we love, love, love Jazz. There's Ragtime here, and Dixieland, and Roaring 20s Jazz, and other Jazz styles--and even quite a bit of Classical. Roger Waters even steps in for one of his classic solos written for this film--and I'm a big Pink Floyd fan because of, you guessed it, their Jazz influence. I've gushed enough, I guess, but see this one, then get a copy for yourself, and watch it once a year--to remind yourself that the inner world, the inner kingdom, is far and away better than anything that world out there has to offer. Anything."
"After the Second World War, the American musician Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince) comes to a pawn shop to sell his trumpet and asks to play one last song with the instrument. The shopkeeper (Peter Vaughn) puts an old record with the same song to play, and Max asks him where he found it since it is an unreleased unique song. He tells that he bought a piano from a scrapped ship and found the pieces of the record inside the piano. Max tells that on January, 1st 1900, the stoker Danny Boodmann (Bill Nunn) of the Steamship ""Virginian"" finds a baby boy over the piano of the first class in a cradle carved T.D. Lemon and he decides to keep the child. He gives the name of Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred and raises the child in the boiler room of the passenger ship. Years later, an accident kills Danny Boodmann and the boy leaves the boiler room for the first time and discovers that he is a natural born pianist. When Max is hired to play trumpet in the ship, he becomes a close friend of 1900 (Tim Roth) and witness his life, including the duel with the arrogant ""man who had invented the jazz"" Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) and when he falls in love for a girl (MÃ©lanie Thierry) and almost leaves the vessel in New York. When Max left the ship on August, 21st 1933, he lost contact with 1900. Now he decides to go to the junkyard and find his missing friend. In the end, a good story worths more than an old trumpet.""La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" is a sensitive, poetic and tragic fantasy about music, missing love and friendship, with magnificent direction of Giuseppe Tornatore; top-notch performances of Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Vince; and haunting music score of Ennio Morricone. The cinematography, costume design and art direction are wonderful and the dialogs are intense and delightful. This film was released in Brazil on VHS in the 90's by Warner, but deserved at least a DVD. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda do Pianista do Mar"" (""The Legend of the Pianist of the Sea"")"
"Well, at the risk of sounding condescending, I am an English jazz pianist who for the past 30 years have worked primarily on cruise ships - some very much like the Virginian. I first saw this movie on cabin TV and it quite literally blew me away, not so much for the whimsical will o' the wisp subject which in itself was haunting and quite beguiling, but for the very reason that I realised to my shock that I had become 1900 in so many ways... least of all that I, like so many other musicians quite simply never got off the ship - anywhere! As for 1900's piano playing - it is incredibly difficult for a non-playing actor to 'mime' to an intricate piece, for example when bass registers are playing, the actor's hands are playing on the top registers! Awful and check out the Tyrone Power Eddie Duchin Story to see how it's not done! Tim Roth had me convinced, even though I knew he wasn't playing... the illusion was perfect. The duel was, despite the predicted outcome... exciting and superbly understated. Fast doesn't mean great but in this case it was. Wihtout doubt one of my favourite films of all time as it is with many of my colleagues in the cruise industry. Whimsical, enchanting, beguiling, poignant and it touches many emotions I hadn't realised I had. I would give it 100 out of 10."
"The story, told by the main character's best friend Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) takes place on the Virginian, one of the luxurious ocean liners of the Titanic-era. It's an epic tale of jazz music, friendship, romance andÂ.magic. A baby boy is found on the Virginian by one of the ship's stokers. He names the boy after the name on the crate he was found in: T.D.Lemon. Since it's the turn of the century, 1900 is added as his surname. Tim Roth is 1900. Or more accurately: Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900. It turns out that 1900 is a special boy. His gift for the piano makes him a legend. But in order to experience the the piano sound of the legendary master, you have to make a cruise because 1900 never sets foot on land!The only one to come close to the way 1900's mind works is his friend and colleague Max, an accomplished trumpet player in the ship's band. As Max puts it: `You're never really done for as long as you got a good story and someone to tell it to'. And boy does he tell a beautiful story. A story that will keep you mesmerized all through the film. There are scenes that will definitely put a smile on your face. For instance the scene when 1900 tries to cure Max from his seasickness by offering him a ride on his piano! And what about the piano duel? Watch this movie and find out for yourself. A heart-warming, touching movie with a touch of magic. Highly recommended."
"Imagine, if you will, a world.  A world where movies have thought provoking premises, eye-popping cinematography, beautiful sets and costumes, and absolutely beautiful music.  Now, take all these positives and combine them with contrived dialogue, blind editing, cliches, and a plot that meanders on a journey to nowhere.  This is the world of The Legend of 1900.I'm a big fan of feel good movies, Disney has made more than one feature film that has ""pulled at my heart-strings,"" yet I found it almost impossible to care about this movie.  Character development never took place, in fact, I'm not sure acting ever took place.  The movie was filled with unrealistic, ""magic"" moments that might have made more sense in a children's fantasy movie.  But this can hardly be considered a children's movie considering the number of times the f-word is used and the feature is too painfully grounded in reality to be considered fantasy.To call the dialogue tin-eared is almost a compliment and though the director is Italian it's not as if he would be unable to hire someone who did have a clue.Speaking of directing, why direct a movie that should be an intimate character study with such an epic style?  The grandeur of the camera angles/movement is impressive until you finally realize that it's there to entertain you through part of the flat plot.As plots go, we never really accomplish anything.  By the end of the movie, I almost felt that I knew less about 1900 than I did at the beginning. And Vince's character, eyes darting about to the point of distraction, gives a horrible performance with a whimp of a character.  Other than serving as 1900's lap-dog and trite narrator he serves no practical purpose whatsoever.The thing that bothers me most, though, is the number of people singing this movie's praises.  Endless reviews calling it ""magic"" and ""unforgettable."" It gives me cause to step back and re-examine my long-held views that people aren't generally idiots.I don't mean to destroy this movie, I simply find myself disappointed.  I had hoped for so much more.  I would love to see this movie redone by a director who knows English and with a script that follows the same plot without the painfull specifics that drive this feature into the dirt. This movie gets a 3/10.  1 for cinematography, 1 for music, and 1 for a concept that had enough potential to make me pick up this movie on a whim."
"It is quite inexplicable to me why many North-American critics and viewers have a visceral negative reaction to sentimental Italian movies. By Italian I don't mean necessarily the language but a certain easily identifiable directorial style. So this category contains movies such as _Il Postino_, _Cinema Paradiso_, _Malena_, but also English language films such as _Stealing Beauty_ and _The Legend of 1900_.What they all have in common, besides beautiful cinematography, is that they try, quietly and modestly but nevertheless ambitiously, to investigate some aspects of the very essence of the human soul. The emotion used by many such movies, especially the ones directed by Tornatore, is nostalgia: by understanding the pain of irrecoverable loss we are supposed to understand what we truly needed. These movies express perfectly HL Mencken's definition of the artist as ""one who observes the eternal tragedy of man with full sympathy and understanding, and yet with a touch of god-like remoteness.""However, for reasons I fail to understand, the unavoidable sentimentality of these movies bothers many critics and casual viewers to no end. It's true that sentimental art exposes itself the most to irony and cynicism, but it is nevertheless disappointing to see many critics taking advantage of its vulnerability and indulging in hitting hard and hitting low against such movies. No wonder that art in general, not only movies, is nowadays almost devoid of sentimentality. Artists choose to clad themselves in critic-proof armors of irony and sophistication. Honesty has long become a dangerous no-win proposition.So I say 'Bravo!' to Tornatore for having the courage to give us some bullshit-free insight into ourselves by showing us what moves us and why. I also say 'Boo!' to the critics who don't get it, and who mistake their expectations and biases for some kind of objective artistic standard."
"He's a man so brave, that he can play the imaginary piano when exploded with the ship he was born, lived and died in. Yet he's a man so scared, that he cannot face the infinite city life we are living everyday. He's a man so intelligent, that he can play the piano as if he has four arms (or I'd rather say, he has God's arms). Yet he's a man so stupid, that he chose to gone with the wind while he's other choice could be marrying a beautiful woman and having a child. He's a man so perceptive, that he could use his music language to describe exactly others' feelings. Yet he's a man so insensitive that he'd rather disappear after a gentle kiss on his beloved while she's asleep than unburden himself and tell her ""ILU"".But one thing is for sure: this man is a real artist--pianist. Only a man like him can dance with the piano in a terrifying storm. Only a man like him can give up the first two bouts of a duel, and beat the competitor entirely, convincingly, potently in the last bout. Only a man like him... can have such a beautiful story to tell...This man is Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred, who is also known as simply ""1900"". A man never existed. He has never set foot on land in his entire life. No ID. No passport. No Visa. No parents. No birthday. Nothing in the world belongs to him except his music.So he played. For the first class guests. For the third class members. For the girl at the window. For the darkness of the night. For the heartbeat of his own. For the sea-- his eternal home.He had once wanted to get off the ship. To meet his girl and to hear the voice of the sea, as he always wanted to. He hugged friends goodbye and waved and went down. But his pace became slower and slower, and finally stopped. As he described at the end of the movie:""Nineteen Hundred: All that city. You just couldn't see the end to it. The end? Please? You please just show me where it ends? It was all very fine on that gangway. And I was grand too, in my overcoat. I cut quite a figure. And I was getting off. Guaranteed. There was no problem. It wasn't what I saw that stopped me, Max. It was what I didn't see. You understand that? What I didn't see. In all that sprawling city there was everything except an end. There was no end. What I did not see was where the whole thing came to an end. The end of the world... Take a piano. The keys begin, the keys end. You know there are eighty-eight of them, nobody can tell you any different. They are not infinite. You are infinite. And on these keys the music that you can make is infinite. I like that. That I can live by. You get me up on that gangway and you're rolling out in front of me a keyboard of millions of keys, millions and billions of keys that never end, and that's the truth, Max. That they never end. That keyboard is infinite. And if that keyboard is infinite, then on that keyboard there is no music you can play. You're sitting on the wrong bench. That's God's piano. Christ! Did, did you see the streets? Just the streets?There were thousands of them! And how do you do it down there? How do you choose just one? One woman, one house, one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at, one way to die... All that world is weighing down on me, you don't even know where it comes to an end, and aren't you ever just scared of breaking apart at the thought of it? The enormity of living it? I was born on this ship, and the world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time. And there were wishes here, but never more than fit between prow and stern. You played out your happiness, but on a piano that was not infinite. I learned to live that way. Land? Land is a ship too big for me. It's a woman too beautiful; it's a voyage too long, a perfume too strong. It's a music I don't know how to make. I could never get off this ship. At best, I can step off my life. After all, I don't exist for anyone. You're an exception, Max, you're the only one who knows I'm here. You're a minority, and you better get used to it. Forgive me, my friend, but I'm not getting off.""He didn't get off. That's what he said and he did. As I mentioned above, he died with the ship, in the explosion. I believe at this point of the movie, no body can hold their tears back.By the way, this movie is Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, who is also the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso and MalÃ¨na. Some people say the legend of 1900 is the director's compromise to Hollywood-style-commercial movie. Well, I know nothing about this kind... It's a excellent movie. Much I could say."
"""The Legend of 1900"" is unique in many ways, the first being that it is an Italian film with English-speaking characters. Tim Roth who has been cast as a villian most of his career does a remarkable job as the adult '1900', the simple man, a gifted piano player, who had a his own particular take on life. The story begins as a ship worker is crawling around the ballroom floor, looking for valuables lost by the wealthy guests, but instead finds a baby. It is the New Year 1900, thus the baby's name. He is raised in the bowels of the ship until at about age 8 or 10 he is noticed playing the piano. He eventually becomes the ship's piano player, and his reputation spreads until Jelly Roll Morton takes a voyage and challenges '1900.'  In the end, he lit his cigarette on the hot piano strings!some SPOILERS - The film actually starts in more modern times as the trumpet player friend of 1900's is selling his horn and telling the 'Legend of 1900' after the shopkeeper shows him a patched-together record of the piano composition that was lost years earlier, parts hidden in the piano. He tells the story in a series of flashbacks, and at the end finds out the old ship has been stripped of all valuables and is to be sunk the next day by dynamite. But he just knows '1900' must still be aboard the ship, because he knew he never could leave. So he borrows the record and a player and goes to every different part of the dilapidated ship, playing the song, hoping to lure out '1900'. Earlier in the film '1900' said, ""My music will never go anywhere without me"" and that is why the master disk never left the ship until the piano, with the broken recods hidden in it, ended up in the shop also.more SPOILERS - '1900' almost left the ship once, he was going to visit NYC and a pretty girl he met, was half-way down the gangplank, suitcase in hand, well-wishers waving goodby, he paused a long time, threw his hat into the water, and went back on the ship. Only years later, as he and his friend spoke in the bowels of the old ship did he explain, ""I looked at the city and could not see an 'end.' A piano has 88 keys, you know where it starts and where it ends. But the city alone has hundreds of miles of streets, how do you know which one to take, which girl to love, which house to buy? I could not see an 'end' so I had to stay on the ship."" And he did, he had become so accustomed to the small, contained world of the ship that he could not cope with the greater world. Even though it is a movie, one second we are seeing '1900' with a smile, musing about heaven, and the next moment a horrific blast. It is hard to not get jolted by the image.At 120 minutes this film requires some patience, and the desire to see good character studies over non-stop action. It is impossible to describe in words how good Tim Roth is in this role. We always knew he could play the bad guy, this film crystallizes his overall talent as one of the best in the business. A remarkable story, a legend, with a remarkable character. A superb film."
"Nostalgic and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . An epic story of a man who could do anything , except be ordinary . Shortly after the Second World War, Max , a transplanted American (Pruitt Taylor Vince) , visits an English pawn shop to sell his trumpet , there meets a shopkeeper (Peter Vaughan) and a peculiar musical single . Then Max tells the tale in flashback after learning a ship has been condemned (there was actually a registered ship named the SS Virginian which was built in 1904 and scrapped around 1954). As an abandoned infant is discovered aboard the luxury liner in 1900 and reared by an engine labourer (Bill Nunn) and the crew . As an adult is nicknamed Novecento (Tim Roth) and he has become an expert pianist , but since 1900 remains an enigma .The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an enjoyable story between a lone pianist and a trumpet player . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay based on monologue Novecento by Alessandro Baricco was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . Magnificent performance from Tim Roth as virtuoso pianist in the ship's orchestra who has superstitiously never set foot off the boat and Pruitt Taylor Vince as his trumpet man friend . Good acting from remaining cast such as Bill Nunn as Danny Boodmann , Clarence Williams III as Jelly Roll Morton , MÃ©lanie Thierry as The Girl , Gabriele Lavia as Farmer and Peter Vaughan as'Pops', the Shopkeeper . Originally released under various titles and at 170 minutes , it was re-cut and still had its problems . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and splendidly photographed by Lajos Koltai who reflects the elegant scenarios .As exterior shots of the ship are the inspired blueprints of the SS Lusitania and her sister ship the SS Mauritania, the ballroom in which 1900 plays his piano in had a dome similar to the dome the SS Mauritania had in her ballroom during the transatlantic period . Rousing and moving score musical by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone who was nominated with a deserved Gloden Globe . The picture was well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore who made similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as the excellent Â¨Cinema ParadiseÂ¨ with Philippe Noiret , Â¨MalenaÂ¨ with Monica Belucci , Â¨ The star makerÂ¨ with Sergio Castellito and Â¨BaariaÂ¨ with Raoul Bova ; being his English-language debut feature titled Â¨The professorÂ¨ with Ben Gazzara . Rating of Â¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" (original title) or ""The Legend of 1900"" or ""The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and wonderful score ."
"I agree with most reviewers: This is a beautiful, poetic film, with an enthralling story, beautiful cinematography, and lovely score. ButÂin the end I found 1900 to be a tragic, flawed character. There was nothing noble in his self-imposed constraint of never setting foot off ship. He came close to leaving the ship but doesn't do so because he was traumatized by the uncertainty of life. His assessment of life was correct: boundaries in life are ill-defined; a person has latitude in how he or she chooses to live their life. A great person is someone who expands their horizons throughout life, who continually seeks more and is willing to take a chance even at risk of failure. 1900, on the other hand, elects to live in a cocoon and prefers to die in his late 40's rather than venture forth. His fear of the unknown resulted in a marginal existence. Except for his ""father,"" he never had any close relationships Â 1900 is detached even from Max. He refused to allow a recording of his music to be released because that would involve the unfamiliar ""outside"" world. He wasn't a sympathetic character for me. The poignancy in this film is that 1900 was someone who could have had a much more meaningful life. I saw the film as a tragedy. Viewed as such, I liked it but it sure was sad to watch."
"First of all, it was nice to see the ship exterior and promenade deck from Fellini's ""And the Ship Sails On"" once more. Every studio should have its own ship, and the one at Cinecitta is lovely. The overall production design and cinematography of this film are a constant delight.That being said, this ship gets lost in fog around halfway through, and never finds its way again. As with so many Italian films, this movie is about the grand gesture, but all too often here the gesture is clumsy, badly written or staged, or totally inexplicable. The ballroom piano recital in the rolling storm is a memorable gesture, the playoff with Jelly Roll Morton is phonus bolognus, the closing self-explanation of the main character's life and his vision of heaven is unbearable. You know something's wrong when, in the opening sequence, a ship filled with immigrants enters New York harbor from the wrong direction, with the Statue of Liberty and the island of Manhattan sliding by in reverse. Did they come in from Albany? Unimportant in itself, this howler shows an autointoxicated disregard for truth in the pursuit of gripping but often unmotivated emotion. This self-indulgence kills the whole film. We are told that Truth is Beauty and Beauty is Truth, but in this movie, one of them is a liar."
"Cutesy and pointless, there's little to recommend about this ponderous film besides the Ennio Morricone score and Clarence Williams III's performance as Jelly Roll Morton (expect that he's trapped in a dueling-pianos sequence that just seems to go on forever).Tim Roth tries valiantly, but his performance is hampered by the fact that he has no character to play; his ""1900"" is more a labored metaphor than a human being, and there's little this talented actor can do with the weak script (which occasionally has painful bouts of English-as-a-second-language-itis.But hey, I didn't like ""Cinema Paradiso"" either, so what do I know..."
"This is a movie that will have you thinking about it for a long time after it's finished. It's a unique story, very well written. The cinematography is wonderful. But the soundtrack is enchanting, it takes you somewhere beautiful. There's something romantic about ocean liners of the day & this film captures this wonderfully. Tim Roth is so right for this part, he captures the innocence of someone who has never stepped foot on land, but has a keen sense of people's personalities. The rest of the cast was carefully picked. The Piano duel between 1900 (Tim Roth) and Jelly Roll Martin (Clarence Williams III) is one of the big highlights of the film. The scene that has him recording a song on board the ship while he watches the beautiful Melanie Thierry is poignant. It's right up there with Amadeus. You must buy this film & the soundtrack"
"This movie has classic moments, cinematic to their core. One of those special and masterful cases where the musical score is the story, as if the screenplay was built arround the music. One of Morricone's best. Full of magical situations made for cinema and cinema only. At times the music takes over the visuals, as to the very powerful minimalism of a face of a woman backed by exquisite and subtle piano piece, to the other extreme, of compelling and dynamic visuals which move with the music, as when the whole ship rocks in the middle of a storm, while the pianist frenetically plays a full sized tail piano rolling across the ballroom, talk about rock and roll!!! Pure magic!"
"Unlike the perverted friendship depicted in the (in)famous Brokeback Mountain, the Legend of 1900 is about two men bound by true friendship and music. A man born on a transatlantic ship runs his entire life aboard, never set foot on land. He has an incredible heart and talent for music, he plays the piano without learning music. He meets another artist, a trumpeter who gets hired aboard the same ship. They become colleagues in the ship's orchestra that entertains the voyagers. A friendship that goes through years, while the piano player, who is not recorded in any official paper, never goes off the ship. A story about authentic male friendship."
"I can't believe the comments I've read regarding this film (""beautiful"", ""great"", ""masterpiece"" etc.). This is one of the most cliched, moronic pieces of junk I have ever seen. My wife and I rented it on DVD and we were groaning and laughing throughout the entire movie. One particularly laughable seen is where Tim Roth's character lights a cigarette off of the ""hot"" piano strings after his jazz duel with Jelly Roll Morton. I think Jelly Roll is probably rolling in his grave over that scene. I will grant that it is a nicely photographed film, but that's all I'll give it. Terrible script, terrible acting, forgettable music and heavy-handed direction. What was Tim Roth thinking of when he decided to star in this turkey? I now have a new rule when it comes to seeing movies. Never watch anything with ""Legend of"" in the title (e.g. Legend of Bagger Vance, Legends of the Fall, Legend of 1900)."
"There is a great moment in La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano (one of many, in fact): a musical duel in which meek pianist 1900 (Tim Roth), right after playing at vertiginous speed an impossible piece (much to the dismay of his smug adversary), gently touches an incandescent piano string with a cigarette, which is immediately ignited.Tornatore's bittersweet drama/character study crackles with creativity, emotion and wit. Roth is excellent as 1900, a childlike musical genius who refuses to leave the ship where he works as an entertainer; Pruitt Taylor Vince's portrayal of his best friend is vivid and engaging.The ending is surprisingly moving: Roth's last monologue could be his finest moment as an actor. Ennio Morricone provides the memorable score of a movie where music plays an essential role.7,5/10"
"Giuseppe Tornatore's work will always be compared with his excellent ""Cinema Paradiso"", a beloved film of audiences all over the world. He is a talented filmmaker who has worked extensively in the Italian cinema with success. ""The Legend of 1900"" shot in English presents a challenge for the talented director in that it is basically a film with an European sensitivity that does not work too well with a wide distribution. It is based on a monologue by Alessandro Baricco, the author of ""Silk"".Mr. Tornatore's stories are basically a look to the past as ""Malena"", ""The Star Maker"", ""Baaria"" and ""Cinema Paradiso"" prove. The director's love for his native land translates well as the setting for his films. Working in his native Sicily makes his films to immensely well felt, something that seems to be lacking in this venture. In this ambitious epic, the director adapted the material for a larger than life portrait of a man whose love for the sea proves to be his own doom. This ambitious canvas does not have the same feeling as his more intimate depictions of a society he knows well.In the written page, the text has an intimate feeling. In the finished product, the film did not translate as well. Part of the problem is the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Virginian, the home of '1900', a man that was born in the big ship. An auto didactic man, he finds a passion in playing the piano as the jazz era begins to make inroads in the life of America and the world. His talent is recognized, but his fear of living outside the only world he knew, prevented his becoming the sensation he should have been by not leaving the Virginian. Not even when he found love for the angelic immigrant he meets would make him abandon the only home he ever had.Tim Roth does a nice job of the pianist. Taylor Pruitt Vince is Max, 1900's best friend. Clarence Williams III makes an impressive Jelly Roll Morton. Peter Vaughn and Melanie Thierry are also featured. Ennio Morricone's music is a bit disappointing. He has done much better in his long career as a composer of musical scores. Lajos Koltai's cinematography is about the best thing in the film. His take on the luxury liner is impressive."
"This story is beautiful!, incredible, and pulled some tears out of me, touched my soul!, Excellent! Like Buena Vista Social Club says, ""Life without music is like a journey trough a dessert"". This is what this movie tells you all the time, with one of the most beautiful stories that i have ever seen!, the music takes you trough all the movie, touch your soul and send you trough a travel trough heaven!!, and specially, without being a Musical (genre that i personally don't like too much).The story, or legend of 1900, is a story of passion, feeling the soul of music, of friendship, of skills and of the hearth. Tim Roth here plays 1900, a piano player that has lived always on a cruise ship (The Virginia); he was found in the year 1900 by a charismatic worker of the ship, Danny (Bill Nunn); 1900 since his early years showed great natural skills on the piano; this movie is a musical story of his life, narrated by his best friend Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a trumpet player that spend with him various year in the orchestra of the ship. This movie shows beautiful scenes like the duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton with Max eating paper and the playing of music with the piano rolling trough the main room in the middle of a storm.Giuseppe Tornatore masterpiece!, with great cinematography, incredible production design, great costume design, and the best of all... Beautiful Music!. Excellent! 10/10"
"I happened to stumble upon this piece of cinematic genius quite by accident and was instantly drawed to it's world.Categorizing this movie is really difficult, I mean it tells a story about a child that is abandoned on a ship who grows to be the best musician ever, although he nevers leaves the ship, but it's not a musical even if the music plays a huge part of it, I wouldn't call it a drama or comedy eighter even as it incorporates huge amounts of both. I rather like to think that it's an experience more than a movie, it's an insight to the soul of the makers of this movie, it's a beautiful dream even. The way this story is told is immensely beautiful, the music, the visuals and actor performances build and support each other in the most perfect way, it should be seen even only to enjoy it's perfect execution. One the best experiences I have had in cinema."
"Director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) has lovingly crafted a bittersweet story about life, music and the intricate weave of one upon the other.  Tornatore caresses the heart with characters steeped in emotion and sentimentality without descending into sappiness (okay, maybe just a little at the end).  The setting is turn of the 20th century.  On New Year's Day, a baby is abandoned on an ocean liner and adopted by one of the crew members who names him `1900'.  The boy never leaves the vessel and crosses back and forth for his whole life.  As a child he learns to play piano and proves himself to be a genius at the instrument.The story is interesting by itself, but Tornatore brings incredible feeling to the tale.  1900 has an amazing gift of being able to put not only his emotions to music, but characterizations of others he sees around the room. All his pieces are impromptu and as original as the people surrounding him.Tim Roth is fantastic in the lead role, displaying extraordinary range.  He renders a believable pianist, but more importantly, he simultaneously brings the character dynamism and depth.  When he is playing the crowd he is the flamboyant showman, yet when he is alone or with Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) he is reflective and moody.Pruitt Taylor Vince also comes through with a strong performance as 1900's close friend and fellow musician.  Vince plays the part with great empathy and the interactions between him and Roth are often moving.  Clarence Williams III (yes, that's Linc from the Mod Squad TV series in the 60's) is electrifying as Jelly Roll Morton, the self proclaimed inventor of jazz. Williams steals the show for at least 15 minutes as he and Roth duel it out on the piano.The music is exquisite.  Ennio Morricone is a prolific composer whose career spans 40 years.  He has scored over 400 films including ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Disclosure"", and ""Twister"".  His ability to find the right music for the multiple moods in this film is astounding.
For viewers who enjoy complex character studies replete with unabashed sentimentality, this film is worth hunting down at the movie store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a richly rewarding experience."
"I finally got a DVD of this film, which never played in theatres here.  I was so stunned by its rich characters, atmosphere, emotion and subject, I watched it twice in one night.  This film is so intensely beautiful, it hurts.  It reminds me in some ways of ""The Red Violin,"" following a piano and pianist through the years.  Tim Roth's 1900 has a liquid face that tells us so much before he actually gets to verbalize his feelings about his life. The relationship between 1900 and Max is rich and satisfying.  The music is sublime.  Others have said there is too much dialogue, but I disagree.  The narration is economical and we wait so long for words from 1900, that when they come, you're grateful for every one. But mostly, the joy for the viewer is exploring the mind of 1900, a man of great depth, a skewed vision of the world and someone unlike anyone most of us ever know.  That's why I go to films--to meet unique characters who subtly alter the way we see the world.  Roth's performance is outstanding, as are those of every other actor in this film.  It's tragic that the film is marred by a really tacky model of the Virginian at sea and a deck set with items never found on the deck of any ship.  The interiors, however, are beautiful and the piano, costumes, extra casting and dock areas are all first rate."
"This film is piece of art considering the camera scenes you see, the music you hear. The dialogues give an insight into the life of a man with limited area of living and the philosophy he derives from this. Though this physically limited, the thoughts of the man reach every part of the world and add lots of phantasy to his music.The film is a romance, a drama and phycologic insight all at a time. The legend is carefully embedded in the frame story of one of the main actors - and there is no boring moment from the beginning till the very end.This film is NOT recommendable for people that prefer the style of ""sex, crime and happy-end"". There is none of this."
"I rented this based on the blurb on the DVD cover.  I found the film tedious and pretentious, and towards the end of it, I was predicting many of the spoken lines and all of the plot twists and turns.  The lead actor (Pruitt Taylor Vince) was wooden and unconvincing.  There were no likable characters in the film, and the premise was shallow and unconvincing.  I want my money back!!"
"I saw this in the theater in 2001 but for it's US theatrical distribution this film was cut from it's original 160 minute run time to 123 minutes. I see here that a lot of people enjoyed this film which I found to be good but not excellent as many viewed it to be. With a film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore of Cinema Paradiso fame and music from the great Ennio Morricone and the interesting storyline I felt this would be a good film to see but I ended up a little disappointed with the film. We never really learn how with no tutelage Novecento becomes the legendary pianist of the ocean. Presumably as some savant skill he was gifted with that listening to pianists play in the ship's ballroom as he grew up he picked it up without training or the ability to read music. The character is pretty dull despite growing up among hardened seafaring men of the boiler room and below deck and being exposed to high society above deck but I suppose one would possibly be kind of one dimensional if they lived on a single ship their entire lives never setting foot on land. Tim Roth is Novecento. Roth looks stiff in the title role. Despite being in a few hit movies like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Rosencrantz and Guilderstern Are Dead and Vincent and Theo earlier in his many films career he seems to have appeared in far more less memorable films including this one. Pruit Taylor Vince has the same career problem. Despite being in JFK, Mississippi Burning, Barfly and Natural Born Killers earlier in his career he also seems to get cast more forgettable ones than memorable ones. both Roth and Vince turn in stiff acting performances here. Clarence Williams III, best known as Linc from the old TV show Mod Squad plays Jelly Roll Morton. Morton was Creole from Louisiana who had mixed race blood but he didn't look black and looked more French so from a historical perspective as this film weaves an actual historical figure into it's fable, Williams is miscast. Williams by the way is pretty stiff himself in this film. The romantic angle in the film never really catches fire and the film has very little drama. This film looks good, has a mildly interesting story and a great soundtrack but despite it 40 years of trans Atlantic crossings it never really goes anywhere. I would give this a 6.0 of a possible 10 but wouldn't see it again."
"Watched this one with my love, and we both came away a bit disappointed. Nice enough imagery, music is fine, but the story doesn't really captivate or rather: it doesn't even simply 'get going'. A baby is 'somehow' left on a cruise-ship, the boy grows up and 'somehow' turns out to be a natural for the piano, 'somehow' rises to tremendous fame and in the end is not prepared to go out into the endless, asphyxiating world. He goes down with the ship, without having done anyting really worthwile. Neither intruiging depth nor amusing shallowness, no heart-stirring romance or nail-biting supsense: just a pretty long period of time containing not very much. Wouldn't pick this one if you wanted your date to curl up in your arms (though I did almost fall asleep)"
"Looking past all the things I dislike about this film I find there's an original plot, and one I could take to at that.However, the film is filled with a number of musical performances that hit all the wrong notes with me. Unless you are heavily into piano music, particularly early jazz, you may find the set musical pieces as tiresome as I did, to the extent that it spoils the entire film for you.A further problem of the music is that throughout you are to view the central character as some kind of uber-genius of the ivories. If you fail to enjoy the music to the extent that you nod and go ""yes, he is a piano God"" then much of the fuss and story surrounding him falls apart.I'm also not sure about Tim Roth. For some reason I like him a great deal in Reservoir Dogs even though a part of me feels his performance is flawed. In this his performance seems pretty woeful. He has a tick where he squeals a bit as he speaks when he's in a bit of emotional turmoil and I find that puts me off him. In this film he is also expected to do a bit of genius-fuelled wistfulness, but - I'm afraid - when he does this, I just find he looks a bit of a fool.It's got a nice feel of the period, but every time I tried to relax into the film and enjoy it, there was always something irking me."
"I saw this gem on IFC and I was happy to see others enjoyed this movie as much as I have. It's a quirky premise but so well-acted that you fall under its spell in a very short time. It's also beautifully photographed, btw. Roth is a first-rate actor and uses his skills to the fullest here.The one point I couldn't digest was the lack of loneliness displayed by 1900 (main character's name from his being born in 1900). Through most of the movie, he's obviously in his early 30s but never says a thing about his living in such isolation. Perhaps, as it's the only thing he's ever known, he just doesn't know what could be his in the outside world.., One of the highlights of the movie is the piano duel between the character acting as Jelly Roll Morton and 1900. It's really something to see and I'd love to know whose hands were doing the actual playing, as it was phenomenal.An excellent movie for a rainy day afternoon or, for that matter, anytime at all!"
"I knew nothing about this film other than it had Tim Roth in it and that is all that drew me by chance to tape it. What a surprise hidden gem of a film. A great understated performance by Tim Roth. The piano duel is a fantastic scene. I don't think I've seen anything like it before. The film SHOULD be famous for it. Why didn't this film get noticed when it came out at the cinema ? It reminds me of another forgotten brilliant film ""The Red Violin"". Watch both."
"Not too keen on this really. The story is pretty horrid and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good. After that it was pretty appalling. Tim doesn't fit the role, he comes across as a smug self inflated ass & Pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player. It's a idealist film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after watching it. There's no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates, he's completely self indulgent. I find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe i'm watching the wrong film. If you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle."
"The Legend of 1900Ocean liners are the ideal jazz venue because the audience has no means of escaping.Conversely, the pianist in this drama is attracting passengers to his vessel.When a ship worker finds a baby aboard the SS Virginian, he raises it as his own. But when he passes, the child - dubbed 1900 (Tim Roth) - must fend for himself. Eventually, he learns the piano and joins the vessel's orchestra - never once stepping foot on dry ground. When word of his talents reaches the mainland, famed pianist Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) boards the Virginian to challenge him to a piano duel.While the narrative never goes beyond the concept, and 1900's character arc is basically nonexistent, this adaptation of an Italian novel makes up for its shortfalls with dynamic direction and scorching soundtrack.However, if the ship ever starts sinking it's probably smart to say you play the triangle. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
"This is my favourite film of all time. 'Nuff said.... but it's a review so here's more...Why is it my favourite film? Because it touches all of life, in the most poignant ways possible. It's a story about astral travel, about the power of one's environment over one's mind, of the power of friendship, about deep commitment, about the very best of jazz music improvisation, about the triumph of spirit over all, about the alluring voice of the sea and the challenge of facing change, about the grace of accepting one's true nature despite societal pressure. All without ever leaving a single location.This is an incomparable movie. If I could give it 11 stars I would."
"The Legend of 1900 is a special film; it is on my top 100 films of all time, and that is not easy to be listed on. It is the second best film project ever completed by the team of director Tornatore and film score creator, Morricone. It is second only to Cinema Paradiso, the greatest Italian classic film of all time. The lead actors and production values are topnotch and the script is absolutely impeccable.
The story of a baby born and abandoned on top of a piano of a luxury liner on New Year's Day of 1900 is fascinating. He is raised on the ship by a 5th Deck (men who shoveled coal for the liner's energy) seaman for eight years, and then after the seaman's unfortunate demise, lives on his own, in the bowels of the ship. And there is more thing about him
He is the greatest piano player who ever lived.
He is a master of the piano by age eight; and entertains the entire crew and passenger categories, from the poorest to the richest. He becomes part of the luxury liner band and has several adventures during the numerous crossings of the ship. He even meets a beautiful girl, but does not pursue their relationship off the ship after she departs. The sea is his mistress; and he never abandons her.
The primary motifs of this film are the piano and the ocean, as well as a good friend who blows a pretty mean horn. However, the opening motif, which is repeated a few times in various crossings, is also important. There is always one person, who in the early morning mist, while approaching New York Harbor, sees the Statue of Liberty for the first time, like an angel parting the clouds of upcoming democracy. ""AMERICA!"" the excited immigrant yells, and a roar goes up from the large crowd of immigrants on the deck as everyone faces the statue and the ship enters the impressive harbor of New York City.
These scenes are accompanied by outstanding music, as are several other scenes in this classic film. As the protagonist explains, all things have a beginning and end, and being confined to a small piece of land for him would have been a premature end to his existence. So he opts to live and die on the sea. Both the sea and the piano are eternal and unlimited in scope. This film is a must-see for any serious film buff."
A big film by a unique story as you have seen befor
"So here it is, a landmark event, the occurrence of me finding my 100th ""10"" movie, as rated by the IMDB. There are movies on my list that would NEVER probably find their way onto those of the great critics. After all, for me, it's not about technical wizardry or having all the pieces fall into the right places. I've given 10s to movies that have flaws. Even ones that have problems.But for me, everything boils down to feel. Everything comes down to how much the movie messed with me, how I went in looking at the world one way, and came out the other side with my brains mixed up. How now there are new colors in the world, thanks to this new perspective that's changed everything forever. THE LEGEND OF 1900, starting Tim Roth, and written and directed by one of my favorite directors, Giuseppe Tornatore, the man who made CINEMA PARADISO, is my 100th ""10"". I've just watched it, and love is the only word that serves it justice, for me. From the amazing music played (even IF Tim Roth had to fake it) to the absolutely top-notch delivery done by ALL of the cast, right down to the extras in the background and the girl that barely had any lines... I've been touched. I've been moved. I've cried.I'm in love.It's the story of a man trying to tell the story of his friend, who was born and left on an ocean liner, and grows up on it. As a bonus, he's a master musician, a prodigy, who picks it up as he goes along.The story is about his life, and the music he plays. The people he influences, the effects his music has on the world that he touches. It's about the way we look at life, at fame, at living. I don't want to give anything away. Suffice to say that it was funny, moving, dramatic, touching, heartwarming, absolutely beautiful, and well worth the price of admission. I absolutely loved it.I choose to give nothing away. It was wonderful. Go and watch it, and see for yourself."
"As the title says this movie is more of a Legend/Tale than a movie . I went into this movie with a lot of hype after ""Cinema Paradiso"" , I am shocked how different it feels . 
Ennio Morricone is the hero of the movie , What a soundtrack . Guisseppe Tornatore does his best to capture the audience's attention by making us wait for certain event in the movie everytime a Act comes to climax .

"Add this obscure film to your list of Must-See movies. It's one of those elusive 'great' movies most people have never heard of, much less seen.Powerful, emotional, evocative, foot-tapping.Did you like ""Titanic""? You'll love ""The Legend of 1900"".Do you like music, especially jazz? You'll love ""The Legend of 1900"".I laughed and I cried. A great film. (What more can I say?)Although it is a totally different film, ""The Legend of 1900"" has many of the elements found in the brilliant Swedish movie, ""As It Is In Heaven"" (2004) -- music, friendship, and love. Sometimes, inspiration is where you least expect it... Give it a try, you'll find inspiration in ""The Legend of 1900"","
"No major SPOILERS here.Starts off as one of those European, ""grand"" (read: pretentious-looking), overly sentimental turn-of-the-century epics, but it gradually, steadily but firmly, starts growing on you. It's a highly idealized bio of a larger-than-life fictional character. I moaned when Roth, as a child, immediately learned to play the piano with great skill the day he first saw it. But, as I said, Roth plays a larger-than-life guy so anything goes; there are practically elements of fantasy here, even though this isn't literally spelled out. One has to accept the otherwise absurd premise that a man who is born on a ship, willingly spends half a century aboard it without once setting foot on land. Yet the movie is shot so well, and combined with the pleasant music (not ""pleasant"" as in ""puts you to sleep"") it pulls you in, especially in the second half. Roth appears too aloof for a while and his character too mysterious and undefined, but his long, very interesting speech to the trumpet player at the end of the movie clarifies a lot in a strange and original way. It's always good to be pleasantly surprised by a movie that starts off not-very promisingly, and then improves so much that it's never boring and even fascinating all the way to the end. It doesn't even matter that 1900 grew up with an American foster parent, but - as Roth - developed a British accent. The movie is good, so I'll leave the nit-picking for some other time..."
"I used to love this film. I am a big fan of Tornatore almost as much as I am of Fellini. And Tim Roth happens to be one of my favorite actors and on the whole this is a great movie. Today I don't know when I look back at the ending of this film I say could he not have been put on another ship? And the fact that he never gets off the boat, I mean OK he need not do it for good, but just to take a walk around, you know, he can stick to his convictions and then go back. Lets say he could have gone to just simply visit that girl he fell in love with and to hear the sea from the land which is a completely different thing as he was told."
"This movie is absolutely everything a music-lover could hope for. OK, so I'll agree with the all the criticism that this movie has gotten. The acting isn't fantastic, the story may be a bit far-fetched... but one has to realize that the movie isn't entirely ABOUT any of those things. It is about the one thing it sets to describe... music.Music is clearly the centerpiece of this film. Not actually music itself (although there is quite a bit of good music in it) but rather the philosophy behind music. Music as an expressive art. Music as a descriptive tool. Music as a way to relate to life. Tim Roth's character, Nineteen Hundred's perspective on life is exactly his philosophies concerning music: he can make infinite things happen in a limited amount of space. Like in his last monologue... he can make infinite music on a finite keyboard... he cannot make any music on an infinite keyboard.If you want to see an A-class movie with A-class acting, you may be disappointed. But if you're looking for a beautifully artistic movie about the philosophy of music, this one deserves more than a 10 out of 10. I'd highly recommend it to any musician who loves music as more than audio noise; to anyone who sees life in music and music in life."
"An outstanding feature of this film is the atmosphere developed in all the crowd scenes.  The early morning arrival of the SS Virginian filled to the brim with well-heeled passengers and excited emigrants shouting ""America!"" is a most moving spectacle. Another crowd scene is deep down in the belly of the ship where stokers grimy and sweaty are shovelling coal into the open mouths of the fiery boilers.  The whole scene is grim and threatening with steel platforms and steel steps, heavy chains and pulleys, men shouting above the noisy activity. Then again many decks above bring us to the crowded dance floor aglow with the rich and famous out for a good time with wine,women and song. Diector Giuseppe Tornatore handles all these scenes superbly and with true feeling. In all this shipboard activity is a lonely man called 1900. Of unknown parentage he was given that name by stokers down below after being found in a box on the grand piano in 1900. He was born at sea, lived his whole life at sea and could never bring himself to leave the ship. He died at sea. The character 1900 is played by three people - a baby (adorable), a young boy (charming) and a grown man (Tim Roth).  Most people will remember this film for the exciting piano playing competition.  I have never seen such nimble fingers as they rattle over the keys and hammer the piano wires into a fiery temperature.  The photography at this point with its multiple overlapping images of hands and piano keys helps to build the excitement. It's pretty serious business because bets are laid on the outcome of the competition. 1900 has one true friend, a trumpet player.  I like the scene where the two men seated at the piano (with the brakes off) race at a terrifying speed around the ballroom as the ship lurches to and fro in the heavy seas. I have a couple of queries though.  I may have missed something in the film but I cannot recall how 1900 learnt to play so well and who taught him.  But it makes a great scene and the music is exciting and enjoyable.   And that girl....peering in through the porthole as young 1900 woos her with his gentle notes.  What a gorgeous angelic creature who touches the heart of 1900 for a fleeting moment!  Such a small role and yet the glow of her face remains long after the credits fade."
"I loved the idea for this movie when I first heard about it a couple of years ago.  I was looking forward to the movie, which I finally saw last night.  It was a major disappointment, and I cannot even imagine how agonizing it was before the edits.  The dialogue was some of the worse I've heard in awhile - maybe it doesn't translate well.  In any event, I'd never recommend it."
"It's possible that 'cinema' (or ""the movies"") could be one of Tornatore's thematic preoccupations. Given that the director of CINEMA PARADISO made THE LEGEND OF 1900 at the time when cinema was celebrating its first 100 years, it is possible to read the film as a reflection on the state of cinema as it enters its second centenary.One can't say for certain. For the most part the film concentrates on telling its story. However, the scent of metaphor hangs in the air. Just below the surface lies a resigned nostalgia hinting that the ""greatness"" of cinema may be a thing of the past. Like a big old rusting passenger ship consumed by an indifferent ocean, the brilliance and splendour of cinema has sunk to the bottom of a sea of mediocrity. THE LEGEND OF 1900 suggests that cinema has been reduced to churning out repetitious and facile dead-in-the-water crowd-pleasers, one lumbering TITANIC after another, and it does so by being exactly that.There is a pivotal scene near the end of the film where Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) talks to the character known as '1900' (Tim Roth) within the rusted bowels of the abandoned ship (the worn-out wreckage of cinema). 1900 has never been on dry land. The ship is the only reality he has ever known, and he refuses to leave. As it creaks and groans beneath them, Max tries to convince him by describing the world beyond the vessel as a place of infinite choice, but he knows that 1900 will never accept the mediocrity of dry land (modern-day commercial movies). There is no place in such a world for the true artist. 1900 will go down with the ship (the discarded notion of cinematic art) rather than compromise his true nature. So, did Tornatore intend THE LEGEND OF 1900 as a denunciation of big-budget commercial Euro-puddings, cleverly making the film in the vacuous style of its worst excesses (i.e. criticising the likes of TITANIC by emulating them), or did he simply make a vacuous film? I suspect the latter. As one of the characters says, 'You're never really done-for as long as you have a good story, and someone to tell it to'. Maybe he meant to say, 'someone to SELL it to'."
"Seems a lot of folk that watch movies, have the mistaken view that if a film looks in anyway whatsoever 'different' it 'must' be good!. I'd imagine that '1900' must have made some members of the Italian fine Arts Council, and all those listed in the credits for pouring tons of money into this fiasco, want to hide themselves in the rest-room after the premiere. They must to this day, still be hiding the investment figures from any government auditors ~ following a massive $9 Million dollars, that returned less than $260,000. The version my wife and I watched was the international, running a seemingly interminable 123 Min's. To think that some poor souls overseas had to sit through 170 Min's is untenable. As it was, my wife kept asking how much longer can they stretch this ridiculously thin material? Perhaps the original Monologue by Alessandro Baricco (if it was short enough) may have held up, but as an overblown movie, not quite so.Director: Giuseppe Tornatore (and his bank-rollers) must have thought that after the success of 'Cinema Paradiso' everything he touches will turn to gold. But as this movies huge losses showed...all that glitters is not gold. And 'glitter' this movie does, big time. The sets are HUGE, but overdone to the point of being unintentionally unconvincing. Director of Photography: Hungarian born Lajos Koltai works hard, but the story and situations are simply so outlandishly foolish, that he can only attempt to add some visual saving graces. I would even go so far to say the word 'Fable' was added to the publicity as a last minute bid to salvage a complete wreak, following audience reactions.As a collector of Ennio Morricone soundtracks, I even found this score uninspired, as if he too knew this one was was doomed to failure.If you're easily pleased, and love 'Arty' pretensions, then you might enjoy this not entirely successful overindulgence. As with another film of director Tornatore; the very stylish, sex fueled, foul mouthed entry 'Malena'...I hope to never suffer either again. Maybe '1900' is OK for those that like to add their own depth to shallow fiction. It's also possible it might have been better if it had been given a way less excessive treatment ~ or even a better choice of stars (these look as if they're wondering if they've wandered onto the wrong set) it might then have come a little closer to working, but wouldn't hold out too much hope...."
"1900 is a very good movie, but it was too flawed to be a true classic. It might sound like I didn't enjoyed, but I really did. Tim Roth doesn't have anything to prove, he's a terrific actor and he gave an excellent performance.However, Pruitt Taylor Vince, his main counterpart, just kinda was there. I think a different actor could've provided quite a boost. Vince lacked presence and was at best ""good."" The polish that you take for granted in classics was very much lacking here.Tim Roth and a great story are forced to stand alone - with supporting characters and direction failing to make an impact."
"A long long film. In the end, the huge ship bursts into pieces , I felt a light , slight, mild or inconspicuous anguish in my heart, but sudden and short.The first scene of adult 1900, he walked into the ballroom, followed by the trumpet player. Sitting at the piano, he played beautiful music while the piano dancing on the ground. Startling graceful, this maybe the most accurate adjective to describe the scene, music, piano, dancing, pianist, everyone in that ballroom, even the awkward trumpet player. I think most audience would have the same feeling with me at this scene: 1900 is a different protagonist . With great talent for music , he brought so many amazement to people on that passenger liner as well as the audience, especially he competes with that so-called greatest pianist from shore, completely stunning! However, I feel the theme of this film is of sadness though I totally lost in the main idea people who create it would like to express. 1990 is afraid of the ashore life, maybe just like I am afraid of Hitchcock, Agatha . But it should be different, my fear comes from the thrilling scene ( maybe not thrilling at all in others' opinion) , the suspenseful plot or deep shadowiness of human beingÂÂIf I have not read a novel or watched a film like that, I would never know my scare at this, even it haunts me like nightmare when I am alone , I am still curious and willing to accept the ""horrible"" novel or film when it comes to me occasionally.Unknown fear of ashore life confined 1990 to the ship , in which he was raised up and played tremendously ""magic music"" . To him, land is even more terrible than death. Sometimes people like a fragile rose on a thin golden stem, delicate, exquisite but weak and helpless. Feeling makes human powerful , at the same time, it can destroy human 's outlook, hope and life. More talented, more sensitive; more sensitive, more fragile; more fragile, more touching , it's a perfect description of literature, fine arts, music ,drama and life!"
The film is amazing. The musics are amazing. The actors are amazing. Nothing is bad about the film. It makes you cry like nothing else. It's really a special film in my heart. Definitely a must watch.
Why was the release date 1998...? I worked on a cruise ship from 1996-1997. I am 100% sure this film was shown at least 5 times a week on the onboard TV channel. I watched it so many times i can't tell you.. by late 1997 I had already moved to Asia and I haven't seen it since.. is there some mistake? Am I crazy? Was I in a coma at that time and just made it up?? Am I even real??
"When 1900 heard the voice of ocean everyone mentioned, his loneliness isn't came from without friends or lover, that's the deep loneliness belonged of human beings."
This is the film which i can see everyday think about it all time it perfect actors are perfect bravo
"Picked the DVD in the local library, thinking it was a movie about a hero of a war or something. Turned out it was a drama, and a very entertaining one too. I don't usually enjoy slow paced drama, but I was glued to my tv screen watching this till end, and feel a bit emotional at the end too."
"An amusing, touching, heartfelt, soulful & sentimental delight that brims with warmth, is crafted with passion, and sails on the breezy tides of Ennio Morricone's awe-inspiring score, Giuseppe Tornatore's The Legend of 1900 is a wonderful fable of music, passion, life & friendship that may not be able to justify its daunting runtime but there is a comforting & magical quality to it that nonetheless compels us to journey wherever it wants to take us."
"This is a whimsical yet poignant portrait of a man who has spent his entire life aboard a steamship traversing the Atlantic, earning his stay as one of the ship's musicians after he was raised by a crewman on board and left with no place else to go after his benefactor died in an unfortunate accident. It's at times fanciful and capricious, and at other times emotionally wrenching. Much of the story is told through the recollection of Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a trumpet player with the steamer Virginian, who formed a friendship and bond with the pianist who came to be known as 1900, having been born on the first day of that year. In hindsight and a series of flashbacks, Max recalls his association with 1900 (Tim Roth) and their adventures at sea, and how the enigmatic pianist maintained his resolve to remain captive to the Virginian's spell over the many years. A couple of noteworthy scenes entertained this viewer, the first being the playful sequence in which 1900 plays the piano in a grand ballroom during a storm, during which the careening piano eventually crashes through a huge wall of glass and into a passenger's stateroom. The other was the apparently intense competition between 1900 and jazz great Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) for musical supremacy among the ship's passengers. Wonderfully filmed , I was particularly taken with a scene in which 1900 wistfully stares out of one of the ship's windows after he tries to disembark but is unable to, due to his attachment to the Virginian. Using a truly original and clever technique, the rain outside the ship creates a slight stream of water to run along 1900's face simulating a tear from his right eye. The effect was very evocative of the way 1900 was feeling at the time, and a credit to the cinematographer for coming up with such a unique device. In it's own way, the scene foretold that there would be no happy ending to this tale of lost love and friendship, being more a character study defining the way someone has chosen to live their life with no attachments and no place to call home."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano"" (1998) is a long epic, kinda forgotten one. I actually did not head anything about this movie but just now, when spotted it for a first time at the bottom of IMDb top 250 movies list. Its a bit crazy that this movie came out basically in the same year as ""Titanic"" have, which costed nearly 200 million dollar and this movie just 6.Overall, ""La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano"" is a good fantasy story about a man who lived his life entirely on a ship. It sound a bit unrealistic, and this movie is unrealistic but its not tried to be anything else. I found the performances just OK but nothing special. The look of the movie was really good and cinematography was great - surely the music itself which plays a huge role was excellent. While at the running time 2 h 45 min this movie did drag here and there (its a very long movie), i did enjoyed it because of the simplistic story which probably will never be told again on a big screen in the age of superhero movies. This is a good movie all in all, which has a heart in a right place."
"Although no one would argue that the plot here isn't completely original, the actual film is still incredibly flawed, even to the extent that by the time film reaches the halfway mark the story had become dull and the pacing laborious. Clearly, Tim Roth is a fine actor who has impressed in the likes Made in Britain (1980), Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and it is to his credit somewhat that the film survives as long as it does, but I have to honestly admit that the best parts of the film are the earlier sequences that revolve around the child version of Novecento (the character that Roth plays), who's wide-eyed sense of wonder and mystique leads him up into the ship and to the grand piano so central to the plot.Alongside the interesting plot and unconventional character there are some fine performances from the supporting cast, as well as some particularly strong emotional themes, such as the ideas of loneliness and the class divide, but for me, the film really struggled to keep itself going with the short scope of the running time or the rushed, unfinished feeling found in many of the individual scenes. Admittedly, I have not seen any other Tornatore films, despite the amount of critical praise that his Cinema Pardiso (1988) has been given, but it seems that with this film he's either compromised his vision in order to appeal to a more mainstream American audience or simply, I've seen some horribly truncated, studio re-cut (which could be the case, as it would seem that Tornatore has been badly treated by US/UK distributors in the past, who insist on cutting his films down to more easily digestible running times). If this is the case, then I sincerely apologise, but even so; I'm not sure I can imagine a film of this scope working at anything less than a suitably epic four-hour running time, akin to something like Bernardo Bertolucci's similarly set historical piece, 1900 (1976).As you could expect, the cinematography throughout is impeccably beautiful, employing haunting shots of the ocean liner drifting out of the fog like a ghost to create an entirely alien world reminiscent of Fellini's great work And the Ships Sails On (1982). The production design is also remarkable, and the attention to detail that Tornatore and his crew have put into the film is second to none, but for me, the film just failed to maintain that sense of momentum over such a short duration. The Legend of 1900 (1998) is still an interesting, remarkable beautiful looking film, but one that I feel fails to deliver on its epic potential. It is elevated somewhat by the aforementioned photography, the haunting score from Enio Moerricone and the commendable performances from Roth, Bill Nunn and the underrated Pruitt Taylor Vince."
"Enjoyable film, very sad but thought-provoking. Tim Roth's character, 1900 was tragic as he just could not develop his life. It was like the ship was his surrogate mother who he was unable to leave. I loved the fact that his 'father' was a black man too. I would have loved to see 1900 have romance and experience life on land, albeit for a short moment. If only he could make that journey to shore, who knows his life could have different. Beautiful, sad film."
"Unusual and definitely not for everyone, THE LEGEND OF 1900 is a magical tale that should have great appeal for those possessed of a certain kind of sensitivity. What kind? I wish I could tell you. I imagine this is a film that will say different things to different people. Is it sad? Could be. Is it triumphant? Yeah, that case could be made. Is it enigmatic? Now you're getting it.What will a story about a man who, from infancy, has spent his entire life on board a luxury liner (and become a musical prodigy along the way), never having set foot on dry land, say to you?He has a name (a mouthful), but they call him ""1900."" Every conceivable segment of society - the world in microcosm - has walked the decks of the Virginia, and he's seen it all, touched it all, but it's a world he's never been a part of. And with the Virginia now scheduled to pass from existence, what choice will he make? Can he choose? Has he already chosen?Much analysis of various themes has been done in other commentaries about this film, but ultimately, each viewer will decide - or, perhaps, feel - what it's telling them. In any case, I'll wager that for many, this will be one of those beloved movies they'll want to revisit regularly through the years, and from the thought of which, between viewings, they'll feel that little tug in whatever special place it's touched them."
"*** Some Slight Spoilers***The Legend of 1900 is a neglected pearl of a movie.  Behind the sentimental exterior is concealed a profound statement, which is the trademark of Giuseppe Tornatore's style.  Much like in Cinema Paradiso, the director's attention concentrates on the torments, tortures and dilemmas of change.  In our culture the notions of ""growing up"" and ""maturing"" are treated not only as inevitable but also self-evidently positive.  The story of 1900 is only marginally about the fear of entering and dealing with the uncertainties of the big scary world ""out there"" (Danny the sailor warns the little 1900 that the ""sharks on land"" are far more cruel and voracious than the ones swimming in the ocean).  In my opinion, Tornatore dwells here with one of the deepest and painful problems of human life: how do you establish your own significance in the world filled with cold indifference? how do you know who and what you are?  Everybody in the film tries to convince 1900 (masterfully and ironically played by Tim Roth) to take that fateful step and get off the ship in order to ""BECOME SOMETHING.""  They all assume and believe that to be something, to gain significance, one must leave his ""ship"" and prove himself in the eyes of the ""real world"" -- the collection of powerful groups whose opinions and decisions are somehow more important that those of the small milieu of the one's parochial world.  One's recognition, one's validation comes from some powerful forces ""out there,"" on land.  Frequent digressions about the fact that as far the ""world was concerned,""  1900 did not even exist.  In his final monologue, 1900 himself admits with a touch of regret that the world had bypassed him.  But, damn it, why do we all constantly have to care about what the ""world"" thinks of us, makes of us??  Why, in order to live ""fulfilled"" lives, do we seek ""recognition""?  Who are the judges?  1900 perhaps unconsciously fights against having to define himself in terms of what the ""world"" or ""real life"" make of him.  He chooses anonymous death aboard the Virginia cruise ship.  His death is as unknown as was his birth.  The world did not know about his existence, his art, his personal agony.  But 1900 never defined his worth, or the meaning of his life in terms of ""public opinion"" and vain glory.  He left not a trace of his existence to this seemingly all-important world.  All he left to us was his legend.  And that's all that really mattered.Overall, a wonderful film.  Fantastic music.  Excellent song at the end! Highly recommended for thinking and open-minded viewership."
"Well written, well acted, and well received! Three thumbs up for this movie, the first I've purchased since Les Miserables! English is so limited in superlatives, but this movie deserves them all. Some have commented, 'this was a disappointment' for them; they erred in expecting it to be more than it was-- a legend. Legends die, that's what makes them memorable . Although not a hidden agenda of the author, I took a valuable lesson away from this movie. And it becomes clearer with each time I re-watch it (#7 so far) Don't lock yourself in your own little world--get off the ship of your little town or die in it! The truly great men from Jesus to Bill Gates got out of their hometown, and small town thinking, this resulted in greatness for both of them and thousands of others who did the same. Not to be measured financially-- but how they affected others in a positive way. You and I can be that... a great force for good , by taking our skills and using them for the common good. Don't sink with your ship, die knowing you've changed somethingfor the better."
"This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  It is an epic with incredibly rich cinematography, moving music and dialogue that commands attention.  It is understated and elegant.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone with a soul."
"Some of my favorite film experiences were those I was unprepared for and just happened upon. One such film was when I was about 9 years old and late at night on Christmas eve, alone with the tv, I came across a film that totally captivated me in every way imaginable. That film was ""Its a Wonderful Life"". A similar feeling came over me, when, on a flight from Rome to New York on Alitalia, ""Legend of 1900"" came on as the second in flight film. It was one of the most visually and musically stunning films I have ever seen. This film experience was just wonderful, and I don't hesitate to put it in my top 3 of all time. I just purchased the DVD and look forward to enjoying this personal classic over and over again. A wonderful story with great acting."
"Tornatore is in my opinion, the best cineaste of our time. Cinema Paradiso is a classic by itself. In this movie, of course, I loved the Morricone haunting music, the idea of the story, the cinematography. Performances by Tim Roth and Vince are superb. It is a must see movie.  DonÂ´t miss it. YouÂ´ll love it."
"It is a rare thing to have a movie truly touch you.  It is rarer still to be able to watch a movie repeatedly and get the same effect without fail, every single time you watch it.  This, however, is exactly what the film ""The Legend of 1900"" accomplishes.  From its opening depiction of immigrants to America, to the climactic piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton (which has some of the best damned jazz piano I have ever heard in a film), this movie show exactly what should be presented in a drama.  It is not designed to simply be depressing and sappy, but it has a meaning.  That life is just too vast and beautiful for some people to comprehend, and that for those people, living they're life between a bow and stern (hope thats the back and front ;) ) is the only real existence they need, and that every man should do what he needs to in order to have a happy life.  The performances by the principle characters are amazing, truly inspiring, and as an actor I can truly appreciate the depth that Tim Roth gives to his character, especially in his explanation to Max at the end about why it is he could never leave the ship.  I highly recommend this film to every movie buff out there, if not for the wonderful acting, the earth shattering piano duel."
