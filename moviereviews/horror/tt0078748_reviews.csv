"What makes Alien great is it's synchronization of sound, visuals and showing great attention to detail. Not only that but Alien has an unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. We're introduced to a crew who is not exactly too friendly to each other add to that the ship. It's huge, and with its halls and corridors it feels almost like a maze.
Enter Alien, a ruthless parasite with humanoid form yet it lacks any civilised traits of a human. It does have humanoid form but it doesn't give a single emotion. The design of the monster is what's the most terrifying (and it still holds up despite Alien being released in 1979). The creature is also better adopted to the ships interior making a big part of movie feel like a sinister game of cat and mouse.
What I particularly like is how the characters are written. They are not Hollywoodized heroes, in fact there is no hero. They're just people which makes them even more threatened. The performances are all equally realistic and do deliver. Kudos to director Ridley Scott for using crafty cinematography and combining it with shadows and lights in an eerie way. The music is unrelenting and combined with Scott's cinematography, sound and visuals it adds to the eeriness.
The plot is also not another Hollywoodized cliché. It's more like ""survival of the fittest"". The characters battle true terror as they race to survive or outlive each other, they're all just a part of a race to see who will prevail and who will die.
Final Grade: 10/10"
"A masterpiece one of the best classic sci-fi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the sci-fi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about ""extraterrestrial life form"" it is interesting, brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect, the script, the actors, puppetry, models, and special effects about Alien design. I would give this movie an 8 but it deserves a perfect 10 because it has a vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. Dan O'Bannon wrote brilliantly a story and screenplay with help from Ronald Shusett. Both of them make a brilliant imaginative story. This film has no plot holes I don't see them. Helen Horton as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo's computer was believable and realistic and well performed. The design for the parasite (the facehugger) was excellent designed and brilliant. Everyone from the cast in here at acting is spectacular and acts believable. I love all the characters: Parker, Brett, Lambert, Ripley, Ash, Captain Dallas, Kane and even Jonesy the cat. He was really trained I love that cat in this movie. The design about the ship Nostromo is fantastic and so is space and the computers in this film. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger which the effects and designs were excellent spectacular created in the film. Jerry Goldsmith makes an excellent music score for the film that I have enjoy it. My favorite scene in this film is when Parker torchers with flamethrower on Ash's corpse and burns his remains great a special effect. This movie stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Bolaji Badejo and Helen Horton they are all believable in their roles.This is my favorite science fiction film tough I prefer Aliens over this film (because it is my favorite film), The Thing, Leviathan even The Blob as a horror films because I enjoy them more but ""Alien"" is my favorite science fiction film the best of it's kind. 10/10 doesn't deserve the hate."
"'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space). I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

"In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains. All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10"
"Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.RATING: 10"
"Director Ridley Scott's well-honed talents of pacing and editing create a tense atmosphere that superbly conveys dread and fear of an unknown, unseen evil entity.  In 1979, the technology didn't exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do.  Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about.  Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit.  Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger's hallucinations to make a successful picture.The dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled."
"The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level."
"""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film."
"This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. ""Alien"" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10Rated R: violence/gore and profanity"
"Three words perfectly describe ALIEN: Long, dark and ominous.You know you're in for a good time when even the opening title gives you a shiver. The music plays perfectly as the word 'ALIEN' slowly appears, line by line. Then there are the establishing shots of the ship; poorly maintained, claustrophobic.And then there's basically forty minutes of people in a ship pondering and eating and getting along (or not). The film has one little thing that allows it to draw you along so slowly - a promise. A promise made by the advertisements and hype that this was going to kick your ass. You just had to wait.But when it happens, it happens. Though the film doesn't speed up per se, there's a lot more happening in front of the screen to make it at least look like stuff's going on. The first half crawls almost depressingly, but the second half catches your eye and refuses to let go.I suggest everyone sees this film. Even if you skip through the beginning, you need to see this. It defined sci-fi and horror all in one.It's perfect."
"The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !"
"Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic, documentary-like sci-fi films ever made. Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 10/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company)"
"ALIEN received mixed reviews when it debuted in 1979--largely from science fiction critics, who accused it of being little more than a sort of Friday the 13th in Outer Space, a blood-and-gore horror flick given a futuristic twist via special effects. But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one. Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android ""revival"" are fairly notorious). There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.BUT. The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money. Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictability of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups. With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct. Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars. A word of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one. And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself! Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!"
"Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about...."
"As the credits of ""Alien"" open, the slowly paced opening titles and soft, eerie score give some indication of what viewers will experience when watching this film.  It starts off so unassumingly that first-time viewers are unlikely to be moved by the story or inspired by the slight character development in the film's first half.  It is in fact this lack of certainty that makes ""Alien"" work so well, for as the film hits it second half it shifts dramatically from slow space road movie to an intergalactic haunted house fright show.  This flip in drama, pace and tension makes for an unnerving ride into the unknown and results in one of the landmark sub-genre-sci-fi movies of the 20th century. The film is directed by Englishman Ridley Scott, who had a total of one feature and numerous commercials under his belt when he took control of proceedings.  Since the success of ""Alien"", Scott has had an uneven career with highlights like ""Blade Runner"", ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Gladiator"" and most recently ""Black Hawk Down"" and low points like ""Legend"", ""G.I. Jane"" and the bore-fest ""1492"".  ""Alien"" represents the overtly stylistic and slick approach Scott brings to his films, traits that are useful in science fiction but can sometimes seem out of place in more realistic genres. Here Scott retires the glitz and glamour of ""Star Wars"", which had been released two years before ""Alien"".  Instead he portrays the spacecraft and crew as nothing more than a cargo ship and a rag tag bunch of intergalactic truckers.  This works very well, as the viewer gets the distinct sense of the tedium and oppressive vastness of space travel.  The way the crew are so nonchalant about visiting another planet makes the audience feel that yes, perhaps one day man will view space travel with a shrug. The opening scene shows us a huge spaceship, named the Nostromo, returning to earth with 20,000,000 tonnes of mineral ore on board.  The crew sleep in hibernation, until the onboard computer awakens them.  It seems the computer has picked up a possible distress signal on an alien planet.  Under the law of the nameless and faceless 'Company', the crew are obliged to investigate. The waking scene is superbly filmed.  Kane (John Hurt) slowly rises, like a chick from and egg.  Squinting and only partially awake, slow dissolves from one angle of Kane to another emphasise his delirium and partial consciousness.  The final dissolve dissipates to the mess hall.  Here we meet the entire crew of the Nostromo for the first time. The ship is led by Dallas (Tom Skerrit), with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as the first officer.  Ash (Ian Holm) is the odd, skittish science officer, Kane (John Hurt) is weathered but adventurous, Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the whiny and weak navigation officer, and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) are the engineering grunts.  The ship is controlled by Mother, a mute version of HAL 9000 from 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Like ""2001"", the reasons for having humans on board is unknown; they almost seem pointless as the ship can basically control itself.  Are they simply pawns or guinea pigs awoken at the will of the computer? They respond to the distress signal after landing on the desolate planet. The beacon is tracked to a derelict spaceship, which Kane, Lambert and Dallas enter.  Curious and naïve, Kane wonders into a cavern of eggs. Stumbling on the slippery surface, he slips and comes into contact with the living contents of the egg.  With the parasite attached to his face, Dallas and Lambert rush Kane back to the ship. On board Ripley, who is now in command, demands that Kane be kept in quarantine for 24 hours.  Against her wishes, the odd Ash lets the three crew in.  Upon removing Kane's helmet they find a claw shaped being attached to his face.  It eventually falls off and dies and amazingly, Kane awakens, seemingly unscathed. At this stage the film remains slow and ponderous.  Intent on getting back to earth, they have one final meal before returning to hibernation.  As they eat Kane convulses violently and a creature bursts through his chest.  In utter disbelief the crew watch it skuttle away to the far reaches of the ship.From this point the film takes off.  Space and distance are enclosed as Scott uses a brilliant mix of close ups and wide angled shots to display the vastness of the Nostromo and the claustrophobia in the crew. The alien and set design are outstanding.  The massive sexual overtones of Swiss artist's H.R. Giger's alien and derelict ship are truly breathtaking, as is the futuristic-retro styling of Michael Seymour's sets.  Grubby yet cool, the production quality of ""Alien"" is something to admire. It took seven more years before a sequel was made and when James Cameron took over the directing chair he revolutionised the series by making it all out action over spooky sci-fi with ""Aliens"".  It may be a better movie, but the original remains a quality stand alone film and a landmark in the sci-fi horror sub genre that has not been matched by any other saga."
"Seven members of a space mining cargo ship who are headed back to Earth are awakened from hypersleep when their ship detects a signal from an intelligent civilization on a small, uncharted planet. When they locate the source of the signal, they find more than they bargained for, and all of their lives are endangered.My feelings about this first film in the Alien series have vacillated slightly over the years. I loved it when I first saw it as a young teenager in the theater back in 1979. Later, I wasn't as enamored with it, and had actually rated it as low as a 7 out of 10--at one point believing it to be my least favorite of the series. Now, however, my appreciation of the film has matured a bit, and I'm back to thinking it's a solid 10 out of 10.The film's strong points are rooted in director Ridley Scott's focused commitment to sustaining a desolate, dark atmosphere and gradually building suspense over the course of the film. Alien is unusual for its era in its pacing, its lack of comic relief, and its refusal to provide breaks from its growing tension. All three of these facts make it a somewhat ""difficult film"". It's not recommended for light viewing. It's not a ""popcorn film"". You have to be in the mood to sit down, slow down, concentrate, invest emotion, and let yourself be enveloped in the film's world.With Alien, Scott has created a kind of bleak tribute to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is evident in many characteristics of the film, such as the graceful slowness of the cinematography, editing and much of the action in the first section of the film, including sustained pans across sterile-looking environments and wide external shots of (a) hulking but elegant spacecraft, the personification of the ship's computer, known as ""Mother"" here rather than Hal, a few subtle instances of classical music, the surprise discovery of a monumental structure on another celestial body, and so on. However, there are no instances of pleasant psychedelia here, no retreats into dreamworlds, no messages of hope, no benevolence from alien beings. Alien is strictly concerned with making its sci-fi an issue of classic horror. At a base level, it is about a malevolent monster, first encountered in a dark, Gothic environment and later chasing our heroes through a cross between a haunted house and crypt-like labyrinths.Much has been said about visual artist H.R. Giger's alien and production design, and the film wouldn't be nearly as successful without it. Giger is largely responsible for the look of the beacon ship on the small planet, both its exterior and interior, the cocoon later encountered on the cargo ship, and the creatures. His work also inspired a lot of smaller elements, as can be seen in doorways, pipes, and other features of the cargo ship. Like most of his work, these features are a combination of metallic and organic, mechanical and biological, futuristic and Gothic. They complement the austere Kubrickian sensibility in a surprising but completely successful way.Scott also uses simple effects like steam, as well as unique lighting and sound effects to help build the film's thick tension. These techniques gradually become more conspicuous as the film goes on, finally culminating in a claustrophobic symphony of flashing lights, constantly hissing pipes and hoses, and an incessant audio alarm.Finally, the last key to the excellence of the film is the cast. Although a somewhat stereotypical movie-world ragtag bunch, their characterizations provide more depth than the norm, with Sigourney Weaver as the standout, in perhaps the defining role of her career, and one of the more admirable filmic portrayals of a woman--she's the smartest, most sensible, strongest, and certainly most sexy of the bunch."
"Before gore, special effects, and the denouement of the alien itself in future sequels, this was the movie that revolutionized the concept of the ""haunted house"" and merged it in a seamless sieve with ""body horror"" and its ultimate intrusion into our own most intimate space.The story had been done before, in different genres, never veering too far from its horror origins. Lovecraft (and others) had written about expeditions that had gone to ""investigate"" and ""collect important data"" only to find themselves being hunted down one by one, be it an unseen terror or their own fears.Ridley Scott's ALIEN looks and feels like a science fiction movie. However, it is not. Everything in its look and tone suggests horror of a more cerebral kind. When three crew members come across what seems to be a large space-jockey with a thing attached to its face, dead, we feel our stomach turn. If something that small was able to take over a creature this large, they are in deep trouble here. The scene is masterful, restrained, but a classic in the horror-movie sense: it's as if we had been witness to terrible events which had taken place and decided to get to the bottom of it. Scott tightens the noose employing age-old tricks of the horror genre and only once shows blood and guts -- one which follows a calm dinner sequence. He never allows the viewer to get a true glimpse of this sadistic killer much like Spielberg in JAWS and this becomes nerve-wracking because again, fear of the unseen is more powerful than what comes into view. The theory dictates: ""I was afraid of that thing? I thought it was bigger!"" All we see of this alien are his teeth and in one memorable, twisted scene, his tail snaking up Lambert's (Veronica Cartwright) leg. Later on, as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in her breakthrough role), the quintessential Final Girl, makes her escape, it is possible to hear Lambert shrieking. What the alien is doing to her we can only imagine and recoil."
"Great Sci-Fi film, featuring a lot more realism than any of the films I was raised on as a youngster in the early 1950s. As a nine-year old, I was impressed by _Rocketship XM_ but my dad, who *was* a rocket scientist, laughed throughout it and spoilt it for me. The _Nostromo_ in _Alien_ was a junker tractor rocket; it had *dents* for Christ's sake! So it was real. Most of the crew were derelicts as well, so the fit the ship and the plot. Not too bright, and more than a wee bit clumsy. The Alien was designed by a Swiss (Geiger) who knew his biology. In the insect world, *all* the wasps reproduce by laying eggs on or inside the body of a host, be it a spider or caterpillar. It is now believed there is a separate wasp species for every caterpillar species -- and that's a few! The extrudable alien mouthpiece is an exact copy of a dragonfly nymph's mouth -- he uses it to catch small fish. 'Nother thing about this alien: most early aliens might look scary, but they were dumb and slow. You had to be a total klutz/moron (or a pretty blond) to get caught. *This* alien is smart, very smart, . . . and FAST! Nothing like it before this film. Sigourney Weaver is a delight, Skerrit is a good captain, John Hurt makes a great first meal for Mr. Alien, and Harry Dean Stanton always contributes his own special charm. Then, there's ""Jonesy""!! True star quality!
Talk about pregnant suspense: all you can want and more. The music was ethereal and totally appropriate, great art direction and camera work. A classic, with a light touch to get the best scare out of one.
One other note: After seeing it (and having bad dreams), I needed to go back and see it again! It was even more scary the *second* time because I knew what was going to happen and couldn;t stop it! Talk about living a nightmare, and paying good money to do it! :-)"
"I had seen this a couple of times prior to watching it with the expressed purpose of reviewing the quality of the film. It's a classic - if you live in America and watch movies, then you really can't escape having seen 'Alien' (1979) at least a couple of times. I always thought it was ok - a fine movie. I'm not a sci-fi fan and I don't particularly care for Sigourney Weaver. However, I created this numeric review system since the last time I saw this film, and I have reviewed 130 or so films now for IMDB. Regularly reviewing films with this metric has changed the way I watch a movie. Now, there is this constant comparison in my mind, weighing the qualities of the film I am watching verses all other films of the genre.'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest films of all time. The 1970's effects not only hold up, but are still impressive, due to extraordinary cinematography. Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ripley and she adds surprise sexuality to the film toward the end. The writing shows the ship to be a microcosm of societal conflicts - duty verses survival, equal pay for equal work, and the battle for women's equality in group decision making. And, then there is The Alien. I capitalize his name (or title?) because he is one of the biggest box office draws of all time. Nicholas Cage wishes he had the career of The Alien.This film has some great qualities and no noticeable flaws. I am proud to award it my 6th perfect score.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"In the crowded gallery of horror films, Alien hangs in a prominent position, high above its rivals. By virtue of its deft blend of psychology and physical horror, it lifts the genre out of the graveyard and into deepest space . While its scale models, grimy characters, and shimmering soundtrack may no longer appeal to a generation of audiences who revel in the hotchpotch storyboards of 'Drag Me To Hell', Alien still commands great respect, and rightly so. It has not lost any of its cutting edge, even after thirty-two years. Alien's simplistic premise keeps the film tight and lean; a taut, slow-burning game of cat and mouse involving a vicious, shadowy creature whose acidic blood can melt the very girders of the ship it has invaded, and a compelling blend of the brave (Ripley), cautious (Dallas), and mechanical (Ash). There are no meaningless references to childhood memories or superfluous romance. The characters and their personalities are weathered, believable, and their mission plausible. The profit-driven search for mineral ore provides a realistic corporate counterpoint to the main story, which sees the seven crew members dragged, somewhat unwillingly, into the extraterrestrial's world. With the possible exception of Ash, they did not seek this encounter; the computers lead them to it. How each crew member responds to the situation is key; in effect, seven sub plots form, each focusing upon something different, be it a crew member's mannerisms, their way of thinking, or indeed, a violent death (Chestburster). This is Alien's greatest appeal; it provides an insight into the human mind, as psychological horror movies should. Which crew member do we, the audience, root for, admire, or resent? Who can trust who? Sigourney Weaver, so often credited with inspiring a roll-call of female cinematic heroines, rightly earns every syllable of praise that has been heaped upon her since the film's release; Ripley's resourcefulness and courage are marvellous to behold. However, as the genuinely disturbing android Ash, Ian Holm is supreme; his reserved demeanour and considered approach masking the motives that lay hidden out of sight. As an exercise in sound and vision, Alien is a memorable spectacle. There are many moments that are striking. The colossal hauler Nostromo, futuristic and industrial in design, dominates the screen as it crawls slowly, almost gracefully, towards Earth. The sheen of the soundtrack and the echoing calls from the freighter to 'Antarctica Traffic Control' are atmospheric to the core, while the fogbound alien planet, littered with blackened mountains and the silhouette of the hulking, derelict vessel, is hauntingly desolate. Spaces where, in modern horror films, the gaps would be filled with meaningless dialogue, are left vacant. The viewer can interpret what they see with no need for speech. Ridley Scott's vision of 'horror first, science-fiction second' was, without a doubt, fulfilled; audiences should ignore the flashing lights and controls of the spaceship and focus upon the Alien. Around which corner does it lurk? Who becomes its next victim? Alien is a film of immense quality. It has the capacity to frighten and to deceive. It flows precisely from scene to scene with no wasted shots and most tellingly, does not stray off course by incorporating fanciful special effects or worthless roles filled by fringe characters. One spacecraft, one extraterrestrial, seven humans, and one cat is all we are given. And quite simply, anything more would have been a waste. While the genre of horror may have moved on, the art of horror is captured perfectly, here, in the blackness of space."
"Review 1 of 4Alien is one of those films that will never age. It takes the simplest story and tells it as well as it can be told. I look at this film as the first in a trilogy, many may not agree with that, but Alien is a perfect beginning. It establishes an entire world and makes it feel real. Everything feels new and interesting. The things that are not explained in this film are exactly what makes it so fascinating to watch. Where did that ship come from? It doesn't matter. Like a good novel the film allows you to fill in the pieces with your own imagination. This goes for the alien it self, since we see so little of it that it becomes all the more terrifying for it. Ridley Scott is like a painter with his images. So many frames of this picture seem like they could be made into still photographs. Alien is science fiction and yet with the way it is shot and acted the movie feels like a documentary. It's that sense of verisimilitude that has made this movie last for so long. So much is present in the subtext. I get the feeling that one of the underlying themes of the film is that technology in the future will little by little overtake the lives of human beings, but paradoxically the nostromo still needs a crew in order to operate. I believe this film is one of the few realistic depictions of what encountering a real Alien life form might actually be like, and that it may not be what we are expecting. something that has always stood out to me about the film is the level of familiarity that the characters have with their surroundings. Many science fiction films love to draw attention to their futuristic technology but the characters in Alien react to it like a construction worker would with operating a crane: it is their job. This film is so good for so many reasons. The performances are nothing short of amazing, the set design exquisite, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is subtle and evocative, but the main reason for me that alien still holds up after all these years is that it takes itself very seriously. There is no Hollywood style self referential humor that would saturate the later entries of the series. Sigourney Weaver may have gotten the academy award nomination for Aliens, but her work here is very solid. She plays a character who through much hardship finds strength within herself that never appeared to be there to begin with. If you look at the Alien series as a trilogy this is the film where Ripley discovers who she really is, or defines her character, and the only way one can do that is through the choices they make in extreme circumstances. This is a film of great tension and subtly, well worth seeing over and over again to pick up on all the layers of subtext that may have been missed the first or second viewing."
"I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place. Needless to say, given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo, a merchant vessel carrying, if I remember correctly, something like 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore, there was hardly a lack of companionship. At any rate, I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep. It doesn't matter, because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes. That being said, I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail, which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films. No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody, gory death scenes, the alien, masterfully designed, isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design, we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie. Like Jaws, Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation. The Nostromo is a merchant ship, which allows for a non-military crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand. The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds, and so it wakes up the crew to investigate. The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important. The transmission didn't just appear, the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule, because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen. And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financial-minded crew members, it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence. The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect. When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated, they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship, complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair. A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside, creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to. One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs, gets attacked, and is brought back on board the ship. Significantly, protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention. When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite, a new and particularly difficult challenge arises. How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed? And to make matters worse, the very ship is programmed to work against them. They are in the most hostile environment imaginable, worse than anywhere on earth. They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship, and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival. They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on. Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy.Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been (and possibly ever will be) thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel, Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for, the darker, more sinister and dangerous side. The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes. In fact, by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now, you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years. Back then, this was horror/science fiction. Today, it's science fiction/horror. But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today, it is significant that, while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror, the movie has lost none of its powerful effect. Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it, it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right."
"This is one of the few sci-fi horror films from the period of the late 70s/early 80s that has really held up with time.On a visual level, the film is highly satisfying. Green and light blue colors are saturated throughout the film, but so grayed that the movie almost appears at many points to be shot in black and white. The miniatures and matte effects used in the original film were quite good.The movie works on pretty much every level, though you can't really say it's an incredible story either. On a sci-fi level, the best parts are the early parts where we first see the alien technology. I was disappointed actually in the print that I saw because I believe it was altered with computers, I remember seeing more matte screens that resembled the HR Geiger artwork when the film was on video. Anyway, the alien technology succeeds on a level never before achieved in terms of showing a realistic alien culture. We can almost imagine these creatures living on this ship, it seems to fit in with the alien biology so well.When they arrive back on their own ship, the film unfortunately descends into a fairly typical horror action film. Perhaps taking a note from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", Scott kills off the only reasonably well known actor in the film (at the time of its release), Tom Skerrit, fairly quickly and leaves us with the then-unknown Weaver as the hero. This makes her the first really butt-kicking female heroine of a sci-fi action film, and that alone qualifies this film as groundbreaking.The cast in general is just amazing. Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton -- these are quite simply some of the best character actors of their generation, all gathered for the purpose of making this more than just a typical monster movie. Other films such as ""Predator"" tried but failed to get a supporting cast as distinguished and talented as this one gathered for a sci-fi action film. The quality of these actors makes the film better not only in the individual scenes they are in (such as Holm's incredible turn once exposed), but also the aggregate total of the film -- because the actors are so good and the characters relatively fleshed out, we can imagine right up until the film's final moments that any one of them could be the one who ends up surviving.Another interesting element not often commented on is the cynical attitude the astronauts have towards ""the company"", which employs them. From Kotto and Stanton's character's complaints about the hours, all the way up to Weaver's discovery that all of them were expendable and kept in the dark as to the true purpose of their mission (which Skerrit's character seems to also know more about than Weaver's), there is a kind of dark realism here that you won't find in the vast majority of films of this type. It dovetails with the other element I've talked about, the fact that the cast is so good that any one of them could be the ""hero"" -- this is a very democratic look at the future, one edged with deep cynicism but with an ultimate eye towards presenting a future of real people who are oppressed by situations far beyond their control. It is a far cry from the Utopian dreams of Heinlein and other sci-fi progenitors and represents this film's true gift to science fiction as a whole."
Best aged sci-fi film. Such a classic and well-loved film? Can't praise it enough.

"Alien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...
Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.On plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid conventions.With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.It made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.Now 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly so. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10"
I decided to finally review Alien after watching it on Blu Ray I have seen it many times before and it still blew me away seeing a movie now forty years old still looking better than most modern movies Alien is a classic atmospheric movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish the beautiful direction and camera shots make the movie look incredible even today if you haven't already seen this classic I recommend watching it on Blu Ray and enjoying a classic at its finest.
"This is a masterpiece. From the long, detailed shots of both interior and exterior of the ship, to the fleeting glimpses of the alien, this is cinematography at it's best. The movie is paced slow, in order to build tension, and it was the right decision. Alien paved the way for a whole new genre of movie, scifi horror. Ridley Scott birthed an instant classic, and unfortunately has not been able to repeat such a marvel."
"Alien is one indisputably one of the best science fiction, and horror films ever made. And easily one of the most influential ever. As it basically invented and defined the science- fiction horror genre, paving the way for films like the thing, and predator. One of Alien's best aspects is its amazing cinematography and creature/set design. All of see work together to give the film a visual style that was unlike anything scene at the time and Ridley Scott would re-use in Blade Runner. Alien's magnificent visuals can be strangely credited to Alejandro Jodorowsky, who found and assembled all the different artists used in Alien for his adaptation of the novel dune, which was unfortunately canned before shooting started, but every cloud has a silver lining, and Jodorowsky's Dune's silver lining was Alien. Another one of Alien's best aspects is its pacing and atmosphere, though some people today may call Alien ""boring,"" these people know nothing about film and are not to be trusted. Alien opens with a slow footage of space, as the eerie score plays, open credits come up, and the title is slowly spelled out, this is then followed by a slow montage of the empty ship Nostromo, followed by the crew slowly waking up from cryospleep. In fact we don't see any sign of an alien until 1/3 of the way through the film, and we don't see the main alien until halfway through the film. And this is why some call it ""boring,"" but these people came to see the wrong film, they expected something like predator, a straight forward action film where the hero tries to kill the creature, instead what they got was something more like Halloween or Psycho, a subtle unnerving film that builds tension and doesn't blow its load all at once.The characters in Alien are also far above the average horror movie, they aren't annoying teenagers, or people that we just want to see die. They're relatable diverse logical characters, that have really natural chemistry, as can be seen in some of the films earlier scenes. And another interesting thing about the characters is, we have to figure out which one the protagonist is, it isn't revealed immediately and makes all lot of scenes much more tense because we don't know which characters are going to die. Though Alien begins slow, the final scenes of Alien are some of the most ""on the edge of your seat"" scenes ever, I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who somehow hasn't scene alien yet, but you will most likely be on the verge of a heart attack while watching.One final note, I recommend you watch the original version first, and then you most definitely should watch the directors cut.9.6/10"
"This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , chills , profanity , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . The commercial vessel Nostromo with a crew in deep-space sleep wakes up and receives a distress call from an unexplored planet . The futuristic cargo ship picks up an unwanted passenger : a malicious extraterrestrial . After searching for survivors, the ill-fated crew heads home only to realize that a deadly bioform has joined them . The merciless alien lives on human flesh and continually changes form . Then the Earthlings have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous being that is running amok . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s and 80s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creature by the artist HR Giger , it was conceptual artist Ron Cobb who came up with the idea that the Alien should bleed acid . Extraordinary as well as astounding special effects in the chestburster scenes , the rumor that the cast, except for John Hurt, did not know what would happen during scenes is partly true and it was filmed in one take with four cameras; for instance, Veronica Cartwright did not expect to be sprayed with blood. The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien . ¨Alien¨ is clearly inspired by ¨It ¡ the terror from beyond space¨ . Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship such as Tom Skerritt who is awesome in compelling lead role as commandant , Harry Dean Stanton , Veronica Cartwright , Yaphet Kotto , John Hurt and special mention to Ian Holm . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Ridley Scott who keeps everything bouncing at an absolutely frantic pace . Ridley Scott cites three films as the shaping influences on his movie: George Lucas' Star Wars (1977) and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) for their depiction of outer space, and Tobe Hooper's Texas chain saw massacre (1974) for its treatment of horror .It is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance ; ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet with Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy ."
"How can this movie not get 10 stars? It baffles me. In context, this one came out in 1979. 19 F----ng 79. And it still stands up awesomely today. Let us first investigate the Ash. When did we first realize he was an android? When the milky fluid came spurting from him. Although he was often ""collating"" we never really suspected until his head was bashed in proper. What an incredible character Ian Holmes created. And those little pre-exercise jiggles he did. We just thought he was a bit off, certainly not a robot. And Ripley, a strong female lead. And though the scenes of her in her panties were anti-feminist, she still was the lone survivor, who kicked the Alien out of the airlock. She kicked a-- and everyone will always remember that, especially James Cameron. And what about Tom Skerritt? As captain, he always left the science decision to Ash, as he was instructed to do by the company. He felt he was, ""just the captain,"" though he did ignore basic contamination protocols by letting Caine in with the Alien attached to his face. His acting was perfect, a man who only knows the job he is hired for, compartmentalized, weak, and yet ultimately courageous in his decision to go after the Alien. And Parker and Brett were perfect. Pay attention to how their camaraderie is condensed into a few beautiful scenes. Ridley Scott should be credited for this, as we really get to know the friendship between them quite quickly (as James Cameron does in Aliens). Lambert is great in her nervousness. This is as good an any movie can get, a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, sorry for the spoilers, but rent as soon as possible, it is a piece of American Cinematic History."
Every second of this movie gives me the shivers. Even in the slow moving first half the atmosphere is so ominous and creepy and the acting so excellent that I'm never bored. The movie builds up the tension so masterfully you're on the edge of your seat all the time. I've heard some people say that the effects are dated to which I will answer: No not really. The monster is a man in a suit with some mechanics in the head and while there are a few shots where it's movements seem a little stiff we rarely see it and when we do it's only for a short duration and it actually in many ways looks more real than most CGI creatures of today. The artwork and design is one of the reasons this movie holds up so well to me. The ship looks appropriately old and battered up and the alien itself is pure genius. This movie just keeps thrilling me every time I watch it.
"What makes Alien such an effective horror film is how quiet it is. After all, most horror films make the mistake of equating fear with noise. But that's often a mistake, as silence is usually infinitely more effective. And so it is with Alien. The scariest moments are all devoid of intrusive scoring, jagged editing and overblown sound effects. Instead most of the sound and music is pulled out and shots are held for a long time.One of the best examples is when Brett is killed. He has to chase after a cat and he's led into a dark corner of the ship. You know he's going to get killed but Ridley Scott knows that you know. Therefore the sequence is dragged out. All the time you're waiting. You're waiting for the inevitable. But Scott doesn't rush things. He racks up the tension by having Brett wander for an inordinate length of time and by having him wash his face in a shower of dripping water as chains rattle in the background. And when the Alien does appear, it's not with a sudden jolt. It just appears quietly behind Brett before killing him. And the way that the death is played on the face of the cat, which has a look of almost stunned curiosity, makes the whole sequence rather spooky. It's not really a crash, bang, wallop sort of horror film.Not that there aren't plenty of jump moments. There are actually quite a few. But because the lead-up is so quiet and ominous it makes the pay-off a whole more effective. For example, when Kane looks into the egg. Again the sequence takes its time, but when he finally has a peek and the facehugger leaps out, it has the perfect timing of a great joke.Another fantastic piece of timing is when the Alien takes Dallas. You go through another long, drawn out sequence of him scurrying through narrow air vents before the Alien finally pops out of a dark corner. But although the moment is fantastically timed, the lead up is where the fun lies. Although I do have to say that the lead up is probably the most frightening thing in the film. Dallas scurries through narrow corridors trying to take the Alien out, but you know it's futile. And the dark, claustrophobic corridors are full of iris-shaped doors that open and close slowly and forebodingly, which really does add to the air of dread that fills the sequence. And the tracker is the icing on the cake  it racks up the tension to an even greater extent.The second most frightening sequence is when Ripley is finally alone in the ship. She sets the Nostromo to self-destruct so that she can take the shuttle but then with strobe lights flashing she sees the Alien. She then goes back and tries to reverse the self-destruct sequence, but it's too late. It's frightening because Ripley has to run around the ship, not knowing where the Alien might be. No longer does she have the option of just hiding. And with everyone dead she no longer has anyone to talk to or help her out. She's all alone. But perversely, once everyone's dead, the film finally gets loud. There's a countdown sequence (which is brilliant in the way that it adds tension) and the ship begins to destruct. Just when Ripley might have needed the silence to find out where the Alien is, she has to run around in cacophony of noise knowing that the Alien could be anywhere.But the silence comes back in the final sequence, and it's quite ingenious the way that the Alien is camouflaged in the shuttle. I nearly messed myself when I first saw it as a kid.What I also like about the final sequence is that it's weirdly sexual. Ripley strips down to her underwear and then the Alien appears. And the Alien then begins almost stroking the console it's resting on. And of course, Ripley penetrates the Alien a harpoon. Nice.Another excellent bit of weird sexuality is when Ash the robot tries to choke Ripley with a magazine. He shoves it her mouth and he looks rather turned on as she gags on it. Perhaps robots don't come with all the parts. Perhaps this is his way of venting his frustration. But there's also the way that the Alien kills Lambert. Its tail inches up the insides of her thigh and then you cut away and hear her screaming like she's being violated  the screaming is actually pretty damn chilling. And of course, Kane getting ripped open goes back to the male fear of childbirth. (The birth scene is still great. The blood, the sound and the way it takes the Alien two or three attempts to burst through is fantastic. But I do have to say that the way the Alien shoots off the table looks rather dodgy.) Going back to the Lambert killing, though As well as being chilling, this scene is also quite frustrating because Parker (Yaphet Kotto) gets killed as well. I mean, Parker is just The Man. I swear he could have taken the Alien had it not been for the cowardly Lambert. (It's quite surprising that the coward and the black character survive so long  they're usually the first two to go.) But although I dig Parker, I think Ian Holm as Ash delivers the best performance. It's quite subtle the way that he hints at his true identity  I like the way he jogs on the spot to get his joints working. And he's so smug and slimy. He's more of a villain than the Alien.But I think everything in the film is fantastic  the music, the special effects, the sequence on the alien planet, the production design, the moody atmosphere, the script I just wish I had more room to waffle."
"This movie is still a classic after all these years, and proof at what a master filmmaker Ridley Scott is (the original ""Blade Runner"" is in my top 10 films of all time). Scary, suspenseful, and full of tension, this is what good filmmaking is all about. We already have the 1986 sequel ""Aliens"" queued up to watch (and it's supposedly one of the times when the sequel is better than the original)."
"Horror movies today could take a step back, take a long look, and find their own piece to take. Now, of course, I sincerely believe the film industry should try it's best to be original, although let's be honest, that won't happen. Everything in this movie is perfect, I mean that. The script never falls apart with one of the most steady spaced movies I have ever watched. The acting is unknowingly great, depending on your observations of certain characters. The ship is fully developed, with a crew that does not hesitate in any scene with their brilliant chemistry. The ship design feels dirty and lived in, keeping the advanced look. Every time a button is pressed to put in commands or a lever is pulled the ship responds. The Alien design is many peoples favorites, feeling real. For 1979 this movie is revolutionary in visuals and props, never looking too fake. If there is anything I would have to say this movie does best on, it is the cinematography. Derek Vanlint gave the job of a lifetime, alongside Ridley Scott. Alien is one of my favorite movies if you have never watched it....fix that. Alien, of course, gets a perfect score."
"Alien is one of the first movies directed by legendary 'Ridley Scott' (Blade Runner, Gladiator) The film is a classic in the making. When i first heard about this movie i was around 10 years old, obviously too young to watch the movie, now i am 17 and i have watched it for the first time, now twice i enjoyed it so much. This is honestly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 70s, probably is my favourite Sci Fi movie of the 70s, and one of the best of all time. The Sequel 'Aliens' (1986) was directed by James Cameron, another one of my favourite directors. Director of 'The Terminator' (1984) which stands as my favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time. The reason i didn't want to see Alien when i was younger, was because i always felt scared of the Alien, i used to have horrific nightmares of them just thinking about them. When i went to Disney world, i have always loved Movies, so i decided to visit a Movie ride, the Alien suddenly popped out of the ceiling, of course it was only plastic, but looked real enough. So i had always been too scared to watch the Movie. I didn't know what i was missing out! As i watched it i didn't know what i was worrying about. It's very different to watching it on Screen than seeing for real. I am nearly 18 now, so i am not really scared of anything anymore, i would definitely go back to Disney and try out that ride again, just to see if it still scares me, I think now i've finally seen the movie i appreciate now that it's not real, and i find it interesting than scary now more than anything, because it feels like I'm in the movie. When it comes to Ridley Scott director 'Prometheus' (2012) a prequel to Alien, that wasn't very scary at all, it was more of a mystery than a Sci-Fi/ Horror i thought. Alien is deifinitely a classic in the making, Don't miss Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien!"
"This movie predates my childhood, since I was born at a time when horror was sadly beginning to fade into the cliché standards of today's ""scary movies."" This is the sort of horror movie everyone remembers, and it has stood the test of time like no other movie in the genre (with the exception of, perhaps, Psycho or The Shining) ever has. The phrase 'in space nobody can hear you scream' has never been so effective, and the movie relies on atmosphere to generate this effectiveness. This is a risky decision for any movie developer, since if that atmosphere is not established well enough, then the movie looses all sense of fear and tension. Here, however, this is not the case. The alien is instantly established as a threat - ever since that infamously gory scene in the cafeteria; you all know which one I'm talking about - and this threat, combined with the tight hallways and sense of claustrophobia, is what shapes Alien into the terrifying, chilling movie that is renowned as even more than 25 years later."
"Alien was the first film that started it all. It gave us Aliens in 1986 and then two lesser sequels in the proceeding years. One can not review Aliens and not review Alien because both films go together so perfectly. Even though both films had their different styles, they both had Sigourney Weaver and one of the most fearsome creatures to ever grace the big screen. It's also my second most favorite horror movie of all time behind Jaws, a film I saw when I was just a wee lad.The crew of the Nostromo, a large space freighter that looks immense and incredibly scary thanks to director Ridley Scott's camera work, is awaken early from hyper sleep to investigate what seems to be a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. After a rough landing on the desolate planet, three of the crew members go out to investigate and find a large spaceship. However this is not all they find. Soon one of the crew members, who gets a little too curious, finds himself in a coma-like state with something attached to his face. He is soon brought back to the Nostromo by his shipmates, where they go about analyzing him to see what has happened. But this crew of working men and women have no clue what grisly horrors soon await them because they are no longer alone. Something dark and dangerous with no remorse for humankind will soon be stalking them one by one, and there seems to be nothing on board that is able to stop it.This movie was fantastic in every way. Ridley Scott uses mood and shadows as well as size to make the Nostromo look like the biggest, scariest haunted house ever. He also uses fabulous camera work to get his points across as well.The suspense in this movie builds and builds, and the creature is kept mostly in the shadows until when it attacks. And it attacks with a lethal efficiency. It is never seen for long periods of time, and this works perfectly. Like Spielberg with Jaws, Scott realizes that what is unseen is always more terrifying. One of the most effective murder scenes in this film is unseen, but we clearly hear the horrifying screams and panting of the victim and know that something horrible is happening.I can go on in on about this movie. I can talk about the music score which adds more dread to this film, and I can talk about the acting which was superb, but it would take up way too much space. I can also go on about the Oscar worthy special effects which are probably the best ever for 1979, but I won't. Lets just say this. If you like horror movies that build suspense and are not filled with senseless gore that looks unrealistic, then you are in for a treat. By the way this film does have some bloody scenes. One of the best involves sitting around a dinner table while everybody is eating. Yuk.Many people always compare Alien and Aliens. Some like Aliens the most and some like Alien the most. Both are classic sci-fi horror films by two different directors, and both get my highest marks, but if I had to chose, Alien would be my first choice, followed closely by Aliens."
"In terms of sci-fi horror, Ridley Scott's »Alien« is as good as it gets. As many people have pointed out, the story is basically B-movie stuff: a spooky monster haunts some hapless people, only this time they're in space. Scott stages the rather simple plot like an arthouse flick, beginning with the slick and lifeless introduction to the space ship Nostromo. The atmosphere is unbelievably tense throughout the movie: from the industrial Nostromo, the stormy planet V-426 to the phallic Alien designed by H. R. Giger. In many ways, »Alien« is the antithesis to Stanley Kubrick's »2001: A Space Odyssey«, the most megalomaniac movie ever conceived. Ridley Scott shows us that space travel won't be about philosophical self-discovery. It will be about dirty, senseless work. Of course, there are also some gender issues at stake here. Sigourney Weaever as Ellen Ripley might be most badass last girl in movie history - and maybe the first female action star that is not reduced to her womanhood. If »Alien« has one problem, it's the fact that it betrays its B-movie roots. There is a wannabe-deep scene near the end of the movie that feels affixed, as if Ridley Scott wanted to reconcile the intellectuals in the movie theater. That wasn't necessary at all. Still, if you're into stylish and evocative sci-fi, horror or sci-fi horror, you need to watch »Alien«. Man, what am I talking about? If you're into movies at all, you need to watch this flick."
"""Alien"" is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format! It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film. I was pulled in by the ultra high sense of realism. This film almost feels like a documentary because of a lot of the subtle hand-held camera work (read; not like the shaky, seizure inducing hand-held work of today's films). There's much going on in that film that was revolutionary for the time. Great ideas, design, cinematography, subtle, very realistic performances.Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley in her film debut role. Weaver is absolutely perfect for the role, and was practically the first girl-power type female heroine who single-handedly carries this international blockbuster right through until the final minutes. John Hurt also plays Kane to excellent effect, especially in his death scene as he frantically wriggles on the table with the alien inside him. Harry Dean Stanton is brilliant as Brett, as is Tom Skerritt as Dallas. Yaphet Kotto is also perfectly cast as Parker, who provides many on-screen laughs. Veronica Kartwright (who later went on to star in The X-Files some 20 years later) stars as the lovable Lambert, the only other female member of the crew along with Ripley. Ian Holm as Ash is absolutely brilliant in his role as the android secretly sent on board to bring back the alien life- form, while - in his eyes, and ""Mother's"" - all other crew members are expendable. The acting in this film is really first-rate, which is another big factor in why the film works so well.The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself is right on the money. It amazes me how well visually this movie still holds up. It feels as rich and deep cinematically as most anything today due to Ridley Scott's brilliant visuals. You watch this film at certain points and it feels as slick and polished as any current genre film without the hollowness or incompetence. All in all, Alien is a terrific sci-fi horror movie that plays with your senses incredibly well. Nothing happens for the first 30 minutes, and that is exactly the director's intent. By doing so, a feeling of extreme suspense is instantly formed, leaving you on the edge of your seat until the very end.Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"Usually I don't care for films that have nothing but unlikable characters and a lot of verbal blasphemy, but this was so well done that I just had to have this on a good DVD because I'll always watch this film every few years. It's just too interesting to ignore.The attractions are the incredible suspense; excellent photography and set design and memorable horror scenes. They didn't overdo the action scenes, either, as is so often the case with modern-day films. In fact, some of this might be too slow-moving for today's audience.The suspense, as crew members search for the killer alien, is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast, all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life. I personally applauded when Veronica Cartwright, who had one of the nastiest faces and mouths on screen, met her demise. The rest of the crew wasn't much classier. Since this movie came out, in fact, the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous.Anyway, Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it. Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest? That's a scene that stays with you forever. Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene, but never quite been as successful.The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance. It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott. This is just great entertainment if you want to spend a night on the edge of your seat."
"Despite it's legendary status, the truth is that Alien is just a horror movie set out in space, i.e. the alien monster taking the part of the serial killer that's murdering the cast one by one (minus of course the main character, in this case Ripley - played by Sigourney Weaver). So, nothing original, apart from that it's set in outer space.Then where does that leave us? Well, two things are really of note. H.R. Giger's design of the alien planet and the creature itself - chilling and nightmarish, in what is the brush of a true artist, and also Ash's poetic reflection on the alien monster: ""Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."" ""I admire its purity. A survivor.. unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.""And yet despite the atmospheric approach, it's unclear what angle or view, if any, the film offers. Seemingly it condemns the instinctive effort for survival of the alien creature, yet in the end it's the morally bound humankind which prevails. In fact, the scene in the end where Ripley comes face to face with the alien and kills it by shooting it in outer space is probably the film's center of gravity. The alien creature is for the first time looking insecure and scared of dying, but Ripley (guided by her own instincts) shows no remorse. Here, the roles of the hunter and the hunted are blurred, and so is the moral status of mankind.Other minor themes are the remorseless capitalist stance of the mother/company, which also hides a metaphysical meaning (the company is called mother, it controls the destiny of the crew, has it's own purposes, has it's chosen representative amongst the crew with the robot Ash etc)."
"This one really needs no introduction, this pitch black vision of an unfathomable darkness. If I was asked to run a film class, this would be a prime example to study: collaboration, reinvention, conceptual design that accommodates damage to it, the journey of shared vision from page to space. It does everything right that could easily have gone wrong. The backbone is an extremely coherent space world and mythology, as complicated as we find in Star Wars but with only necessary snippets provided instead of platitudes. On top of that, you have (expertly executed) the age old story of an encounter with ancient evil. But this one has biology, structure that horrifies more. The icing on the cake is a final layer about the nature of the encounter, your encounter with 'alien' vision. Hold this thought.It is amazing to revisit this in retrospect of how much it changed and how much has changed since.In the 1970's, one of the hottest and most troubled film properties for a while was Dune. The scope and detail of Herbert's books called for a a film on a massive scale, a blockbuster, and that was a time when the blockbuster was still a fluid concept. It was a time when you could dream the unthinkable: a 10-hour Jodorowsky extravaganza with the creative involvement of Dali, Welles, Gloria Swanson, Delon, Jagger, designed by H.R. Giger and scored by Pink Floyd. Extensive pre-production work was axed when money decided the venture was impractical, and basically nuts. The world safely went with the Spielberg-Lucas model, nurtured from Jaws to Star Wars. The prevalent business model for a Hollywood blockbuster these days, is a bankable producer-director in charge (he can be a little creative), and contract out the design and effects-work to individual SFX studios. We're getting poorer every year and the products more bland, because of this IKEA mentality.Anyway, the smoke from the colossal Dune collapse turbulently shifted in two directions. We got the two Phillip K. Dick adaptations in the 80's, one of them Scott's Bladerunner. The other is right here. Inbetween, Scott had been next in line after Jodorowsky to tackle and swiftly abandon Dune.What happened, is that a guy called Dan O'Bannon (effects-man in that first Dune) drifted to screen writing to pull himself up from a financial hole. Out of many stories he penned, one was about an alien passenger wreaking havoc mid-space. In its first incarnation, it was going to be a Corman foamcore cheapie called Starbeast. Hollywood tapped the project, considering workingman Aldrich to direct. Daft choice, thankfully axed. This one needed new, excited blood like O'Bannon.Ridley Scott came onboard, fresh and eager from a Kubrick-influenced debut. Kubrick's 2001-notions of cinematic space as a clean and silent roar, elegant design, and controlled visual eddies from symphonic flows of the camera, all of that was carried over into this, and is openly acknowledged in the first shot. O'Bannon(a horror guy) introduced Scott to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and more pieces from the Dune jigsaw: Foss and Moebius were carried over to sketch the world of the film. H.R. Giger was flown in from Switzerland, with alien-designs so disturbing he was held over at LAX.And that is how it came together. The story was recycled from spare parts (Forbidden Planet, Planet of the Vampires), dressed in 'used' scrapyard aesthetic and Giger's diseased-looking biology, and finally given Texas Chainsaw- violence in the engine gears and fabric. And the nature of that collaborative encounter with the product of vision is sketched in the actual film, in the way it made a difference.You have a colorful bunch of professionals in the same 'ship', each one a specialist in his field. Each one has his own logic about what the voyage is all about, but not necessarily equal say. They are earthbound before a beacon signals from the void.It isn't until later that we find out a narrative of discovery had been set in motion around them, and that narrative is controlled by non-human agents, actual devices (Mother - Ash), which is why it's both simple and precise. The actual author won't be seen until Prometheus, one of many things mucked-up there.The discovery is of something that we go on to understand has structure and design, and the instinct to do as designed challenges human conscience. And this is why Scott's presentation matters: it is not a guy in a suit we see, it is abstract shape, pure organism morphing before our eyes.The second expansion is that it is not the story of explanations that matters, but the journey to retrieve new vision. This has been obscured, because that vision is a monster, and because on both ends of that story (Weyland - Engineerworld), you have only vague bits of clearly engineered worlds that we want to know more about (hence, the heavy Alien fanfiction that distracts by too much clarification).It's all here though. The story was something to get you to where the void signals.The real deal is in how we come to terms with something that is new and seemingly dragged strange and whole from the void.And it takes a dissonant - human - element to muck up the precise Weyland gears of the narrative, and actually give birth to the thing. A machine would never be curious enough to touch the egg.This is brilliant. It's all in the coordinated bursts of machine-reason to human-chaos to inscrutable creature-reason and back again, and the way that is choreographed into an environment that bleeds and bursts into our vision (best seen in the discovery of the alien ship). Our vision itself is the alien being born, space impregnated and convulsing with the process."
"Believe it or not, I had never seen an Alien film. What prompted me to actually see it was the fantastic Prometheus trailer that debuted. Even if the film turns out to suck (which I really doubt) it would still have been worth it to watch the original Alien.What can I say? Fantastic. The music, the slow-paced nature of the first half, together with increasing tension as the film goes along is incredible. Once stuff hits the fan, it never lets you go. The film is also quite scary, an it made me jump various times. Why? It knows how to build tension incredibly, and the final 20 minutes are truly perfection. Both the sound and visual effects work to make the film a very effective experience, as does the wonderful cinematography. Bring on the Aliens, bitch!"
"Not only a movie, but also a master piece artwork, the beginning of a sci-fi horror movie universe and the lighthouse of the mist oceans"
"Alien (1979)The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror BreedIt's hard to believe how fresh and scary this movie was at the time, but it's also a relief to see it still holds up as a well made movie even now. Is it a classic great movie? Almost, almost. But not quite, in the end--mostly because of some clichés and goofs in the acting and dialog--although it has really great moments. And it's a great way to discover director Ridley Scott's unique style.Certainly now that H. R. Giger the artist has gotten famous in his own right, the alien itself deserve special mention. And the sets are impressively otherworldly and familiar at the same time--not only the huge and hugely baroque ship, but the interior scenes on the planet toward the beginning. These are marvels whether or not your style (and for my money, the alien is a really improbable type of extraterrestrial, more at home in a comic book Hades than actual space). Another novelty to note, probably a product of the shift in movies in general since the 1960s, is the director's intention to keep things real and everyday. Things are dirty, people worry about their paychecks, and so on. This is a long way from the sterility of 2001 though head to head the earlier Kubrick film is on another level of art. I know a lot of people would rather be entertained, though, and Alien is entertaining. It's fast, it's scary, it's gory, it's messy. It's surprising. It's beautiful. And it spawned a whole series of follow-ups, the next one confusingly called Aliens (1986), also a very good take on the new genre.I first saw this when it came out in Colorado and it was on a huge, curving screen that wrapped around the audience, and I was really, truly scared. Now, thirty years later, the scary parts are still really scary, and it's edited so quickly you won't spend more than a minute on any one scene that doesn't quite click. Horror sci-fi has never been the same since."
"When you wacth the alien, you will be scary, cause the movie very horor and this perfect movie in 1990an. So, think you all must wacth!"
"What else is there to say about this masterpiece of movie? I mean there is great effects, dope set design, blood, and my favorite protagonist of a horror movie ever."
"They don't go any better in Sci-Fi/Horror. Even tho it shows its age --computers, technology, props and costumes- it grabs you like a hook in your belly from the start. Young Sigurney Weaver and Veronica Cartwright provide a high breeze of fresh air in the otherwise oppressive mouldy interiors. It was Ridley Scott at his best, along with other early masterpieces like his much accoladed debut 'The Duellists'. It is one of those films that set landmarks and that you don't tire of watching time and again. You will find yourself longing towards the era when films were created with physical props and costumes instead of present CGI gluttony. One of the true choice films for your top 100."
"This film is such a masterpiece, it has a very good plot, very interesting characters, is the coolest a sci-fi horror alien movie, wonderfully acted, also every scene is perfect. A movie that you will enjoy and love. The alien o creature is also spectacular"
"Visually stunning. Sounds and score of despair. Down to earth and beliveable acting. Slow paced, yes, but that's a good thing. It is building the tension, minute by minute. The menace take its time...but when it comes...it delivers. The script is to the point - simple and complex at the same time. The direction is superb...Ridley Sott is a legend and this partly why. And finally...Sigourney Weaver is amazing as our hero, Ellen Ripley. Alien is the ultimate scifi horror classic."
"The settings in this film are exhilarating and claustrophobic, the characters are funny and likeable and we want them to survive, the creature is horrifying and vile, and the storyline is tense and exciting. This might be the most popular alien franchise ever made (there are more sequels for this than there are for ""Predator""), and that's a well-deserved title. Personally, this is in my top ten science fiction films (and maybe in my top ten horror films as well); it's a movie I'll return to multiple times over the course of my life, and its one I doubt I'll ever grow tired.

"Alien has something that current horror movies lack and that is fear of the unknown. For a good portion of the movie, we didn't know what the alien looked like. Alien builds up tension by not showing us what the alien looked like or what it was doing.
The characters were amazing during the whole movie. They weren't there just for the alien to kill, they actually had characteristic unique to them. Each character felt real and relatable.
The best part of the movie was definitely the alien. Like I said above the alien was never shown completely without purpose. It was moving with the intention of killing everyone on board.
Ridley Scott direction was excellent. From the atmosphere to how the alien goes on board the ship, everything was on point. I loved the atmosphere of this movie, it was a claustrophobic during most of the movie.
This film is not an action film, so it doesn't have fast sequence moments; this movie takes its time and is a very slow pace. But, that is what makes it work."
"I've seen this movie many times before but just watched the Director's Cut for the first time. Besides a couple of scenes with very dated special effects, it has aged very well and remains a classic that set up all the rules for this type of movie. Younger generations may think it's a bunch of predictable, overused tropes but they should keep in mind this is the movie that inspired everything else they might have seen!
Having watched the original Blade Runner recently to prepare for Blade Runner 2049, it's also interesting to notice how much of the atmosphere and gritty elements/shots in Alien help mold what would become another genre-defining movie for Ridley Scott."
"It is quite a few years since I first sat down to watch 'Alien', my anticipations being that it would be like any other Sci-Fi film of the period. To say that this film changed my life may be a slight overstatement but it certainly changed the way I view Film and Cinema! The opening titles (accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's thoroughly creepy score) give the tone of what is to come. The crew of a commercial star freighter are awakened by their onboard computer as it has picked up a 'signal' from a small planetoid in a nearby system. Obliged by Company Rules to investigate, they set down and find a completely non-human ship crashed and (apparently) derelict. One of the crew descends into the bowels of the ship - to be confronted by a chamber full of ovoid shapes...unwisely he decides to take a closer look...and things spiral out of control from that point....What makes this Film SO great is that it is almost shot in a semi-documentary style - the shaky camera footage on the helmet cams, the dark foreboding atmosphere and the quite slow pace - all are deliberately and slowly drawing the audience in. Alien sometimes comes close to being a 'Science Fiction Art-Film' - and so it is - in a way. The designs are extraordinary - with Swiss Artist H.R. Giger designing the absolutely frightening ALIEN of the title. Scott's visuals are astounding and introduced him to Hollywood as a real talent. The pace picks up through the second half of the film - the effects were all done 'in camera' - no CGI here - just old fashioned film making. Scott ensures you never quite see the creature, which adds to the menace and sense that you are trapped in there with it. The sequence in the air shafts is superb - a gripping piece of cinema, as is Alien's most celebrated scene - the 'birth' of the monster.We tend to forget now that, back in 1979, it was not the norm to have a 'female hero' - Scott deliberately went and made 'Ripley' a female to set against audience expectations - thus when Captain Dallas falls, the audience were now wondering what to expect. Everything about this production is first rate and Ridley Scott has never really been better (unless you compare with Blade Runner). Sigourney Weaver - a then unknown - shows that strong female leads are the future.
It is difficult to underestimate the impact of this Film on Science Fiction in general - this really WAS the first time that a Sci-Fi Film was shot, designed and delivered in a totally realistic way - which is why audiences believed it and were scared to hell. This Film so impressed me that I started to watch other Genres, older cinema - it gave me the 'gateway' into the history of Film. It will forever be may most treasured cinematic experience...If you have never seen this - prepare to shocked, scared and blown away with some of the most stunning visuals in this Genre."
"Alien is a film that needs no introduction, it deservedly recreated the Sci-Fi / Horror genre in a significant way, of which the shock waves are still being felt to this day. From the establishing shots alone, Ridley Scott showcases an eerie visual flair that puts the viewer on edge from beginning to end. The empty corridors, heavy shadows and a hauntingly subtle score create an uneasy atmosphere that is almost as intimidating as the creature itself. Speaking of, the Alien creature is a masterpiece in costume design, with an iconic look taken from H.R Giger that still holds up to this day, in part of course due to the excellent lighting that only allows for glimpses of the monster, preying upon the viewer's fear of the unknown. Moreover, the small cast of unfortunate Space Truckers creates a level of grit and realism to the characters as a result of the excellent dialogue and acting. The iconic Chestburster scene alone demonstrates the film's use of shock value, expertly crafted special effects and unrelenting tension to culminate in a hauntingly gruesome scene. In space, no one can hear you scream."
"There are many so-called scary movies, but the scariest ones are those that play out in our mind. Where your imagination completes the picture and your brain delivers the jolt of horror! Alien is one such movie! I saw it first at 15 and was scared out of my wits, and it really was not until my 20s that I could look at the whole movie without goosebumps.Now, after watching the movie perhaps 100 times, I am still attracted to it and drawn into it. But my perception of it changes. Having seen it today again on TV, I realized the really positive message was that the CAT has survived :) The Nostromo crew is dead and the ship destroyed, a colony would be set up on the planet and destroyed again, Ellen Ripley loses her daughter and ultimately her life, but the Weyaland-Yutani Corporation prospers. Everything sucks except the cat makes it! And that is good :)Bottom line: Cat 1 - Alien 0"
"In a seemingly abandoned spaceship, the silence is interrupted by an incoming signal. An automatic program wakes the crew up from hibernation. Disoriented, they assume they're close to home: earth. But no, they're still only halfway there. The signal that was picked up by the ship comes from an unknown origin on an unknown planet and they, the unprepared crew of a simple cargo ship, must go out to investigate. And nothing can prepare them for what they will encounter...This slow burn horror masterpiece gives you the chills, even today, and will keep doing it for years to come. It works because of the practical effects, because of the brilliant directing because of the acting, because of the music, because of the set pieces... should I continue?The futuristic universe 'Alien' takes place in is put before us and is compellingly realistic. With several winks at Kubric's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) in the design of the ship and the momentary hint of classical music, it creates a sense of familiarity, yet in the ships' largely industrial-gothic appearance it puts us on guard as well. Their technology is being explained, but only when the characters absolutely need to mention it. The rest stays unsaid, but is made clear by other aspects of the movie than dialogue.If that alone is not enough to prove that Ridley Scott is a cinematic genius, we'll talk a bit more about him. He delivered his vision of a movie that's 'Jaws in space' the way he wanted it and the way we needed it. Scott makes movies the way no one has ever seen one: visually renewing, with a whole new believable world to tell a story in (also take a look at 'Blade Runner' (1982), 'Gladiator' (2000), 'The Martian' (2017) ...). This one in particular is one of my favourites in terms of style.
Take the design of the hostile Alien creature (the Xenomorph). When shown the work of Swiss artist H.G. Giger by screenwriter O'Bannon, he saw the potential it possessed and had Giger design the creature. The result is as terrifying as it is artful. Appearing as vaguely human, but out of this world in all its aspects.
The characters in the first drafts of the script were unisex and could be filled in by both men and women. The studio bosses, all white old males at the time, off course demanded the leading role to be an man. But, Scott said no. In his vision, the main character was a woman, simple as that. And let's be honest, without Sigourney Weaver, this movie would never have been as good as it is. She (the whole cast to be honest, but especially her) had me gasping for breath again and again. Her panic and determination are compelling.
All this, and the way he ingeniously builds scenes where the tension gets unbearable and the way he added and cut scenes in order to tell the full story without interrupting the flow of the film, prove that he is one heck of a film maker.This is also a feminist movie, although many will argue that it was never intended to be. But the result is a feminist movie nonetheless. Not only is the main character a woman, outstandingly brought to life by Sigourney Weaver, the underlying themes of the movie are feminist as well. Because actually, this is a movie about rape. And here, it's not only the women that can fear unwanted penetration, but also the men. This rape-theme, executed by the so-called 'Face-Huggers', is unsettling for all viewers. Also notice the phallus-like design of the Alien creatures.The tension is guided by the subtle score of Jerry Goldsmith. The panting flutes, the wailing violins, the assaulting brass section and the beautiful main theme. It is a composition that is unmatched in the horror genre. And where modern scores for scary movies, mean nothing more than a scary addition to the film, this modernist score truly tells a story on its own.'Alien' is, all snobbish intellectual analyses put aside, in the first place one of the best horror films ever made. It gives everyone the creeps, it lingers and it's pure art. And come on: there is a cat! How can you not like this movie? But what makes it truly great, is the fact that when you look a bit closer, there's more to it than meets the eye at first.And remember, if you ever get to journey through our solar system or beyond...
In space, no one can hear you scream."
This movie set the standard. Scary. Stylish. Great actors. Great drama. Great story. All the others just want to get to this level!
"Tonight I got the chance to view the perennial sci-fi horror classic in all its glory on the big screen, celebrating 40 years since its inception, and my god does it stand the test of time.Derek Vanlint cinematography is masterful to say the least, perfectly embodying the elements of horror through utilising claustrophobic camerawork and a bleak blue and grey colour palette, however, it's his use of lighting that truly captures the chilling overtones. Shafts of light seep in through vent grates, puncturing the smoky atmosphere in abundance, strobe lighting creates a sense of agitation as the creature hunts the crew members one by one, whilst flurries of neon blue and red shimmers ground it to its science fiction roots.The sound, or lack of, further builds unease, with Jerry Goldsmith's humming drone of a score crafting an eerie tension that only erupts when utterly necessary, standing as one of the first films to EFFECTIVELY utilise jump scares. The use of clanging chains and scraping metal highlighting the anxiety being established alongside impressive and colossal sets. The production design is utterly stunning, from the confined corridors of the Nostromo to the vast expanse of the alien world.This film will forever remain an exemplary addition to the sci-fi genre. Gorgeous and terrifying cinematography, a haunting score, immense set design and some brilliant performance from the main cast, that aided in creating one of the greatest female action heroines of all time, upping her game further in Cameron's follow-up action flick. 'Alien' is truly masterful."
"The very first movie of the Alien movie franchise and definitely one of the best sci-fi movie of all time and for me, the best movie in the whole franchise. Despite being an old movie, the props are UNREAL. It's unbelievably realistic, fascinating and the details are gruesome yet magnificent.
It's bewildering how someone could think of such story in 1979 where the whole alien-conspiracy was not a hit. and what's more amazing is how clear they plot is. No filler and needless details. The movie certainly gives a very tense feel even until the very end.
If i didn't know what time the movie was made, i would've guessed it was made in the 2000s. Definitely a must watch because it lives up to everyone's expectation. They still put a little bit of moral value in this movie-- that science is not necessary if it means putting humanity at risk. All the casts successfully portray their characters."
"Alien is a chilling suspense thriller set in space. Directed in 1978 by Ridley Scott, this film is important to me, as I admire the techniques used in order to generate a response in the viewer.Back in 1978, the director couldn't rely upon today's modern digital effects to grab the audience's attention. Instead, he relies upon techniques such as camera angles, a clever set design, and a superb soundtrack to slowly build tension and create feelings of fear, vulnerability and intimidation within the audience.It is at least half an hour into the film before the audience are aware of the extent of the horrors that follow. Until then, the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what we should be afraid of only adds to the tension. The eventual release of the tension, which has gradually built up, inevitably has more impact.The film is set in a time and place unknown to us. However there are several ideas in the film which we can recognise and relate to, making the story believable, therefore more frightening.For example, the idea of travelling far in space for the purposes of a mining expedition is something which the viewer could accept as likely to be happening in the future. Also, the seven characters on board the ship have an obvious class system, something which we can all relate to in any work environment.These are some of the qualities which make Alien so popular, making it an inspiring piece of film making."
"First of all, for a sci-fi movie made in the end of 70s - and it doesn't look and feel silly for the most part - it deserves a high rating just for that. 
We can only imagine how innovative this looked almost 40 years ago. Great flick overall, I only have some issues with the plot which takes away from the experience - it's just too damn unrealistic. By the logic of this plot, the human race has to be the dumbest space-faring species ever, just too stupid to survive. Heavy spoilers: 
Stumble upon an unknown weird sounding signal in deep space, which noone understands. Witout analyzing it, assume it's a distress signal and go to investigate this with an unarmed cargo ship with a crew of 7. Perhaps just to observe a bit closer? Yeah OK makes sense so far. Find out the signal is coming from an unknown planet in an unknown solar system, and immediately decide to land on that planet without further observation or even consulting Earth command or anything. OK, getting sketchy... After landing and partly wrecking the ship immediately go outside in an alien world you know almost nothing about - without any idea who or what you'll be up against. Find an alien structure undoubtedly created by an intelligent lifeform, and immediately climb into it. So yeah then find a huge alien corpse who by the looks of it died a violent death, all the time touching everything. Then go climbing into some dark caves - sure why not! Then find a field of huge eggs and go stuble around them and of course go touching these also - might as well... if you already did all the above! 
In the meantime back on the ship the crew learns that the signal looks like a warning. And although they have live video feed from the team outside, they can't or won't warn the team about this crucial information. And so on and so on... Ripley is the only one with a sense of reason and she does warn everyone along the way... however it's just not enough for all this to make any sense - her very reasonable warnings should already be in the protocol in such cases. Umm.. like shouldn't the safety of the crew and ship be prio 1 etc? The lack of realism also extends to acting here and there - after 2 crew members horribly killed, the captain is still calm as a coma like it's an everyday thing his crew members get butchered by deadly aliens on his cargo ship. He's talking up his plan like he's ordering a damn pizza - without any signs of stress or worry whatsoever. Sure it's sci-fi and about the unknown, but in order to have a better impact an be more submersive as a movie, the plot should still makse sense in the areas that ARE known - like human behaviour and probable space-faring protocols that should follow some common sense. The same events and suspense could have been backed up by better screenwriting - like they would have followed protocols which made sense in the first place - but some things went wrong etc. And the immersion and suspense would have been better because of increased realism. So 7/10 for lack of realism, for an otherwise great ride into the unknown."
"Alien is directed Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver in her breakout role as Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut that belongs to a crew that receives a distress call from an unexplored planet while in space. They respond to the call by landing on the planet, and searching it. They seemingly find nothing, but, upon leaving, find an unwanted visitor aboard their ship. Once they figure out that this ""alien"" is superior to humans in most every way, the film becomes a battle to either kill, or at most escape, the deadly creature.This film is widely considered one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can really see why. I can also see why some consider it one of the best films of all time. Alien is teeming with suspense, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat for almost the entire run time, say for some exposition in the beginning. Every time the audience gets even a subtle glimpse of the beast, each and every time there's a subtle jump, singularly due to the amazing practical effects of the alien itself.To start with some pros, the directing is utterly fantastic, to say the least. Ridley Scott does such a good job working the camera; it makes every emotion pop right out of the screen and suck the watcher right into the movie, drawing out the tone drastically. Some of the long takes can pull forth the tension throughout the scene, or the fear that a specific character feels at the present time.The acting is also amazing, starting with Sigourney Weaver. She gives one of the most breathtaking female performances in cinema history. Her character, Ellen Ripley, is a very strong and independent female; one in which no male is required to make her who she is, unlike most female leads today. If movies delivered more characters like Ripley, films would be better in almost every way.The hands down best thing about this film, however, is the simplicity of the plot. One can only imagine a person pitching the idea for this film, saying ""a crew of astronauts are stuck on a ship with an alien that kills them."" The straightforwardness of the plot is so astounding, it makes one do a double take upon the complexity of a horror, or even action, film in the modern day. This simplicity is present in many ""best films of all time,"" such as Die Hard (1988), or Jaws (1975). Overcomplicated plots are one of the many reasons why too many movie goers say ""they don't make'em like they used to.""Overall, Alien is understandably one of the best films of all time, thanks to the characters, directing, and clarity of the plot. I'm going to give Alien an A+, or a 10 out of 10."
"What can be said that hasn't already been said, nothing that's what. One of the best in the genre to be made and best effects for it's time. They simply don't make films like this anymore Hollywood won't risk it or this generation won't appreciate it. One of the great strengths of ""Alien"" is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences.Today's slasher movies, in the sci-fi genre and elsewhere, are all pay-off and no buildup.The result is a film that absorbs us in a mission before it involves us in an adventure, and that consistently engages the alien with curiosity and logic, instead of simply firing at it.We have now descended into a bog of Gotcha! movies in which various horrible beings spring on a series of victims, usually teenagers. The ultimate extension of the genre is the Geek Movie, illustrated by the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which essentially sets the audience the same test as an old-time carnival geek show: Now that you've paid your money, can you keep your eyes open while we disgust you? A few more ambitious and serious sci-fi films have also followed in the footsteps of ""Alien,"" notably the well-made ""Aliens"" (1986) and ""Dark City"" (1998). But the original still vibrates with a dark and frightening intensity."
"This is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made. Amazing acting, Amazing lighting, Amazing sets and outstanding effects. None of the new modern day films can even come close to this Master piece. Now days Hollywood think they can spend millions on special effects and just get some hot chic to play the main character just to please all the teenage pop culture fans and think the movie is going to be good. But they are so wrong.. Alien 1979 is a one of a kind film and I hate to say it but, we may never see anything like it ever in this life time. I can seriously put this movie on loop and watch it over.. and over.. and over. Its just the most beautifully crafted film in the history of movie making. Alien will always be king. Always."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece, pure and simple. If there is still anyone who somehow haven't seen it (i can't imagine how could that be even possible), do your self a favor a watch it, not with your friends on Friday evening, but alone and let this movie blow you away. I saw this picture for 5-7 times in my life, and the last time i did (actualy today), was on my 2m x 2m screen projector with all sound system ready to roll. This is timeless film because of many things. The atmosphere, the rising tension, the craftsmanship of the scenes, acting - it all works here because they are not overplayed, and build on seemingly simple approach. 15 minutes into this movie again i caught myself that i forgot everything and i was in there, with them. Thats because of the script, directing, acting - it's all in the first place here, not settings, which still looks great - a bit dated, maybe, but it's not Star Wars type movie were visuals have to be sharp - ""Alien"" shows things in shadows, moody style to create feeling of uncertainty, and it does it brilliantly - that is why this movie is never going to age. Please don't ever compare it to even superior (in my opinion) ""Aliens"" - ""Alien"" is different kind of a movie, it's purpose was to scare people with deadly and very claustrophobic atmosphere, settings and the creature itself, to feel people uncomfortable (in a good way) knowing that no one is safe here and around every corner there could be your end - just look at the close ups near the end of the movie, or shoots where camera is showing person and a deep dark space behind him, thats were imagination starts to fill the darkness.Overall, 10/10 for one of the greatest achievements in the art of movie making."
"While there is a general resemblance to the classic pulp sci fi film, ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", Alien is an expertly crafted and thoroughly original film. In my opinion, it is also vastly superior to all of its descendants, including James Cameron's action and special effects smorgasbord, Aliens.As a teenager, I was so intrigued by the premise of this movie that I was one of the few people in the United States who went out and purchased Alan Dean Foster's book ""Alien"" and read it before the film was released. The book was actually very good, so I knew I was either in for a big treat or a total disappointment when I went to see Ridley Scott's Alien on opening night. Of course, there was no disappointment.Scott assembled a great cast, none of whom (at the time) had a great deal of face recognition except, perhaps, Ian Holm. He placed his characters in stasis aboard a long distance freight ship (""the Nostromo"") owned and operated by a mining company. The ship is grimy, a little broken down, and a bit cramped. The habitat module is one very small portion of this enormous commercial barge.The film uses sound beautifully. Both the amazingly haunting and memorable postmodern soundtrack and excellent soundscape are flawless. The film opens with the ship's computer beginning to power on the ship's systems, and even though the scene consists of nothing but sound effects and mostly immobile hardware, it is permanently burned into my memory.The crew is awakened, and unlike most sci fi films, almost immediately begins complaining about being brought out of stasis early and bickering about how much they should be paid for what appears to be an extra duty. Soon, we learn that a communication signal has been picked up on a planet nearby and the Nostromo's shuttle must descend to the planet and investigate.All of this is established effortlessly by Scott's fantastic directing, cinematography and editing, but rather than spoiling any aspect of this brilliantly plotted and presented story, I will discontinue my plot summary here and move on to the critique.Ridley Scott has directed two of the best science fiction films of all time - Bladerunner and Alien. These two films are completely different and also radically innovative for the sci fi genre. Alien reintroduces realism the the genre. The crew is not a bunch of heroic freedom fighters or righteous warriors. Instead, they are corporate staff members and a couple of administrators - a captain (Skerrit) and first officer (Weaver) who are the company management representatives, mechanics, a science officer/ship's surgeon, a navigator, and geologists (it's a mining company). The ship itself is not a sterile faster-than-light Maserati in space, but a gritty, messy, cramped, barge. And the alien is TRULY ALIEN. 'nuff said about him.H.R. Giger's organic/cybernetic art enhances the other-worldliness of all of the scenes that take place off of the Nostromo, and of course, the design of the alien itself. An enormous contribution that should not be overlooked.It doesn't really matter which version of this film you see. They are all terrific. The director's cut adds a couple of scenes which appeared in the book, but were left out of the original release. Personally, I don't think these scenes really add much to the film, but it is a matter of personal taste, since all of the versions I have seen are 10s.Recommended for anybody who can tolerate sci-fi."
"In many ways, the first ""Alien"" can be described as the sordid underbelly of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Instead of pristine white interiors and clean-cut young men in shorts we have the cramped interior of a grimy, smelly cargo ship with a surly and contentious crew. This is as far from the perfect world of ""Star Trek"" as you can get. The men are unshaven, and everyone smokes, drinks, and uses bad language. Tom Skerritt as the captain does little to inspire confidence, and the only person who knows what she's doing is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who ironically becomes the only survivor, launching Sigourney Weaver's career as a star and becoming the first female action hero in film history (unless one counts Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz."") It's interesting how the imagery of this film influenced later science fiction, particularly the series ""Red Dwarf."" In terms of plots, ""Alien"" follows the general outline of the classic slasher film ""Halloween,"" with Ripley in the Jamie Lee Curtis role. The alien creature is still probably the most repulsive monster in movie history; unlike ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial,"" this is a first encounter that is anything but joyous."
"Commercial star ship Nostromo, returning from a routine mission, are detoured when an alien SOS is intercepted. Awakened from hypersleep, the crew are obligated to land on the alien world where the call for help has originated, but the ship is slightly damaged during the landing process and three of the crew set out to explore the hostile new world. They come upon a derelict spacecraft, the skeletonized remains of an alien creature with an odd wound in its chest and a cache of strange egg-like objects. Crew member Kane is brought back from the exploration unconscious and with a bizarre, crab-like creature attached to his face. He is still alive, and indeed, the creature on his face seems to be keeping him alive for reasons unknown. The Nostromo is repaired and the crew leave the desolate planet behind. The crab creature soon leaves its perch on Kane's face and dies, and Kane emerges from his coma, apparently in good health. But the purpose of the alien soon becomes terribly clear; Kane has been impregnated with an alien embryo which births itself from his chest in a shower of blood and gore, killing Kane and escaping into the ships air ducts before anyone can react. The crew set out to destroy the creature, not realizing immediately that its accelerated growth has transformed it into a huge and vicious predator whose only desire is to kill them all.Very loosely based upon the 1958 horror film ""IT! The Terror From Beyond Space"" Alien is a masterpiece of Gothic horror, a haunted house movie on a spaceship. Flawlessly directed by Ridley Scott, Alien, whose plot is actually fairly simplistic and nothing new, is so filled with dread, so claustrophobically genuine, that it seems like nothing ever seen before. Ghostly steam, clinking chains, long dark corridors where anything can be hiding, the suspense is unbelievably suffocating. We never really get to see what the alien actually looks like until films end, and so the quick flashes of tail, head and mouth are so brief and so confusing that it only adds to the horror. Plus, Alien does what no ghost story can do - there is no way out of this ""haunted house."" There is no escape from the horror within.The performances are all outstanding. The alien is not the only menace to the all-too human crew; there are also soulless corporations and short circuiting androids to be dealt with on top of everything else. Faced with these dilemmas, every single crew member of the Nostromo are absolutely believable. They're tired, stressed out, rude and bitchy and they spend a good lot of time griping and snapping at each other, but they drop what they're doing and stand together, protecting one another without hesitation when they must. The gore is minimal; the death of Kane is the bloodiest, nastiest moment in the whole film and because Kane, played by John Hurt, seems to be the nicest of the crew members, it just makes his painful death scene all the more horrible.Alien is a grim, visceral, satisfying horror film and remains the unsurpassed best film in the series. Alien is an established classic and should not be missed."
"I wasn't real impressed with this movie because it seemed like any other horror movie, but in a science fiction setting. In fact, I believe that was the secret to the movie's success. Take your typical horror movie plot - a monster is stalking a group of people, killing them one by one - and set it in the future, in space, and you've got Alien. It probably attracted a lot of science fiction fans to horror and horror fans to science fiction.From a more esoteric standpoint, I was disappointed that the settings were so dark. Maybe it worked on the big screen, but it failed in my living room.
Credit-wise I'm curious to know why Tom Skeritt had top billing over Sigourney Weaver. The latter's character is obviously our hero and has all the best lines, while the former's character is killed halfway through the movie. It would be like giving Jack Palance top billing in City Slickers, although he contributed much more to that movie than Skeritt contributed to Alien."
Alien has a slow and mysterious beginning. It starts like nothing special - some people eating and talking on a space ship. But it gets more intense when they detect an unknown planet and land on it so they can explore it. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching.
"I love science-fiction, but as for horror films, I'm not particularly fond of them as a genre. Most of them are cheaply done, badly written, even downright ridiculous, and not frightening at all. There are some exceptions, however. There are a handful of movies that I consider genuinely scary (movies that give you at least one or two sleepless nights, like The Exorcist or David Lynch's surrealistic nightmare, Eraserhead) and Alien is the best of them all.I have seen Alien countless times and it never ceases to amaze me. None of its sequels or prequels managed to reach such a level of perfection (although I liked them all with the exception of Alien3). The production design (especially H.R. Giger's creations) and the visual effects do not feel dated at all even after all these years. The eerie music and sound effects still make your hair stand on end. The sequence inside the interiors of the derelict ship, the eggs, the facehugger, the 'birth scene' – all iconic moments that are just as shocking today as they were in 1979. The cast are all impeccable, but the multi-faceted Ian Holm (Napoleon & Love, Brazil, Lord of the Rings) and Sigourney Weaver deliver especially mesmerising performances. (I consider Weaver's performance in Alien her best in the series.)Ridley Scott's blood-curdling classic is a must-see for every SF and every movie fan."
"Simply put this is horror perfection. The detail in the film is down to a tee. From the score all the way down to the acting. The set was deliberately made to be as claustrophobic as possible by Scott and it plays a vital role in the whole tone of the finished film. The acting is perfect in terms of the necessary tension needed for the film and the cast is star studded for the day (albeit Sigourney Weaver was a relative unknown at the time). The beast itself is the ultimate in horror terror and nothing will ever be scarier on screen, especially seeing as though it's all computer generated nowadays, and the fact that you don't see a lot of the beast adds to the tension and fear. The pacing is a bit slow to start with but rips into the action when the face hugger makes it's debut appearance. The tagline is 100% the best tagline in the history of film, and goes extremely well with the setting of space. It's got to be said that horror doesn't get any better than this. Absolute perfection. 10/10."
