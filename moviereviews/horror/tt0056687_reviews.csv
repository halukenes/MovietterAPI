"Ryan Murphy's series ""Feud"" in which Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon play Joan Crawford and Bette Davis at the time of Baby Jane and beyond. I got so engrossed the series that I had to see What Ever Happened To Baby Jane again. Wow! Now, it all feels slightly different, less campy more poignant. Joan Crawford as played by Jessica Lange - the best performance by an actress in many, many years - is a totally recognizable person, crazy or not. When George Cukor tries to convince Joan not to be so vindictive ""you're better than this Joan"" to what Crawford/Lange replies: ""No George, I'm not"" Fantastic! Like another user already mention, I agree What Ever Happened To Baby Jane and Feud will be feeding each other keeping each other alive for generations to come."
"I'm so engrossed in the Ryan Murphy's series ""Feud"" that watching again ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane"" was unavoidable. ""Feud"" works on so many levels and the performances are so spot on that I suspect What Ever Happened To Baby Jane will have another life and in this new reincarnation it will teach us something important about Hollywood, about acting, about fame and about the fragility of the human mind. All this in great part due to ""Feud"" Jessica Lange's performance as Joan Crawford is already, for me, in a pantheon of its own. There is not a moment in which the illusion falters and this is more true episode after episode. Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis is also superb but her character is the more educated, stronger. A Yankee. So she provokes a very different kind of emotion. To all fans of the actresses and of Baby Jane you can't afford to miss ""Feud"" and, please, give it a couple of episodes to adjust but once you get to the third episode ""Mommie Dearest"" you'll be hooked in the greatest possible way. Enjoy."
"I've always being a fan of What Ever Happened To Baby Jane. I saw it for the first time as a teenager and Bette and Joan became my obsession. I tried to see everything they had done and did I? All About Eve, The Little Foxes, Now Voyager as well as Mildred Pierce, Humoresque. I warmed up quicker to Bette. Her horrible women were priceless and she was fearless. Joan Crawford kept me at a distance, I think the cosmetics got in the way. But now, watching Baby Jane in 2017 - thanks to the amazing Ryan Murphy series ""Feud"" - I saw a very different Crawford and her performance has grown in scope and depth. I know I shall see this film again. Fascinating to realize there is still so much to discover."
"Not that this film isn't good, it's very good in a ghoulish sort of way. But the miracle is that it got made at all. Was director Robert Aldrich really a director here or more of a referee.In any event Aldrich in directing Whatever Happened To Baby Jane took a pair of screen legends whose well known and public loathing for each other and managed without being killed to fashion a film about a pair of has been performers who live in the same house with their memories, their problems and mutual hatreds.Bette Davis as Baby Jane Hudson was a child vaudeville performer who like so many child stars was a has been when she became a teen. Not to worry about income because when she became a teen, her younger sister Blanche played by Joan Crawford then became the family breadwinner. But that came to an end when she was crippled in a car crash and it was widely believed that her sister had deliberately used the car as a weapon of jealousy.So these two with everything and yet nothing in common are bound to the family house and each other. Crawford a prisoner in her wheelchair and Davis a prisoner of her own fantasies as she retreats gradually into her childhood and glory days.Crawford is seeing how Davis is becoming more and more unhinged and decides to sell the family estate and get Davis into the 1962 equivalent of Happydale. But Davis gets wind of the plan and she makes Crawford a prisoner in her own home and eventually Davis just loses it totally.The wrap up of shooting must have been a day celebrated by Robert Aldrich on each anniversary the rest of his life. But he got himself a film that's as fascinating as a bloody 20 car pile up on the Interstate. Whatever Happened To Baby Jane got an Oscar for costume design for a black and white film and four other nominations.One of those nominations was for Best Actress, a then record 10 of them for Bette Davis in the title role. Bette Davis was an actress who could make some mediocre films entertaining when she took the brakes off. Here the role called for the most outrageous kind of overacting and Bette made the most of it. Joan's more subdued role of the victim in this film, good as she was didn't have a chance next to Bette's for recognition. Of course Crawford legendarily took a perverse pleasure in being the honorary acceptor for Anne Bancroft when she won the Oscar for Best Actress for The Miracle Worker in 1962. Truth be told Anne was the Best Actress that year.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane is such a two woman film that the rest of the cast is just left in the dust. Another miracle occurred when Victor Buono received some recognition with a nomination for Best Supporting Actor as the mother fixated pianist who plays along with Bette Davis when she decides to revive her career. Of course the strange noises and doings in that house eventually creep him out. Buono's scenes are all with Davis and with the scene stealing Marjorie Bennett who's kind of a mirror image of Baby Jane Hudson as Buono's inebriated mother. Just holding his own with these two I'm figuring the Academy figured Buono deserved some recognition.Bette and Joan, both were destined to be trapped in mediocrity for the most part in roles well beneath their talents. Bette to her credit did escape with such things as an Agatha Christie mystery occasionally and The Whales Of August. But mostly she and Joan did horror flicks because of the impression that Whatever Happened To Baby Jane left on the minds of the movie-going public. Both also got unceremoniously dissed by their daughters in memoirs, Bette not having the decency to die before B.D. Hyman's book came out.Whatever Happened To Baby Jane as repulsively fascinating as it is is a testament to two screen legends and the stamina of director Robert Aldrich who got them to share the screen."
"It is well documented the Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, to put it mildly, didn't like each other very much. But to their credit, they saw the advantage of teaming up in a bizarre horror film that would revive their ebbing careers. That film was ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?""In 1917 Baby Jane Hudson is a big star in vaudeville with her father. Her sister Blanche is envious of her success and vows to be more famous some day. Fast forward to 1935 and Blanche has turned into Joan Crawford and Baby Jane, Bette Davis. Blanche has become a successful movie star while Jane's career has floundered.A tragic accident causes Blanche to become paralyzed and Jane to become her full time caregiver. The rivalry between the two carries on. Both are immersed in their past successes however, Jane has begun to lose it. She continually harasses Blanche to the point of serving up bizarre meals to force Blanche to stop eating. Blanche is prevented in calling for help by the ever increasingly paranoid Jane. Housemaid Elvira Stitt (Maidie Norman), sympathetic to Blanche becomes suspicious of Jane's actions.Jane meanwhile is dreaming of a comeback and hires Victor Flagg (Victor Buono) to accompany her and help manage her career. Blanche in the meantime has made it to the phone and calls for help but Jane walks in and catches her. Jane then ties Blanche up and imprisons her in her room. Elvira, sensing trouble forces Jane to open the door to reveal the pathetic Blanche bound up to her bed. This forces Jane to take action and.........................................Davis and Crawford had been rivals since their salad days in the 1930s, when both were major stars. Both were immensely talented but just couldn't get along. Now as both were well into their 50s, they were smart enough to see the value of teaming up for the first time in their long careers. Unfortunately this was the one and only time they did so. Plans to re-team them for ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte) (1964) fell through. Both finished their careers in TV and in ""crazy old broad"" type pictures. Davis' ""The Whales of August"" (1987) was an exception.Also in the rather large cast were Marjorie Bennett excellent as Buono's mother Dehlia, John Ford favorite Anna Lee as the next door neighbor Mrs. Bates and Davis' daughter B.D. Merrill as Liza Bates. Too bad she didn't inherit her mother's considerable talent.By God they still had it. Too bad that this was their only collaboration."
"In 1917 ""Baby Jane"" Hudson is an adored vaudevillian child star, while her sister Blanche Hudson lives in Jane's shadow. By 1935, both sisters are movie actors, but their fortunes have reversed: Blanche is a successful film actress, while Jane is forgotten and languishes in little-seen B-movies. One night, an inebriated Jane mocks Blanche at a party, provoking Blanche into running away in tears. That night, Blanche is paralyzed from the waist down in a mysterious car accident that is unofficially blamed on Jane, who is found three days later in a drunken stupor. In 1962 Jane has descended into alcoholism and mental illness, and treats Blanche with cruelty.What happens is a waking nightmare but the ending is more shocking than Bette Davis appearance. Now this film is fun to watch. You need to see this. This was an instant classic upon its release. In 2017 the film returned to public conscienceless because of the Ryan Murphy Mini Series ""Feud"". That mini series is all about ""Betty & Joan"". It details the making of this film and all the events that surrounded it."
"I have seen this movie at least two dozen times, and I will see it at least that many times again.  It's such a Bette Davis feast.  Of course, she was nominated for an Oscar.  And she should have won it!  There was a lot of 'history' between Miss Davis and Miss Crawford going way back to the 1940s, when Crawford was let go from M-G-M and went to work at WB where Bette Davis was Queen of the lot.  The stories behind the making of the film are as interesting as the movie, with Miss Crawford demanding the set be kept at a breezy 55 (but preservative) degrees causing all kinds of problems with Miss Davis's bronchitis.  One only wonders how much 'acting' was involved as Miss Davis tortures Miss Crawford emotionally and, later, physically.  Miss Crawford suffers grandly and has her mandatory telephone scene, big eyes tremulous with fear.  She is great, but it is a Bette Davis tour-de-force and she wipes every other actor off the screen.  Full 10 of 10 for this one, and recommended to everyone who wants to see what the great actresses of the 1930s and 1940s could and would still do, albeit in minor-A productions, as the requests for their services dwindled, but wanted to keep on working."
"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? might seem dated, but it is still an extremely riveting watch. I literally could not look away, as soon as the movie started, I couldn't stop until it had finished. Not a lot of movies can do that to me. The acting is extremely good, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are just so good as the main focus of the movie. The chilling score is suits the movie and the camera-work reminds me a lot of Hitchcock.The story focuses on two sisters, Blanche Hudson (Joan Crawford) who was crippled in an accident awhile ago and ""Baby"" Jane Hudson (Bette Davis). Jane used to be a big child star, she even had a doll brand after her. Now, though, she is no longer recognised while her sister has recently become very famous. They live in an old mansion, with Blanche confined to her room upstairs while Jane gets madder and more cruel by the day.Bette Davis gives the star performance here, some may call it over-acting but it is far from. She really makes Jane as mad, cruel and sad as possible. Joan Crawford is equally good in a very different role. She is much more timid then Jane and quite scared. The supporting cast are all good as well, especially Victor Buono as Victor Flagg, an odd pianist that befriends Jane. The black and white really are used to full effect, they make the mansion look extra creepy. Robert Aldrich's direction is fine.To today's modern audience, this may seem boring as it does not have any action. Most of the movie is dialogue, but I do urge those who haven't seen it to do so, as it is a truly excellent movie.A solid 5/5!"
"Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were the biggest rivals during the golden age of Hollywood.This is their only collaboration.In the beginning of the movie we're at 1917, where the six-year old Baby Jane Hudson (Davis) is a successful Vaudeville performer.Then we move to 1935 where her sister Blanche (Crawford) becomes paralyzed in an automobile accident for which Jane is held responsible.In the present-day of the film we see Blanche being kept as a prisoner upstairs of their mansion by the sadistic Jane.Robert Aldrich' What Ever Happened to Baby Jane (1962) is a terrific psychological thriller with some black comedy.The leading ladies are truly magnificent.Bette Davis was born a hundred years ago in 1908 and died in 1989.She could play all kind of roles and make the characters memorable.Baby Jane Hudson is that kind of a role.Joan Crawford lived from 1905 to 1977 and started making pictures during the silent era.Her Blanche Hudson is vulnerable and that's why we like her that much.A fine performance is given by Victor Buono who plays the shiftless musician Victor Flagg.Maidie Norman plays Elvira Stitt.Michael Fox, who the soap opera fans remember from The Bold and the Beautiful plays Motorcycle cop.This movie is a classic."
"Interesting, to see comments dismissing WEHTBJ? as a ""gay"" film, or ""cult"" film, etc.As a writer/producer who lived and worked in Hollywood for 30 years, I submit that those comments represent a ""denial syndrome"" of people who are ignorant of the facts of Hollywood.What is so ""horrifying"" about WEHTBJ? is that the film is an utterly realistic psychodrama about two specific sisters of that era.It's easy to say that Bette Davis' performance/makeup was ""over the top,"" except that they weren't. In fact, I thought her look was taken from a sad ""street person"" in Hollywood who, in her seventies, walked up and down Hollywood Boulevard in a pink ball-gown and dead blonde wig and thick makeup, speaking into a transistor radio she held to her ear -- in the 60s, long before cell phones -- ""talking"" to the FBI about people chasing her.Perhaps those who've spent their lives elsewhere, other than in Hollywood, feel that the characters in WEHTBJ? are ""over the top."" But they're not.That's what makes them so heartbreaking. And the incredibly brave performances by Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Victor Bono and the rest -- not to mention the script and Robert Aldrich's direction -- make this simply the most definitive ""Hollywood"" psycho-thriller since ""Sunset Boulevard.""There's ""A Star Is Born,"" in any of its incarnations. Which is also ""true"" in its (their) way.And there is ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Baby Jane,"" which are even more true, and more brilliantly made.These are not ""horror films."" They are riveting psychological studies, cast with astonishing actors, and magnificently directed and photographed.They are the equivalent of Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" IMHO, which was preceeded by ""Sunset Boulevard"" and followed by ""Baby Jane.""Each different, each brilliant, each marked by some of the most indelible performances ever captured on film.It's typical of adolescents to make a ""joke"" about things that make them uncomfortable.But when experience and age acquaint one with people like Baby Jane and Norma Desmond and, yes, Norman Bates, what's the point of joking?These three films will tell those characters' stories forever, and better than 99% of films ever made.That's why they're classics."
"The movie was suspenseful to the end and the musical score was awesome. I only disagreed with Henry Flagg's role, and he was such a wimp! It was great to see two '30- '50s Divas in one film, especially Joan Crawford's duplicitous role as a wronged sister. Bette Davis was truly deranged by the alcohol and the light switch personality changes was a joy to see. I especially loved the facial changes between the regression to the childlike Baby Jane and the hatred-driven character who was destined to take care of a sister more successful than her in adulthood. It may be a slow development of a story by today's standards, but the pace was good for me. I was intrigued to the end and suspected nothing like the final outcome."
"""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is a most unusual and impressive thriller. Director Robert Aldrich achieves a fantastic sordid and dark atmosphere at the Huadson sisters mansion -where most of the action takes place- with an unusual black and white shooting for the early 60's. An interesting story, a well delivered screenplay and an accurate musical score also rise the film high.But the main credit of the picture is casting together to real big names in Hollywood's history, not at their peak then but always reliable and attractive to see. Bette Davis (Jane) takes the most interesting character as the former child star that couldn't make it as an adult in show business so she has gone insane and keeps behaving as the spoiled child he was. She looks grotesque and ridiculous in her child outfits, hairdo and heavy make up. Davis is outstanding in her role and looks really mean when she tortures both mentally and physically her sister Blanche, delicate and reasonable. Joan Crawford plays Blanche and very well too, a former big star whose career ended after a strange car accident that put her on a wheel chair for life.In the end things are not completely as they seem but the final twist is not what makes this film an extremely good one; it's the strange relationship between the sisters, that requires of that final twist to understand Blanche's tolerant conduct towards her sister.The movie is perhaps a little too long and it would probably have been even better with a 10 minutes cut. But no doubt this is a top product in its genre and a great movie indeed."
"In 1917, Baby Jane is a famous, but spoiled child star that performs a show with her father under the jealous look of her sister Blanche. In 1935, Blanche Hudson (Joan Crawford) becomes a famous and glamorous actress in Hollywood and the untalented Baby Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) only acts because Blanche forces the producers to give parts to her. One night, they go to a party and there is a car accident.In 1962, Blanche is a crippled woman that has been left wheelchair-bound after the accident that lives with her alcoholic sister Baby Jane in a decaying Hollywood mansion. Baby Jane does not recall the accident since she was drunk and is in absolute control over Blanche that is completely isolated without any contact with the outside world and dumping her correspondence in the trash. As Baby Jane becomes more insane, she decides to return to the stage and hires the idle Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) to play piano. Meanwhile she continues to torment Blanche and her cruelty increases.""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is one of the greatest American movies ever, with top-notch performances of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. The disturbing story of sibling jealousy, rivalry, malevolence and insanity has a surprising plot point in the end that really surprises. I believe the three lead characters – Baby Jane, Blanche and Edwin Flagg – are a field day for psychologists. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Que Terá Acontecido com Baby Jane?"" (""What Might Have Happened to Baby Jane?"")"
"""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane"" is a tense horror film, yet it seems almost comical at the same time. The story is about Baby Jane Hudson, a former child Vaudeville star who has now grown older and been shyed away from the spotlight and attention that she so dearly loved. Baby Jane has a sister, Blanche, who is now crippled and restrained to a wheelchair. But before becoming immobile, Blanche was once a movie queen herself, and she incidentally pushed her sister out of the spotlight, which ignited extreme jealousy from Baby Jane. Now, Baby Jane spends most of her time in a crumbling Hollywood mansion, taking care of her sister. She plays mean and dirty tricks on her, even going as far as to preparing Blanche a dead rat on her lunch platter and brutally beating her when she tries to phone for help, keeping Blanche contained within the walls of their home. Baby Jane lives in a world of false hope, thinking that she may be able to reprise her childhood career, putting on makeup and keeping her curly hair intact. But Baby Jane's continued jealousy burns on as Blanche's popular films are re-run on television, and her violent, twisted, and abusive side begins to come forth.The entire film surrounds the two sisters as they fight back and forth, doing horrible things to each other. It's like a grown-up case of sibling rivalry between two of Hollywood's leading women, that turns out to be very well crafted and interesting to watch. Both Davis and Crawford, Hollywood legends, give top quality performances and bring depth and dimension to the characters of Baby Jane and Blanche. Granted, there is no shock value in this film anymore because it has become so dated, but it is still worth the while to watch because of how interesting it is to watch both actresses interact with one another. Davis plays the mad Jane with perfect mannerisms and eerie hysterical expressions as she torments her sister, costumed in ghostly white, caked makeup and golden curls in her hair.It is kind of ironic because it has been speculated that Davis and Crawford really despised each other behind camera, they were both major award winners with legendary status in cinema, practically rivals themselves, which could have played into the way they treated each other in the film... or maybe not? I'd say it was very likely though. To sum it up this review, ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane"" is a dated but exceptionally-crafted thriller. Modern day audiences will not be frightened, but the film itself was very, very well done. 9/10."
"I don't think I walked into this one with the right set of expectations. I expected a low-fi, creepy bit of occult-tinted fun from an age before horror films were bloated, over-done sacks of crap, and what I got was much different. I wouldn't really say this is a straight horror movie like Psycho or The Birds, as it unfolds itself like a riveting drama of two sisters instead. The acting is phenomenal, though, at least from our two lead characters, and the way they play off each other is just fantastic. This one takes a while to get going, but once it does, you are in for a high-octane, creepy thrill ride. Recommended to fans of older horror/suspense type movies."
"This 60s thriller ingeniously casts two faded Hollywood stars as ... two faded Hollywood stars. While Joan Crawford's Blanche is stuck in a wheelchair Bette Davis's Jane takes care of her. Bitter that her career as a child vaudeville star was eclipsed by Blanche's adult career, Davis drinks, looks through her old scrapbooks, and, unfortunately for Blanche, begins to lose her mind.Davis commits fully to her bizarre character, starting out as a slatternly drudge and slowly going over the edge. There is a bravery to Davis' role most notable in her extraordinary recreation of Jane's childhood act. Victor Buono is also excellent as a rather peculiar pianist.While I've never been a big Crawford fan, she is quite good as Blanche, whose genial indulgence of her sister slowly turns to terror.The movie is a classic of its kind and necessary viewing for fans of Davis and/or 60s thrillers."
"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is a crackling psychological thriller made in the post-PSYCHO world and a ghastly old Southern Gothic horror film to boot. It's notable for featuring two great actresses of yesteryear, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, knocking heads and sparks off each other as a pair of old-time actresses with the ultimate in love/hate relationships. As shot by Robert Aldrich, this film is very well made and one of a kind for its time; the psychological approach is second to none and the sheer level of demented hysteria that builds after a slow start is remarkable."
"One of the great movies about the movies, (and great movies about the movies aren't reverential, they bite the hand that feeds them), and the best of Aldrich's 'women's pictures'. Detractors see it as a misogynist load of horse manure about a couple of self-loathing sisters hauled up together in a decaying Hollywood mansion, a too-close-to-home study of the real life rivalry between stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford or even as a veiled study of homosexual self-depreciation with the sisters as ageing drag queens. But these are the very things that make the picture great. It is precisely because it can be read in this way that makes it such a perversely enjoyable, subversive piece of work.As the sisters, Davis and Crawford pull all the stops out and then some. What makes Crawford's performance great is that she is never sympathetic even when Davis is feeding her dead rat or quite literally kicking her when she's down, while Davis is simply astonishing. With her face painted like a hideous Kabuki mask and dressed up like a doll that's filled with maggots it's an unashamedly naked piece of acting, as revealing as her work in ""All About Eve"" and almost as good. Unfortunately the film's commercial success lead both actresses into a downward spiral of not dissimilar but considerably lack-lustre material. But this bitch-fest is the real McCoy."
"Is there a more surreal image in cinema than the sight of Bette Davis dragging Joan Crawford across the floor by her arm? And this, right after using Ms. Crawford for a soccer ball in a truly chilling scene. This movie is unlike so many classics you're likely to run across, not quite a horror film, but creepy enough to straddle that genre with a peculiar fit. I'm sorry now I waited so long to watch it.Davis and Crawford share about equal screen time, and it would be hard to score one's performance over the other. But without question, Davis is pure hag in this one, a bitch on wheels who takes glee in tormenting her sister due to the reversal in their career fortunes. The film will keep you off balance wondering why Blanche Hudson (Crawford) seems to continually make excuses for Baby Jane's (Davis) rude behavior, especially when as a child, she sets up the viewer for revenge with a remark she makes to their mother - ""You bet I won't forget"". It's not till the end of the story that Blanche makes her confession, but by then you've placed all your sympathies with her.As for creepy, you would think a dead bird in the lunch tray is tops in macabre, but only until Jane outdoes herself with a rat from the cellar. There's something about dead birds in film that arouses a primal, gut level response. It was used as a device in 1944's ""The Curse of the Cat People"" and more recently in the German film ""The White Ribbon"" (2009). Maybe it's just me, but the imagery is truly frightening and enough it seems, to send one's victim over the edge. It certainly did here.What drove this viewer over the edge though, was the adult Jane Hudson's version of 'I've Written a Letter to Daddy'! It was barely tolerable when the youthful Baby Jane sang it on stage, but Davis's performance was fingernails on chalkboard. That scene might just be worth waiting the entire picture for, notwithstanding the violent confrontation between Davis and Crawford near the finale.But the best is the twist ending that you never see coming as Blanche Hudson makes her dying confession on the beach. While the entire time the picture has you sucked in about what a hate filled woman Baby Jane has become, it's not until Blanche sets the record straight about the accident that ended her career. You have to wonder who was the more bitter woman, as Blanche tells Jane - ""You weren't ugly then. I made you that way""."
"By 1962, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford had been all but relics from Old Hollywood. Even then, they were faint memories of a time gone by. No one young and alive at that time knew who they were nor did they have an interest in their all but dead careers. New stars were on the rise, sensibilities were changing, movies were starting to rely less on star power and taking risks with lesser known actors who did not convey the typical Hollywood image. New directors were also the hot ticket, and had little time or patience to deal with the vitriolic antics of temperamental females who threw their ego around like they would do with a small object in the heat of an argument. It was the start of the end of the American innocence.And innocence lost is what seems to be the central theme of Robert Aldrich's Gothic horror movie WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? The story of two sisters living in complete isolation from the rest of the world, hating each other every from dusk 'til dawn, and harboring a deadly secret that could kill them is not the kind of material anyone would associate the two lead actresses with, but by then, their choices in scripts were precious few, both had begun to take baby steps in television -- considered by many actors to be a step down in their careers -- and both needed the work to pay the bills. When Crawford got her hands on the book, she decided to turn it into a movie because it would give her a chance to work with the actress she admired the most, even when such admiration was rebuffed with brutal aggression and had turned into hatred.Enlisting Robert Aldrich, who had directed her in AUTUMN LEAVES (and with whom Crawford had had an affair with), and securing Davis in the role of the more dominant sister, cinema history was made when for the first time audiences got to see both actresses essay not only their character counterparts, but relive their extreme, morbid antipathy against each other. Reports of tension on the set flew like wildfire: for the first time since Miriam Hopkins, Bette Davis was up against the only other female whom she did not particularly like. Crawford knew she would have to compete in many other ways -- salary and dressing room included -- to make her experience with the stronger-willed Davis bearable. But... Crawford must have known what she was getting into: when you express such admiration for someone who does not respond back, and force yourself into a project with that person, anything can happen.Despite the belief of a feud, both actresses expressed getting along quite well together. Of course, Davis added that had they worked for three months instead of three weeks, the result would have been much different. It is interesting, however, to see how they play against each other scene by scene: Davis overacts to almost impossible degrees and without knowing makes Crawford come off better. It was like seeing Mildred Rogers meeting Mildred Pierce for a perverse face-off: and it is also interesting to see that the wig Davis wears bears a resemblance to the way she wore her hair in OF HUMAN BONDAGE to some degree, the same way the resemblance to Crawford as Blanche to her anterior character is striking.As a movie, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is a lesser sister film to SUNSET BLVD., but also a precursor to Rob Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's MISERY with the genders reversed. It did pave the way for a sub-genre within the horror genre featuring older women in exaggerated Gothic stories of murder and mayhem, and on that alone it does deserve that accolade. It also became something of a distant relation to the works of David Lynch in its willingness to depict an inherent weirdness within the sadomasochistic, co-dependent relationship between the sisters. At times a little exploitative, at times gripping, and at times flat out funny, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? was yet another triumph in both Crawford's and Davis' careers with an Oscar nomination for Davis, an Oscar snub for Crawford, and increased tension between the two women. Both were slated to appear in a follow-up movie that became HUSH, HUSH... SWEET CHARLOTTE in 1964, but because of ""medical reasons"" Crawford had to bow out, leaving Davis' old friend Olivia deHaviland to step in. Neither actress would ever work together again. Crawford's career would come to an end not 8 years later in 1970 following a string of grade F horror movies (a shortened version of what has become Karen Black's career), whereas Davis would successfully alternate the remainder of the Sixties and all throughout the Seventies and Eighties between OK horror movies, TV dramas (where she would get Emmy nominations), and even a pilot for a series co-starring friend Anne Baxter. As it is, this remains a blueprint for actors who have been known to despise each other, working together, and making their mutual animosity the stuff of high camp and egotistical overacting."
"I am a huge lover of all films, especially classics and horror flicks. I had heard about this film for years and was really excited when I rented it, but was thoroughly unsatisfied by the product. Where do I begin...The setup is very compelling. I loved seeing Jane as a talentless brat and Blanche as the quiet older sister who grows up to become the hottest actress in Hollywood while Jane turns into a drunk laughingstock. Then when it looks like Jane cripples Blanche, I was horrified and my eyes were glued to the screen. It was all downhill from there.First of all, I have to take issue with Bette Davis's performance. I know that's sacrilege, but I couldn't stand her. I'm not sure how much of the blame should be divided among her, the screenplay and the director but her character was so over-the-top that it just became cartoonish at times. Some would of course argue that that's to the film's benefit, because they love the black comedy. I've heard that the film is a favorite of drag queens, and I can see why. But I think it severely undermines the film's merits as a HORROR movie, which is how it's almost always qualified. If they wanted to go the black comedy route, they should have gone farther with that b/c I thought as they did it things just didn't mix. Davis's caricature was such a glaring contrast to the sincere performance of Joan Crawford, as well as pretty much everything else in the movie.Speaking of Crawford, though, I found her character mind-boggling at times. So it was established that Blanche has been trapped by Jane for all the years since the accident. Why couldn't she just leave? Surely the top actress in Hollywood would be able to afford personal care! Some fans might say that's answered at the end of the movie, but I'll come back to that. When Jane was torturing her that much, why couldn't Blanche at least call the police and say she was being held against her will? It's mentioned during the movie that Jane's started going insane, so maybe it hasn't been going on that long, but if Blanche doesn't even get any visitors ever, she must sense something's wrong. And then when Blanche goes through the INCREDIBLE ordeal of getting to the phone downstairs when she's home alone after Jane's taken out her phone, why doesn't she use that to CALL THE POLICE! Some might say she was concerned about Jane and wanted to get a doctor for her, but I'm sorry, when a character's such a one-dimensional doormat, I stop caring about here. If the ending is supposed to justify all this, well I think whatever Blanche did was more than made up for by the endless abuse Jane subject her to, and I don't see how anyone could reasonably argue otherwise.When Elvira found Blanche, I was relieved thinking at least the movie was going somewhere now with Blanche about to be rescued. BUT WHY DID ELVIRA LEAVE THE HAMMER OUTSIDE WITH THAT PSYCHO RIGHT NEXT TO IT? Gee, who thought Jane would bash her head in? I was again happy when Edwin found Blanche, but he just ran off stammering! What the hell was the point of him even being in the movie? I'm thinking there just wasn't enough story to fill out a film otherwise. I thought he was just an annoying fat guy, and he turned out to be an annoying heartless fat guy. How did Victor Buono get an Oscar nomination for that? Why am I not surprised that people never saw or heard of Mr. Buono again after this movie? While the movie had glaring flaws, I thought it would at least be great to see Blanche saved and Jane killed at the end. But instead, one of the worst twists in history was thrown at us! The only things the film had in its favor at any point were a sympathetic heroine and a contemptible villain. So what do they do at the end? Make Blanche responsible for her own trouble and Jane a lovable loon! Even if Blanche paralyzed herself, Jane kept her a prisoner, starved her, beat her, and berated her endlessly. And let's not forget SHE MURDERED ELVIRA! I'm not buying the mental illness excuse the movie tries-Jane was a monster her whole life and apparently towards the end became a monster unable to handle how pitiful she was. The pathetic attempt at shocking viewers just made me wish I'd never met either sister! Oh, and by the way-Jane's giddy dancing at the end? A RIPOFF of the INFINITELY superior Sunset Boulevard!!!!!!!"
"I recently viewed this film with a friend who had never seen it before. Much to my surprise, we had to turn it off early because this friend actually found Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? boring.   
I'll admit that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is a dated piece of work. By today's standards, there is no shock value.  The actresses are not well known by the younger crowds out there.  There is a lot of dialogue and very little action. It simply doesn't fit in with today's expectations of horror and suspense.  So why does it hold up as a great film, at least by my standards and by the standards of so many others?To truly appreciate this film, it would be necessary to understand the background.  What actually contributed to the making of this film is what I find truly fascinating.  The story itself is about two elderly sisters.  One, Baby Jane, (played by Bette Davis) was a child star in the early part of the century.  She was hugely popular on the vaudeville circuit. Backstage she was a spoiled brat. Later on in life the other sister, Blanche (played by Joan Crawford) became a popular Hollywood movie star, overshadowing her now 'has-been' sister.  A supposed car accident leaves Blanche crippled during the height of her popularity and a crazed Jane is left to care for her.In their later life Blanche is confined to her bedroom and Jane, still donning the make up and curls from her childhood runs the house.  Jane still believes she can resurect her career, but is tormented by her sisters continued popularity as her films are rerun on television.There are some fabulous lines throughout the movie that have become legendary.  Blanche says, ""You couldn't do this to me if I wasn't in this wheel chair.'  Jane quips ""But ya are Blanche, but ya are.""Davis plays Jane to the hilt, looking hysterically eerie as she tortures Crawford's stoic Blanche.  My kid sister saw this film after seeing Mommie Dearest and aptly stated that this was just dessert for a woman who beat her children so badly.  I think my sister was most impressed when Davis kicks Joan in the stomach.  ""Take that Mommie Dearest!""Back to my original point, I believe that in order to truly appreciate this story, one must appreciate the behind-the-scenes legend that truly is the essence of this film.  Davis and Crawford were, and are, two of the most formidable actresses in Hollywood.  Between them there are hundreds of films, three Oscars, and countless tidbits of gossip.  Both had to claw and chew their way to the top, and had to fight harder to stay there.  They both had stormy relationships, and bitter feuds with studio bosses and directors. And both have a legion of fans that have survived long after they did.  And of course, lets not forget the fact that they may have despised each other. There is a fantastic book called Bette and Joan (I can't recall the author's name) that I recommend any novice viewer read prior to viewing this film. In it, the lives of these two remarkable women are described in gossipy detail.  A lot of time is spent detailing the making of this film. At the time Joan was pushing her husbands company, Pepsi.  It was rumored, perhaps by Bette that her Pepsi bottles were half filled with vodka.  Bette also complains vehemently about the size of Joan's fake cleavage, and how they got in the way of some of those scenes.  It's even suggested that some of those beatings that Joan took from Bette were real.  With all of this background, one might soon appreciate, as I did, the importance of this film in documenting the lives of these two prominent women.  I don't think we'll ever come so close to true Hollywood Babylon as we will with this brilliant work."
"The movie deals with two old retired actresses : Bette Davis and Joan Crawford , Davis is a nut-head and Joan Crawford is a cripple woman . A terrible secret originates taking on each other . The confrontation will be creepy and scary .From the beginning to the end the suspense and tension are continuous . The script of the film is very warped and the final has an extraordinary surprise . In the movie there is intrigue , mystery , violence , taut , terror and though being mostly developed on interior stages is neither tiring , nor dreary , but entertaining . The runtime is longtime , two hours and some approx. but it happens a lot of events and that's why isn't boring . Interpretation of the main actresses is first range , as Bette Davis specially , she with his make-up and hysterical acting is the real madness . Both actress will continue playing similar roles as ¨The anniversary¨ and ¨The nanny¨. Bette Davis was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in this movie . Had Davis won, it would have set a record number of wins for one actress . Davis and Joan Crawford had a lifelong mutual hatred, and a jealous Crawford actively campaigned against Davis winning Best Actress . The support cast with Victor Buono is outstanding . Robert Aldrich's direction is excellent , even the same realized a sequel : ¨ Hush,Hush sweet Charlotte ¨ ( with Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland and Victor Buono) . Black and White cinematography by Ernest Haller is rightly made and Frank DeVol music (Robert Aldrich's habitual musician) is stimulating .Rating : Above average . This is a definitely movie worth seeing."
"Finally after all these years watched this classic 1962 picture ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"", and I must say that it was a thrilling and chilling horror type spin take on rivalry and jealousy, showing the madness of a crazy mind! And the film works so well due to the fact of the performances of two legends Joan Crawford and Bette Davis who's chemistry rolls so well it's like you can feel the drama and hard feelings not just between the characters, but it's in real life the two seem to be at each other! The tale involves the story of Baby Jane(Bette Davis) a child vaudeville success act who's stubborn and selfish and later on as her star fades her older sister Blanche(Joan Crawford)becomes a better and well known actress. Only a tragic fate takes place Blanche is put in a wheelchair as a paraplegic did Jane do it? Now Jane has to care for Blanche at their old style Hollywood house, yet the treatment involves Blanche being locked upstairs in a room all day, and as Jane serves her meals on a tray they often have dead birds on the dish! The cruel and mean torments from Jane only continue as Blanche becomes a damsel in distress as she's tied up in bed and even has her mouth taped with duct tape so she can't talk! Now you talk about a sibling rivalry at it's worst! Jane is one crazy mind loss woman who's taken revenge and jealousy to new heights! Overall excellent film of madness, isolation, jealousy, rivalry and just overall crazy with suspense and a feel good horror film for 1962 a film that's a classic for it's rogue take and go against the grain way and the performance of legends Crawford and Davis help stamp the mark on this classic."
"I've FINALLY seen this movie; I've watched tons of ""best of movie lists"" thru the years and this is always on them!! I had brief knowledge of Crawford/Davis' real world relationship and it's awesome to see it play out on camera. This movie was much darker than I thought it would be, loved every bit of it. I won't give anything away but let me say the acting in this is spot on: Everyone played their characters wonderfully and the twists r rite on!! Considered a classic for good reasons!!!!!!"
"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is a psychological horror drama. This is a frightening view of the conflict between two different characters. It is based on the 1960 novel of the same name by Henry Farrell.The main protagonist is an adored yet ill-tempered vaudevillian child star, while her older sister lives in her shadow. 17 years later, the sisters have replaced their roles. The elder sister has became a successful film actress,while her younger sister has experienced failures. Hatred is born. One night, the elder sister has experienced a mysterious car accident. Her younger sister, who is found three days later in a drunken stupor, is blamed for that accident. Twenty years later, the sisters live together in a house, which was bought by the elder sister. She is in a wheelchair. Her younger sister has descended into alcoholism and mental illness...The two sisters living in the hell of jealousy, lies, hatred and monstrosity. The characters are completely different. One is frightened and helpless, while another character is restless and crazy. Each of them is faced with his own life crash in a grotesque way. The psychology plays in this story simply ""penetrate"" into the human mind. Mr. Aldrich has presented, in an ironic way, two idolized women and sisters who can not get rid of the past. The truth is buried very deep, while horror and lies crawl across the surface. A crime complements suspense and vice versa.Bette Davis (Jane Hudson) is simple phenomenal as a mentally disturbed sister. Character, who painfully goes through the past of her popularity and playfulness. However, she is a true maniac, who heals his wound in a cruel way. However, there is too much coincidence, therefore, the plots do not depend on the decisions of a crazy woman.Joan Crawford (Blanche Hudson) is an opposite and somewhat sympathetic character as a helpless woman. She is, in fact, an insidious and silent killer. It's hard to sympathize with her, after the truth, which she discloses at the end of the film.Victor Buono (Edwin Flagg) is a bit eccentric fat piano player. Frankly, I have expected some ironic reviews from him. However, he is lost in a comical ecstasy. Welcome to the hell, Mr. Flagg.Star Wars have a purpose and an epilogue."
"This is perhaps the best movie of Joan Crawford's and Bette Davis' career! Both actresses turn in the performances of a lifetime. I feel that it was such a shame that Joan's performance in this film was underrated by the Motion Picture Academy, and therefore NOT nominated for the coveted Academy Award. Bette's over-the-top performance WAS nominated, but Joan's subtle performance, which was much harder to accomplish, was overlooked. The redeeming factor in this award drama was the fact that Bette lost the award to Anne Bancroft, and Joan Crawford accepted it on her behalf! This horror classic is a MUST-SEE...so, IF you haven't seen...RUN..don't walk...to the nearest video store and rent it or purchase it...You won't be disappointed!"
"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)You can't look at this movie without some kind of wringing of hands, and looking the other way, and astonishment. It's brutal at times, and has the highest kind of verisimilitude. But it's also archly, intentionally exaggerated so that you can't say it's realistic, not in the normal sense.This bugs a lot of viewers, who either just laugh it off or turn it off. Understandably. This almost defines early 1960s camp, a more palatable version of Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) where the viewer is pushed outside the experience and made to watch it happen in front of you. Another parallel, with roots outside the mainstream, would be Sam Fuller's movies of the period, like The Naked Kiss (1964). (Notice the dates coincide--it became a recognizable style, and one different than television, which was winning the viewership wars, along with Vietnam on television. More recently, directors like Tarantino and Burton prefer this slightly artificial approach, as compared to Scorsese or Spielberg who are all about immersion and invisibility of the moviemaker's hand.) So this is Robert Aldrich, also behind the other quirky classics like the noir Kiss Me Deadly (1955) and Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964). Just getting Bette Davis and Joan Crawford together is enough reason to watch. Both are extremes, one of overstatement, the other of maddening understatement. The beginning is all set-up, the core of the movie a rising tide of campy horror, and the ending a stretch of logic after all we've been through, but a welcome one, since by this point, anything goes. The filming is absolutely gripping, with strong angles and daring closeups and lots of moving camera, so the limited sets are kept alive. And the acting beyond the two women, the maid (Maidie Norman) and the pianist (Victor Buono), is spectacular.Which takes us back to what also matters--the idea of sisters trying to make sense of a childhood rivalry that became horrific, and then poisonous for decades. It's a study in frustration, for sure, as you want to grab Joan Crawford's character and say, ""Just shout!"" and she won't."
"Baby Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) was a child star with a sister, Blanche (Joan Crawford) who felt left out. Later in life, however, the tables were turned, with Blanche as a big movie star and Jane as a has-been. Most of the film, however, is set when they're in their late 50s or early 60s. Neither is very famous any longer and Jane must take care of Blanche. The only problem is that Jane is slightly off her rocker.Whatever Happened to Baby Jane is the first of two Bette Davis films, with Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) being the other, which have a number of similarities. They are both psychological horror/thriller films, directed by Robert Aldrich, adapted from novels by Henry Farrell, with screenplays by Lukas Heller, both filmed in black & white in the early 1960s--a time when that began to be more of an artistic than a budgetary decision or necessity--and both very similar in tone, with Bette Davis as a ""crazy old bat"" in a big old house, interacting with a female rival, with major supporting characters as maids and men who are around as more submissive love interests, and so on. For many viewers this is the better film of the two, but for my money, I much preferred Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte. Even though my scores for the two films are close, the difference in quality for me was greater than my ratings would suggest, with Hush a 10 for much of its length--a slow, somewhat meandering middle section brought the final score down-while Baby Jane never really rose above a 7, instead occasionally threatening to end up with an even lower score.The main problem for me was that the slow meandering that was a flaw with the middle section of Hush is the norm in Baby Jane. I'm almost never someone who believes that a film should be shorter, but this is a rare case where a lot of liberal editing--say cutting the film by 45 minutes (the film is 134 minutes long)--could easily bring my score up to a 9. Of course, it also shouldn't be necessary to fix the film at that later stage, and we might just as well blame the looseness and pacing on the script. Some viewers might also find a problem with a few logical points in the script, but I think they're explainable if we were to spend time delving into psychological backgrounds and motivations of the characters. Whatever the cause, as it stands, although there are some horror and/or thriller aspects to the film, it is really recommendable only to viewers interested in realist drama material, and even then, only to viewers who like that genre slow and relatively uneventful. (Although another point of interest to horror fans is that it's easy to see a number of at least superficial similarities between Baby Jane and Stephen King's Misery, which was made into a film in 1990.)The performances are good. Davis is exquisite enough to make me almost wish that she had only played loonies and psychos throughout her career. Crawford has the difficult task of playing a complex, understated, physically challenging role. She goes through a number of subtle transformations, and somehow manages to look beautiful even when she's black & blue, bedridden and not wearing any make-up. Victor Buono, as composer/pianist Edwin Flagg, is able to convey a tragic underdog and provide comic relief at the same time, despite his relatively small amount of screen time. The performances are the crux of the film and the reason it receives as high of a score as it does. But they cannot carry the whole film. Despite a number of very good and occasionally horrific scenes, the biggest tragedy may be that film wasn't tightened up more. If you like Baby Jane at all, be sure you also check out Hush."
"A true story of a haunted house - with a living, breathing ghoul in residence! This is a great movie following a child star through her descent into alcoholism. Both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (Blanche) are exceptional in this movie and this is one movie you really don't want to miss! Note the re-creation of ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"" - truly chilling! The photography is exceptional and there are many fascinating scenes - Miss Davis has perhaps the most, eh, exotic makeup job ever seen in a movie and her every movement furthers her character. Victor Buono, in his first role, is a fascinating find, too - his lust for money vies with his morality and he wins by just a nose!"
"Maudlin acting. Manufactured coincidences. Even the premise was improbable: A woman agrees to live with the sister who maimed her? I don't buy it. The main thing the movie had going for it would have been the general plot line I was prepared to give the movie six or seven stars when I thought it might have been the first with that plot line. But it was at least 12 years too late. ""Sunset Boulevard"" had a similar plot line, and the differing details in ""Baby Jane"" weren't interesting enough or even plausible enough to justify another 195 minutes of film about aging Hollywood divas luring innocent dupes into twisted plans to regain fame."
"Utilising the deep-seated envy of its leading ladies to full measure, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane is an often disturbing, at times chilling & thoroughly captivating thriller and is one of the very first examples of hag horror."
"(Fave ""Baby Jane"" quote) - ""You mean all this time we could've been friends!??"" To be honest, I was all set to despise this ""Comedy-of-Horrors"", venomously, the very minute I sat down to watch it. But, that all changed within the first 15 minutes as I quickly became quite engrossed in the contrasting character portrayals given by its 2 lead, veteran actresses, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (both in their mid-50s at the time).I know that a lot of people rave approvingly about Davis's grotesque make-up and all of her ""scenery-chewing"" antics as being the highlight of this picture - But, personally, my vote for most outstanding performance goes to Crawford as Blanche Hudson, a prisoner trapped in her own tailor-made hell.I'd say that Crawford's riveting ""Please.... Help me!"" scene clearly put all of Davis's over-the-top shenanigans to absolute shame.Yes. This tragic tale about madness, pent-up resentment and living a life of long-faded dreams definitely has its fair share of glaring flaws - But, all the same, it certainly does hold up quite well, 53 years down the road.I definitely give film-maker, Robert Aldrich, a lot of credit for his competent direction of this picture. I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am that he didn't allow its storyline to ride right off the rails into utter mayhem."
"When I first saw a Few scenes of this film Back in 2005 in House Of Wax i thought that this is a Scary Movie, But in 2012 i finally saw it and it was something totally different, it was much more about illness and Psychology, it is a Sad Story.Bette Davis in her role was just brilliant in portraying Baby Jane she is still living in her childhood level back to 1917 and refused to grow up! And that's obvious by the style of her dressing her make up and her hair. although in sometimes she knowing and realizing the truth but she kept back to her small world. and at the end she become Crazy and 100% a baby child and you feel very sorry for her.For me this is the best role of Joan Crawford she is playing the innocent part ( but she isn't by the way ) in a very professional way make you feel sorry for her till the final scene.For me i just can't stop playing the phone scene and the final scene the were something like magic i can't forget Bette Davis reaction after knowing the truth and her final dancing scene she was marvelous.I still wonder how the ACADEMY didn't give Bette Davis The Oscar and how the didn't give Joan Crawford a nomination for This Role!!!a special thanks for the supporting cast: Maidie Norman,Anna Lee,Victor Buono and Julie Allred who played Baby Jane in 1917"
"provoked a considerably more intense reaction then it could possibly have for anybody seeing it for the first time now. Or any time in the last, say, forty years.This film was so successful that much of what was unique about it has been copied and reused in countless scary movies from that date forward.In 1962 I was a sophomore in high school when I saw this picture. It's difficult to convey how shocking it was. First of all, I was the first generation that grew up with movies of the 30s and 40s on TV. In fact, the script makes use of this when we see the neighbors and Joan's character watching herself on TV. So the audience knew perfectly well who Crawford and Davis were and the kind of movies they appeared in. This movie was so completely different from anything they had done before, it was a total surprise.The violence in the film was literally stunning. You couldn't believe what you were seeing when Jane assaulted her sister. It was horrifying. And the meals served--that's now a movie cliché, but at the time, it was completely unexpected; you couldn't believe they were showing this stuff on the screen. The suspense of what outrageous thing might come next was almost unbearable. It was totally thrilling.I think the film holds up pretty well, and of course, it's a must-see for anyone who wants to claim cultural literacy. But the truth is, the success of this movie has somewhat blunted the true horror us old-timers experienced back in 1962.But don't let that stop you. You're still going to get a few jolts...."
"""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane"" is, on the surface, a horror movie about two elderly actress sisters who live together and terrorize one another... but there is much more going on here.First, the movie is an excellent psychological horror picture that has stood the test of time. Brilliantly shot and directed it uses sometimes-subtle, sometimes-outrageous gags (and you will gag) to scare you and keep you on-edge. We as an audience relate to the Joan Crawford character- paralyzed, helpless, at the mercy of psychotic Bette Davis- which turns us into victims and amplifies the terror. Bette herself turns in one of her boldest performances and in spite of the fact that she's got curls instead of fangs she is surely playing one of the scariest monsters in cinema history.Much has been made of the camp value in a movie that features two legendary actresses being so openly ugly in front of the camera and becoming parodies of themselves. That's the second layer to the movie... art-imitating-life. Crawford & Davis were two of the strongest, most vocal Hollywood actresses of the Golden Age, and so of course many considered them female dogs. That aspect of their lives and careers is embraced- if not exploited- in ""Baby Jane"" as we get a look at what strong, angry actresses can do when the roles are hard to find.And so we move to the third layer of the movie... it was unprecedented when Bette Davis campaigned in the 1940's to break free of her contract to Warner Brothers... She wanted the freedom to work at different studios on different films, films she could choose for herself. When she won the landmark case it cast the first blow against the Hollywood studio system. The studio system was simple: actors were owned by studios like property and churned out three, four, five movies a year with little control over the choice and content of their pictures. It sounds a lot worse than it was, because it kept actors, writers, techs, etc regularly employed, and the average quality of a movie was high. Without the system actors were as they are today: free-lance, forced to pick their own projects and take an active role in getting movies made, packaging deals, etc. The new Hollywood also meant a studio could give any female role to whatever young, pretty starlet had arrived in town that morning... there were no financial obligations holding them to the Crawfords and Davis' anymore. Ironic? Maybe a little bit.And so Blanche and Jane fight in a claustrophobic old house- broken-down, deserted, abandoned. They fight because the world has forgotten them and the way they used to perform. They fight because they're jealous and bitter and because they refuse to accept that their time has passed. They're at odds with the world around them and the death of their careers and so they turn psychotic. In turn we get a movie that plays like a good nightmare... campy, shocking, funny, black, dramatic, suspenseful and sometimes silly. ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" is just as vital a movie today as when it was made... a dark masterpiece. Don't pass up a chance to see it for yourself.GRADE: A-"
"The pairing of these two great stars (who were, famously, not the best of friends in real life) set off a whole fad during the sixties: Gothic melodramas featuring older female stars from filmdom's golden age (the thirties and forties). While this trend lasted, a few stars saw their careers revived. However the reputations weren't necessarily enhanced. Baby Jane was the first, and the best of this strange genre. The film is beautifully photographed, well acted, the the script, though containing a few potholes, keeps the viewer's attention. Especially notable for a great debut comic performance by Victor Buono as a creepy sycophantic ""musician"" with a phony British accent. Subsequent outings by both Crawford and Davis, (who never worked together again)were not nearly as successful as this one. Joan, especially, was amazingly controlled as sister Blanche Hudson. No retelling of the plot is necessary here, but I do think the director, Robert Aldrich had a little fun with these two dragon-ladies of film."
"S P O I L E R SThere could be no worse way to envision hell than to actually sit through this overrated, joyless, tedious film. You could age as badly as Bette Davis while waiting for two or three classic campy line readings. Joan Crawford as a spineless pushover is absurd. The arrangement of a Gothic horror house immediately adjacent to a perky, dumb suburban 60s family (with a car port) is just one of the movies off-genre puzzles. Just where one might reasonably expect some denouement, a completely unwelcome sub-plot involving Victor Buono appears, lingers, and doubles the already unbearable running time. This movie is a feat of endurance. Watching it actually is no better than hearing a drag queen repeat it's over-exposed lines for an easy laugh. The bizarre anti-climax in which the two biddies end up on the beach, and Joan dies (apparently of chattiness) is a head-scratcher.The strange, uneven sequel Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte is the better of the two as entertainment."
"""Subtle""? No way. ""Well-crafted""? Not exactly. ""Sleazy and captivating""? YEP, you betcha!This is definitely a ""guilty pleasure"" movie. You know, one that you love to watch but is certainly not sophisticated or subtle. Though a psychological drama, the movie is loud, loud, loud to the extreme--and therein lies most of its cult charm. At her most dramatic and bellicose is Bette Davis--who plays a totally insane and vindictive wench. And, believe it or not, Joan Crawford UNDERPLAYS her part! I know to lovers of classic cinema this seems impossible, as Ms. Crawford might just be one of the biggest over-emoters in the history of film! No, this film is really Bette Davis' film from start to finish--Crawford is just there as an object to be tortured and tormented by our anti-hero, Bette (""Baby Jane""). According to one biography I read about Ms. Davis, she really DID torture Ms. Crawford--walloping the crap out of her on several occasions during filming and then claiming it was all an accident!! So, if you are the type person that loves Shakespeare, Jeeves and Wooster or documentaries about the plight of the Eskimos, then this film probably isn't for you. If instead, you like over-the-top, silly and somewhat scandalous films about insane people doing really nasty things, then have I got a film for YOU! PS--While I enjoyed this film, similar films from the era that I actually enjoyed more are Davis' follow-up HUSH, HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE and Crawford's STRAIT-JACKET. HUSH, HUSH was more intelligently written and subtle and STRAIT-JACKET was much more over-the-top and campy."
"Powerful story of envy, bitterness, malice and torment.Two aging sisters, Blanche and Jane, share a large house. Jane was once a child star and Blanche was, in adult life, a star of the silver screen. Blanche's career ended when she was left paralysed from the waist down in an accident involving Jane. Now Jane looks after Blanche in the house, though not very well. Filled with bitterness at her own cinematic career never taking off, envious of Blanche's career and money, an alcoholic and a touch deranged, Jane goes out of her way to torment her sister...A very well made thriller. Starts off slowly and is more a relationship drama for a while. Over time, however, director Robert Aldrich ramps up the intrigue, tension and malice. It is soon apparent that this isn't going to be resolved simply by dialogue...Quite Hitchcockian at times in the tension and intrigue...and menacing undercurrent.Great twist towards the end and a powerful conclusion.Bette Davis is superb as Jane, providing just the right level of menace and insanity. The result is one of the scarier characters in cinematic history. Davis got her 11th, and last, Oscar nomination for her performance. Quite astounding that she didn't win.Joan Crawford is solid as Blanche, and is the perfect foil for Davis/Jane. Victor Buono puts in a good performance as Edwin and provides the movies best comedic moments. He got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts."
"I think Whatever Happened To Baby Jane is supposed to be some ""cinematic masterpiece,"" so it's probably ""too good"" to be considered a camp-classic, but it certainly had the feel. I'm not insulting it though. I heatily enjoyed this dark tale of a bratty former child star who grows up a has-been while her sister, who was ""plain"" as a child became a star later in life...until she mysteriously got paralyzed. The twisted relationship between Crazy Jane and the more sane Blanche is fun to watch as it develops, but nothing is quite as entertaining as when the flashback when Jane was still nauseatingly refered to as ""Baby Jane"" and is throwing a tantrum right in the middle of her adoring public, who of course act all horrified. Great stereotype of child stars. Great fun."
"I was so excited when I found out that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford made a movie together. I ended up getting it at the library, not expecting anything all that great. I was extremely wrong! This movie is fabulous. Bette Davis plays Baby Jane Hudson a child vaudeville star. During her childhood, her sister Blanche is ignored and pushed aside while Jane gets all the glory. When they get older Blanche gets a movie contract, but in her contract it says that for every movie that Blanche makes, her sister Jane must make a movie as well. Blanche become a big star and a great actress. Jane on the other hand, does not. One night there is a car accident and Blanche becomes paralyzed and is in a wheel chair. The movie then moves forward to when Jane & Blanche are in their mid to late 50's. Jane has become a little crazy, and an alcoholic and does awful things to scare her sister who she keeps upstairs in her room all the time. I don't want to say much more and give away the movie, so ill stop there. The acting in this movie is really marvelous. Bette received an Oscar nomination, but I think Joan should have gotten a nomination as well. This movie shows no blood, or guts, like so many modern movies. It relies of the talent of its actors to convey the sheer horror and panic that Blanche is going through, and the personal demons that are affecting Jane. This movie is a true classic."
"One comment on the IMDB characterizes this movie as a ""gay icon,"" and many others call it ""campy."" Since some people don't seem to understand this drift of thought, I'll try to give my two-cents worth of interpretation. There is a certain kind of gay male sensibility that loves the kind of over the top humor that predominates in ""Baby Jane."" I never thought of this movie as a horror movie, though it could fit the genre. But, really now, horror depends on a certain level of credible realism, as in ""Psycho"" and all of Hitchcock's films. That's why it is scary. Even modern horror films with monsters, UFOs, etc, rest on the premise that these are real phenomena and the movies ask us to suspend our disbelief within the context of the movie.""Baby Jane"" is completely different, and that is why it is campy and humorous. Elegantly serving your invalid sister a rat for dinner is just too much! Over the top. Unbelievable. Outrageous. Histrionic. Bette's makeup, ditto. Joan's completely loving and devoted manner, ditto. In other words, in spite of its literal horror aspects, ""Baby Jane""--in its details--is too ridiculous to believe. Only a demented sicko (Bette's character) could possibly come up with these ideas, and only an equally demented and deluded sister (Jane's role) could find Bette in any way lovable or redeemable. Both roles are such exaggerations, such extremes, that they are funny, hilarious in fact. Even the sadistic treatment by Bette of longsuffering Joan is absurdly out of kilter. One can only laugh at the histrionics.Of course, so much of the camp aspect of the movie depends on our previous knowledge of both these famous actresses. Especially important, is the long history of venomous lines uttered by Hollywood's most superbly bitchy star, Mme Davis. ""All About Eve,"" of course, is the locus classicus for Bette's campy, dishy humor. It is another gay classic, one described elsewhere on the IMDB as ""every drag queen's favorite movie.""""Baby Jane"" is definitely a 10 out of 10."
"I wanted to watch this movie because I was looking for an exciting psychological thriller and I like to go back to the older movies as they often proved to be excellent in this particular genre. Baby Jane felt like it will be exactly what I was looking for. However, I was deeply disappointed.First off, I love Bette Davis (Jane) and Joan Crawford (Blanche). Nonetheless, their characters really got on my nerves because they were so over the top, both of them. Bette with the excessive ""crazy person"" look and Joan with the excessively polite person behavior. The movie wasn't thrilling at all - it's more of a drama than anything else. I don't think there was one moment that held me on the edge of my seat, except maybe the one where Blanche is trying to get to the phone downstairs. At the same time, though, I was irritated by it. Every time Jane would go out to run errands she would be away for a long period of time, giving Blanche enough time to seek help in many ways. Yet all she did in that time was one or two activities like eating candy or trying to get down the stairs. What, this took her hours? I know she was in a wheelchair but come on! If you're afraid for your life you'll frickin' drag your body down the stairs if you have to. And you'll do that as soon as your abuser left the house, too.Another thing that really irritated me was Blanche's complete incompetence. What, she couldn't scream out the window when she saw the neighbor? She couldn't throw things out to get somebodies attention? It's not like they were living in the woods, away from all forms of civilization. Imagine you're being held captive in your own house and you manage to get to the phone AND call for assistance. Would yo beat around the bush or scream ""come help me right now, my sister is crazy! Come NOW!!!""? For me, the whole movie is totally unbelievable. I don't blame the actresses but the director, producers and scriptwriters. The movie's full of plot holes and poorly executed storyline. That's why I give it a 6/10 rating."
"Two sisters grow up together in early Hollywood. One is Baby Jane (Bette Davis), a spoiled little blond who has a successful act, is the darling of audiences, and is loved by her father. The little tyke's signature song: ""I've Written A Letter To Daddy."" The other sister is dark and jealous Blanche (Joan Crawford), disdained by her father. Both develop movie careers as young ladies but Crawford's eclipses Davis's. The bitter competitiveness persists.Then one night the two sisters arrive home. We don't see the faces but it's clear that one of the sisters watches the other get out of the car and begin to open the gate to their splendid home. (Splendid by Hollywood standards of the time, meaning it looks like the inside of the Bronx Botanical Gardens.) The driver releases the emergency brake and guns the car into the gate, apparently smashing the other one up.Cut to the present, thirty or forty years later. Both are long forgotten. Crawford is paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair and bed on the upper floor. Davis, her caretaker, is still dressed and made up like a child star and she looks positively ghoulish. She ""takes care"" of Crawford alright. She insults her at every turn, serves her rats and dead birds on her dinner tray, rips out her phone -- and it gets worse. She's determined to keep Crawford a secret prisoner and torment her and the abuse turns physical.As always in these movies, there are one or two peripheral characters who visit the mansion from time to time and may find out about Crawford's increasingly desperate state. One is a sympathetic maid. Another is the flabby and imposing Victor Buono as a manipulative piano player pretending to help Davis get her career revived. As usual, they fail to rescue Crawford, after a great deal of cross-cutting between Davis returning to the house and the intruder creeping around and peering into nooks and crannies. Compare these scenes with Vera Miles investigating the old house in ""Psycho.""It must have had a lot of popular appeal because it generated a couple of imitations with names like ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" But what it is, fundamentally, is a kind of feminine version of torture porn. If a human being could be insulted to death, Crawford would have died long ago. I prefer this kind of torture to the masculine kind because it's less violent, though it's no less unpleasant.That brings up the question: Who the hell would want to watch stuff like this? It's not particularly well done for its type, though it was one of the first. ""Misery"" was more gripping if you were willing to subject your aesthetic apparatus to a posologically unsound dose of Novocain. And ""The Collector"" by comparison seems profound. But this? The initial shock of seeing Bette Davis made up like a kid at Halloween aside, it's all deeply depressing. It's full of clichés. After a monumental effort, Crawford manages to reach a downstairs phone and she doesn't call the cops. She calls the busy family doctor. And when she tries to explain that her sister is about to kill her, she turns to jelly and begins speaking vaguely and says things like, ""I can't explain it right now."" ""My life is at stake"" consists of five syllables and she can't organize them. Even the Big Reveal from the dying Crawford at the climax -- it was Crawford driving the car and she missed Davis and smashed her own spine when she hit the gate -- is, as far as I can tell, utterly pointless. What was keeping her from telling Davis the truth after the accident? Why did it take Crawford thirty years to finish doing her penance? Of the principal actors, Bette Davis must be said to have the most guts. Boy, does she look awful. Not many actresses would put up with that kind of make up and that kind of part. And it wasn't the only time. She looked plain awful in ""The Virgin Queen"" (1955). That's sacrificing ego for art.Certainly Crawford would never have done it. She had a personality of chrome steel, though a complete professional, and had two modes of expression on the screen: (1) suffering (eg., ""Mildred Pierce"") and (2) dominating (eg., ""Johnny Guitar""). That was it. As for her acting, F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote: ""you can never give her such a stage direction as 'telling a lie,' because if you did, she would practically give a representation of Benedict Arnold selling West Point to the British...."" Maidie Norman is effective as the maid who is too inquisitive. Anna Lee is as charming as ever as the friendly next-door neighbor. The award for best performance goes to -- wait, let me open the envelope -- Victor Buono as Laird Cregar, the sly, effeminate, exploitative, effete pianist with the face of a Turkish pederast who hates his domineering mother. That harsh and unlikable mother might be the most original touch in the film."
"For fans of cinema, atleast American cinema of the 30's, 40's, and 50's, ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" will not disappoint. Whatever the intentions of the filmmakers, whether they were attempting to create a dark comedy, a horror film, or just a thriller with those elements, the film is an intense ride. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, well-known in that era as opinionated actresses (often read bitchy) are here in top form. Bette Davis gives her best sister-from-hell performance as she hides behind coats of crusty make-up that adds to a rather dead look. Joan Crawford plays well the startled and shaken victim of Davis' character's twisted imagination. This is one weird and disturbing film (especially for its time) and almost a precursor to ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the Crawford-like ""Mommie Dearest"". Its thundering musical score keeps the heart-pumping and the material keeps the viewer well on the edge. It's no surprise this one is a cult classic!"
"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane was a movie I once saw about 7 years ago, and in all honesty some of it traumatised me not just the purposefully grotesque make up but also the snarl-and-shriek chemistry between the two leads. Watching it again, the film maintains its chilling and shocking values, but there is also under the surface a sadness, compassion and campiness(in a good way) that I didn't notice as much previously.What Ever Happened to Baby Jane is essentially a must see movie. The production values are superb, with beautiful yet atmospheric cinematography, well-tailored costumes, well-constructed/chosen sets/scenery and above all the grotesque yet brilliant make-up. The music never detracts from the atmosphere which is resolutely chilling albeit with moments of pathos as seen Davis' and Crawford's envy, the script shocks, amuses and delights and the story is well-paced and never less than interesting. Aldrich directs superbly, and while Victor Bueno is wonderful, it is the performances and hair-raising chemistry between the two leads that takes centre stage. Joan Crawford is superb, but Bette Davis has the meatier role as a very over-the-edge character and gives a portrayal that is both terrifying and heartbreaking.Overall, a must see film especially for the leads. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"it seems every time i view this film, some hidden nuance in the demeanor of joan crawford's blanche reveals itself to me and convinces me that it is indeed miss crawford's performance which makes this film so memorable, apart from the sheer box office genius of pairing two such high profile cinema legends under one roof. one of my two favorite moments (among many memorable ones) involves the scene where blanche enters jane's bedroom to suddenly discover, after searching jane's dresser, proof of jane's check forgery as well as a surreal glossy of the real 30s joan with the face all scratched out by a jealous jane. by the way, how fabulously surreal to encounter all the hidden references to joan's mgm heyday in this movie, especially the scene where joan watches herself on tv as 'sadie mckee.' however, the actual 'revelation' of subdued acting comes when blanche finds a box of chocolates in the same drawer and then proceeds to devour some of it with marvelously ravenous relish. it is one of the most fantastically well acted and realistic portrayals of utter physical hunger i have ever seen. the expressions on her face are pricelessly conveyed by the master of facial expressiveness. one almost feels compelled to applaud. this is just one of those moments in this movie when you realize joan's performance steals the show right from under bette's nose. the other tour de force scene comes when blanche later attempts ever so precariously to make her way downstairs to get to the phone by supporting herself on the stair rail, her hair all disheveled and her face portraying consummate anxiety and despair.it appears that, while bette relies much too heavily on 'make-up and mannerisms' to do the acting for her, joan has only her very own beautifully expressive face to convey every subtle emotion in the book. that's the real difference in my opinion. bette used her ghoulish make-up as a 'prop' while joan literally had to 'act' out what was, in reality, a much more demanding role as blanche. there are also certain scenes where bette's timing seems to be oddly off for some inexplicable reason, as in the scenes where she's required to let out those hyena-like bursts of demented laughter. don't get me wrong, i do appreciate bette's jane on occasion but, as a whole, i enjoy it much more on a campy (i.e., overly mannered) level. i feel the way this movie has been perceived is all wrong. i'm inclined to believe that, while joan was in fact supposed to play a sort of 'straight man' to bette's outlandish antics in this film, joan manages, in fact, to turn the tables and make herself the real 'acting' focus in this duo, rendering bette's jane a mere 'counterpuncher' at times. part of the blame for this unexpected turn of events, of course, is due to what must've been bette's overwhelmingly insecure desire to upstage, upstage, upstage!!! at all cost and make herself a much too obvious 'look at me' target throughout this film.also, joan's wonderfully conveyed despair and horror in her swirling wheelchair after the infamous 'rat' had been served to her, brings to mind shades of a louise howell, a tragically mentally troubled crawford role from the 1947 noir classic 'possessed' which earned her a second oscar nomination.at any rate, as in 'grand hotel,' where joan steals the show from garbo, so too in 'baby jane' she steals it from davis. i guess there is always a hidden and easily incurred danger in turning an 'overt' character like that of jane's into a one dimensional, cartoon-like 'monster' of camp, which is, sadly, all we get from bette. joan, however, knew better. she knew that it was blanche's role which actually offered the most 'acting' potential and she exploited it most effectively. in retrospect, it appears much too much has been made of bette's real chances to win the oscar for her turn as 'baby jane.' after repeated viewings, one realizes that bette's highly 'campy and shock value' portrayal deserved nothing more than a nomination, and that is perhaps being too generous, in all honesty. joan's subtle turn as blanche, on the other hand, would've been the perfectly nuanced role to celebrate with 'at least' a nomination. after all, it only seems fitting to have nominated both ladies if any was to be nominated at all. to have only nominated bette for her campy orgy of overacting as jane was in itself a horrendous affront to joan's real talent and career."
"I saw this movie after I saw ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte""(which caused me emotional and psychological trauma at the age of 7). I was 13 when I saw this movie, and again I was blown away. They just don't make movies like this any more!I have seen this movie numerous times and have it in my movie collection. I would say that this is one of my favorite movies. I became a fan of Bette Davis when I saw Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte (Since then I have seen her other performances)and I believe she was one of the finest performers of all time. Now,add Joan Crawford and you have got yourself a knock-out production. The whole plot is so deep and well portrayed by Bette and Joan. Whats adds to the realism is the fact that in real life these two ""Grand Dames of Cinema"" detested each other, making the interaction between the two in this film incredibly real. Again, as in Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"", you are right there until the very end without knowing the whole story. Every character in this movie was portrayed magnificently, from Mrs. Bates and her daughter Liza next door, the maid Elvira,and Victor Buono and his mother. Bette takes the cake, of course, again she truly IS Baby Jane Hudson with her ghoulish make-up to her sadistic treatment of her sister. Poor Joan, I would imagine it couldn't have been easy working opposite Bette! This movie is a masterpiece, and can be seen time and time again. It holds it's own and is definitely worth adding to your movie library!"
"This warped Gothic shocker is the ultimate Bette Davis movie. She is absolutely brilliant is the demented, sadistic, unpredictable Baby Jane, going so far over the top that she seems truly insane. Just look at her--a grotesque caricature of a Shirley Temple-style child star, complete with blonde ringlets and clownlike white powder caked onto her haggard face, trying to add a coy little-girl inflection to her cracked, boozy voice. Remember how Norman Bates was scary because he seemed so ""normal"" on the outside? The exact opposite is why Jane is so frightening. She is obviously, entirely sick and capable of anything. The scene of her croaking ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"" in a darkened room is one of the most haunting, chilling moments in motion picture history.Also great is Joan Crawford as tortured sister Blanche. She really makes us care about the character, so much so that we can forget what a monster Joan was in reality. The ladies are perfectly accompanied by Victor Buono, Oscar-nominated in his best role. The black-and-white cinematography is flawless and provides the perfect atmosphere, and the imagery is unforgettable. The entire film is deeply disturbing and gloriously capped by the bizarre finale. An essential for cult aficionados, with Bette giving the best performance of her long, illustrious career."
