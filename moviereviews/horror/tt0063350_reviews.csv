"Romero is sublime. His ability to take a small budget and turn it into a stratosphericly giant film is unparalleled. This is one of the best apocalypse films ever (along with the rest of the trilogy). The zombies represent a slow moving enemy. It is easy to escape them. You have only to fear your own mistakes. On these the zombies will capitalize. One of the best aspects of this film is the lead character. Romero has always presented intelligent non-stereotypical black characters in his films. This film was made in 1968 while civil rights tensions were high, and the most ""in control"" character in the whole movie is a black man. If you can get past a couple of cheesy supporting performances, this is one of the best horror films ever."
"This landmark 1968 horror-shocker is a great example of what can be done with a limited budget, a simple idea, and some dedicated and talented participants. Very nicely shot, mostly well acted, NOTLD grabs your attention from the very beginning to the very end - and what a classic end it is.The story begins with Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother visiting the grave of a friend of their mother, and takes off almost immediately, as they are attacked by a horde of cannibalistic zombies. Narrowly escaping, but losing her emotional balance in the process, Barbara escapes to a house a bit farther down the road where she meets Ben (Duane Jones), the hero of the film. They discover a family with a sick little girl and a young couple in the basement of the house and they all get to work barricading themselves in and preparing weapons and other defenses. The rest of the story concerns the group dynamics between these survivors as the dead close in on their refuge, the story of what is going on in the rest of the USA - revealed through TV reportage and radio broadcasts, and sheer survival. The human side of this film is an interesting and accurate character study concerning what happens to people whose very lives are threatened.The horror of this film is, unlike a lot of its recent descendants, less a matter of blood and gore than a matter of the real active horror of realistically depicted scenes of murder, death and cannibalism. Though the black and white footage involving blood and gore is certainly effective, there may not be quite enough of it for today's average horror fan. The photographic techniques of this film are innovative and powerful - showing just enough of the sheer hideousness of the film's basic concepts to disturb viewers, but not enough to allow them to detach from the film's protagonists.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in the art of film making, and to those who enjoy the horror genre, though it is hard to imagine any serious horror fan who hasn't already seen this."
"I don't think George Romaro ever had in his mind the masterpiece he created when he made Night of the Living Dead, one of the greatest horror movies of all time and gave birth to the zombie genre. The monster that is the zombie has been a little experimented with before with the film ""White Zombie"" but never like the dark depths that George took it too. To think that this film almost never would have made it to the public since George threw it in the trunk of his car thinking nobody would ever buy it, low and behold not only did the film sell but has one of greatest group of fans to follow it. Such a degrading film for it's time with naked, scarred up, chewed up zombies eating human flesh, there was no film like Night of the Living Dead. The metaphor that we are guaranteed 2 things in life: birth and death, the slow inevitable death that is walking towards you as if you are looking at your future self is just horrific. George was way ahead of his time and that's why Night of the Living Dead still gives me nightmares to this day.Barbra and Johnny drive to rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave. When Barbra is afraid Johnny teasingly frightens; whereupon they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny tries to rescue his sister, but is then presumably killed when the man shoves him head first onto a tombstone. Barbra flees, with the killer in pursuit; eventually she ran off to an empty farmhouse where she discovers the half-eaten corpse. Running out of the house, she notices a man named Ben arrives in a pickup truck, drags Barbra back into the house, and barricades the doors and windows. Meanwhile, hiding in the cellar are a married couple, Harry and Helen Cooper, their daughter Karen, and teenage couple Tom and Judy. Harry asks everyone to hide in the cellar, but Ben deems it a ""deathtrap"" and remains upstairs. As they fight through the night for their lives, they try to escape to a safe house but the zombies outside have pulled up the table with the salt and pepper and are a bit hungry for some human flesh.George casted a black lead, which was so unheard of at the time, I'm sure he never looked at the color but what a groundbreaking moment. He's the smart man who knows how to fight and even hit a white woman, what risks George took with this movie. The film is by no means perfectly made, but you have to understand that this was a low budget film made by a group of friends, however, when you think compared to today's low budget films that have no story with it, it's all about the gore, Night of the Living Dead broke that mold. I have a little tradition every year on Halloween, I have to watch this movie because it is one of the best horror movies of all time. How could you not still get the chills when little Karen turns into a zombie and goes after her mother with a shovel, her mother screaming ""Baby!"" and falls crying and screaming as her daughter just continues stabbing her to death, God, what a horrific scene! Taking a chance with a depressing ending, not to spoil too much as I feel that I already have but I envy anyone who sees this film for the first time because I like to see their reactions to this movie. A groundbreaking film, a horrifying story and a cast and crew that gave all effort, Night of the Living Dead is a terrific scary movie not to be missed.9/10"
"Night of the Living Dead is a true classic and without a doubt Romero's best and most influential film.Of course, being simply influential alone would not simply allow this movie to get a full-fledged star rating if it didn't pull through with it some quality at all, which it does in spades. In Night of the Living Dead, there is good pacing, surprisingly good acting from a list of no-name actors, and the most important part that sticks with the film to this day, the sense of dread in the film. In this movie to this day you get that feeling of hopelessness, people get attacked for no reason and nothing can save them. Whether it's family-togetherness, love between a couple, or even the law-enforcers at the end, this was all tapping into the uncertainty level people were having at the time and still today it has meaning. Topping this off with Romero's (at the time) large use of gore adds to the overall uneasiness of the film. Finally at the film's current times, there is a great subtle final nail in the coffin attack with the sad fate of the character Ben. Being the only sole voice of reason is shot, which, at the time of filming brought harsh realities of such other African-American leaders who were brought down unfairly such as Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, even if this wasn't the original idea Romero had.Overall, no matter how cheesy some of this movie make look to modern eyes, Night of the Living Dead is a classic for offering horror without a shred of hope, forever influencing every horror movie in it's wake."
"A car drives up a road, towards a graveyard. Cut to the graveyard, a woman and her brother have brought flowers to their mother's grave. Soon the brother starts taunting his sister, saying: ""They're coming to get you, Barbara"". Barbara laughs it off and after her brother runs away, she heads to the seemingly innocent man visiting a family member's grave to apologize, and out of nowhere he grabs her. Her brother attempts to fight him off but ends up being killed in the process and Barbara escapes to a farmhouse nearby.That's how this incredible, highly influential masterclass in horror film making begins. What is still so fascinating about this film is that it retains its ability to genuinely, truly scare the crap out of you. It's not just a 'jump moment' film, George A. Romero sets the mood perfectly with a sublime script and truly effective use of music. As far as modern low budget horror films go, this is nearly the best of them, surpassed only by Sam Raimi's masterpiece ""The Evil Dead"".""Night of the Living Dead"" isn't scary because of the zombies (although the flesh eating sequences are still among the greatest and most horrifying horror scenes ever made). The film is still effective because it all has a feeling of impending doom. It seems hopeless, disturbing, terrifying because of the claustrophobic mood it sets. It's not the zombies that scare us, it's the idea of being trapped in a small area with nowhere to go and death itself standing right outside your door. What a brilliant film!8/10"
"A wave of mass murder sweeps across America as the recently dead return to life to kill and feast on their victims.  A group of people board themselves up in an abandoned house to try and hold out against a small army of the undead. This is the classic low-budget horror film that is the model for recent hits such as the Evil Dead and The Blair Witch Project.  George Romero stages a national disaster but reduces it to a single house for greater effect.  The story focuses on the weaknesses of each of the characters in the house - their cowardice, their greedy, their stupidity etc.  This makes the drama inside the house almost as palatable as the danger from outside and makes the characters more believable and important.The undead are not huge works of special effects, nor are they anything other than lumbering beasts.  But the threat they pose is well demonstrated - the film makes them feel unstoppable and relentless and makes their lingering presence more menacing and less comical than it could have been. The use of an unknown cast also makes it more realistic as none of them have any baggage.  Duane Jones is the standout actor as Ben - who is not without flaws himself.The downbeat, realistic atmosphere to the film gives it a greater sense of tension and continues right through to the very depressing conclusion.  An excellent flagship for low budget horrors."
"The Shining, The Exorcist and The Omen are all films that owe some of their stylistic approach to this film. This is the film that re-wrote the rules of the horror genre as it went along, whilst acting as both social critique and fond homage to 'The Birds' as well.Romero set in place a steady breakdown of all our assumptions of the horror film, which he then utilised to full effect through the rest of this film and the two superb sequels that followed.This is perhaps one of the greatest low budget cult movies ever made, certainly one of the most influential, and in its brutally harrowing documentary style conclusion a harsh statement on American racial attitudes. A statement which is as relevant today as it was over thirty years ago."
"This is ""the"" film that changed the way zombie films were created - more horrifying than ever before. Almost all zombie films that came after this one were patterned after this movie. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is the most iconic zombie film ever made.The movie is outstanding for it's genre and film type. I feel the black & white really enhanced this flick - it gave it an eerier effect than a colour film ever could. The B&W gave the zombies an almost ghostly and most definitely a ghastly appearance. I think if this movie would have been in colour then it would not have the strong appeal and overall creepiness to it that the B&W gave.This is a wonderful late at night film that I would highly recommend to fans of the horror genre. If you have not seen this film yet then you should find a copy to rent, buy or borrow because you will not be disappointed.8.5/10"
"Night of the Living Dead, directed by Geoage A. Romero, is a horror masterpiece and the first of three of his ""Dead"" movies. This low budget horror has changed the way movies are made. This didn't need an ""A"" grade cast and a huge budget to become one the world's greatest and most influential horror movies.This is the simple story of seven strangers who board themselves up in a farmhouse from the ravenous hoards of flesh eating zombies that are rising. But peace doesn't last for long as the tension rises, chaos and tragedy breaks out.This movie today is still shocking. There isn't a lot of gore but the scenes with gore a shocking and disturbing, even though they are in black and white. This is still regarded as one of the best horror movies in the world. 5/5."
"The budget was low.The actors were not the top of the heap,yet Night of the Living Dead is a very effective horror film.It was the film that no doubt set the standard for horror films of today.The whole idea of freshly dead corpses returning from the grave to feed on the living makes my hair stand up,even without the movie.I find myself comparing this film with 1999's The Blair Witch Project.They are similar,not in what they are about,but in how they were made.Both films took very little money to make,used no big name actors,and were very successful and effective in presenting their respective stories.Night does get rather gory and disgusting in places,but overall is worthy of the title of ""classic""."
"This movie succeeds in many respects, that it is the prototype of modern zombies, and many movie situations. It's also good as to where the emphasis is (story and characters) and that it has substance.The emphasis isn't so much on the zombies but on the characters and how they deal with the zombies; the debate as to the best defence, the escape plan. The characters (aside from Harry Cooper) are sympathetic, Ben is just trying to keep the zombies out and figure an escape, Barbara is shocked and delirious, Tom and Judy want to stay together, Helen trusts the judgement of others and cares for Karen, and Karen is unwell. The movie is not boring either, it doesn't drag out, and long.Not only is it the beginning of the zombie genre as we know it, it's also appears to be the beginning of the concept of being besieged that make up many horrors and sci-fis. While there is a debate in the farmhouse, the zombies know what they want and they all want it. And while they aren't a team they do not fight amongst themselves. In modern movies where the protagonists are besieged, the enemy is intelligent, physically strong, fearless, stealthy (in some cases), unusual, works together, often has superior numbers, and has often never been fought before. A number of these factors are possessed by the zombies in this movie. The besieged protagonists in many movies have to deal with limited resources, frightened members, injured members, and an enemy from within. This concept has been passed on to numerous movies since (such as the other ""Dead"" movies, Aliens, Ghosts from Mars, and Dog Soldiers as well as many others), but none have really given the entertainment and substance that this has, with Aliens being the only exception. I cannot speak of the succeeding ""Dead"" movies as I have not yet seen them.This film also has substance (however even though most horror movies are predictable, plot less, and clichéd that is what quite often makes them my escapism; but this one is still superior); there is a plot, the story flows well, has structure, and there are no inconsistencies. It's also backed up with a social commentary, I am not saying a good movie needs to send a message, but it adds to the goodness of this film. It's a social comment on the late Vietnam War era; the establishment don't know what to do and humans are being made into killers (quite literally). And even if you disregard the social-commentary, it still makes good entertainment.The movie achieves everything above, without the use of stunts and over the top special effects.All in all, the result is a good movie, good characters, structure, and substance. One of the best horror movies ever. It has earned itself a 9/10. Romero and Russo do many proud, judging from the votes."
"It is very rare nowadays in Hollywood that $112,000 will cover anything more than the cost of catering on most movies. And yet that was all it took for George Romero and a number of friends of his in Pittsburgh to make what is without a doubt one of the most significant horror films of all times, the 1968 shocker NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Detested by a lot of critics in its day for several scenes of unsettling gruesomeness (though Herschell Gordon Lewis' gore films earlier in the 1960s beat him to the punch for true stomach-turning horror), the film is now understandably highly prized of its relentless, logical approach, and for being so utterly uncompromising.Not much more needs to be said about the plot: it merely involves seven people who have barricaded themselves inside a rural Pennsylvania home after having been attacked by flesh-eating ghouls who have returned to life from the dead as the result of an exploded Venus probe bringing back a dangerous and unknown form of radiation. What Romero and his co-scenarist John Russo (who took partial inspiration for this film from Richard Matheson's classic 1954 end-of-the-world vampire novel ""I Am Legend"") show, however, is the strain built up by the way the characters, especially the ones portrayed by Duane Jones and the film's co-producer Karl Hardman, react to the horror that engulfs them...whether to stay on the ground floor, or to hide in the cellar, and how best to escape even as more and more of the undead surround the place. As it turns out, of course, there is no real way out, and there is no actual good end to the whole horrible situation.Romero, who would continue his travail through the world of the undead through several sequels over the ensuing four decades, shot this film in black-and-white largely on location just outside of Pittsburgh over several weekends in the second half of 1967. NIGHT has, in many ways, the feel of a 1950s ""invasion"" film (think INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), but its setting of an isolated house under siege clearly has its roots in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic THE BIRDS; and the scenes of the ghouls munching on human flesh, though brief in nature, were then, and in many ways still are, shockingly contemporary. The cast of primarily amateur actors does well at being totally naturalistic, and the low budget look of the film gives it a documentary feel that hadn't been seen in horror films before, but which would be revisited in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.Even after four decades of parody, imitation, and sequels, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is still not for those with weak constitutions, and for those who have seen far more graphic shockers, it will likely seem painfully old-fashioned. But for true horror connoisseurs, it is up there with the very best, and is an essential film of its kind and its era."
"Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny travel by car from Pittsburgh to the countryside to visit the gravestone of their father in the cemetery. Out of the blue, they are attacked by a strange man and Johnny is murdered. Barbra runs and releases the brake of Johnny's car since the keys are in his pocket, and flees to an isolated farmhouse, where she locks herself inside. Barbra is in shock and soon she finds a man, Ben (Duane Jones), who is also escaping from the inhuman creatures and he reinforces the doors, windows and openings in the house. He also finds a shotgun and a radio and they learn that the radiation from a satellite that was returning from Venus has somehow reactivated the brain of the dead.Then they find five humans hidden in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) that is sick; and Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry has an argument with Ben, since he believes that the basement is the safest place for them and Harry does not agree. Along the night, the tension between the two men grows while the house is under siege by an increasing legion of living dead. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is my favorite horror movie and I do not know how many times I have watched this movie (the last times had been on 31 March 2001 and 15 January 2002). I was very young the first time I saw it and I was impressed with this movie. Today I have just seen a colorized version and despite my preference for the original black and white classic, I have nothing to say against this latest version.""Night of the Living Dead"" is the debut of the cult director George A. Romero and it is amazing the movie he made with an extremely low-budget. The story is scary and tension increases along 96 minutes running time. The conclusion is ironic and a sort of justice against the decision of Ben, who refused to stay in the basement and caused the death of the whole group. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Noite dos Mortos-Vivos"" (""The Night of the Living Dead"")Note: On 10 August 2014, I saw this film again.On 13 September 2015, I saw this film again."
"Finally after all these years watched the cult hit classic of the now late George A. Romero's ""1968's"" ""Night of the living Dead"". And for it's time this low budget independent picture was a masterpiece that helped change the landscape and gave upcoming horror films a new path to follow. For 1968 and being in black and white it had plenty of gore, death, and blood. And even a few twists and turns in the plot were found.Set in Pennsylvania in a small farm town the nearby graveyard starts to come alive and one by the dead have risen! And oddly enough this is a panic and epidemic that is all over the country!It's a battle of will and determination for survival against the walking undead! Many will not like this film when comparing today's standards of special effects, graphics, and ""CGI"" yet one can see that this old classic was a gateway to current hits like ""The Walking Dead""."
"You can almost time it to the exact second (around 72 mins in) when audiences stopped grinning and laughing behind their hands, expecting just another safe, silly horror film, and started feeling completely and utterly terrified.Before that moment, teenagers didn't get blown up and have their intestines eaten on screen -- it simply didn't happen; everyone always survived in the end, it was fun to be afraid because everyone would be OK when the credits rolled (and this was a period when people took what happened on the big screen a lot more seriously than we do now or ever will again).George A. Romero's debut film doesn't just kill off the sweet innocent teenagers (in the aforementioned most gruesome fashion) -- which would become a staple of horror, along with zombies themselves -- he kills off everyone. Even the film's brave hero, a black man with a shotgun (a subversive decision in itself for the 1960s) gets shot in the head by a pack of zombie-hunting white men and tossed on a bonfire to end the film (the ending is filmed in photographic stills, which creates a somehow more disturbing, documentary-like grisly realism conclusion to the events).What's truly scary about 'Night of the Living Dead' isn't the zombies, it is the behaviour of human beings: it doesn't matter what kind of monster or demon you survive a battle with, in the end it's the ugliness of human nature that is going to defeat you. And for that reason the film will always resonate, no matter how badly the acting and low budget effects age."
"Along with ""Carnival of Souls"", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.This movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African-American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. The ending is quite powerful, and you have to ask yourself, did race have something to do with the actions of the rescue posse? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignore."
"""Night of the Living Dead"" is proof that you do not need a multi-million dollar movie budget to make an unbelievable movie.  This film still frightens many people (including myself) thirty some years after it was made.  It is always amazing to me each time I watch this film how it still manages to appeal to my most basic fear instincts.  There have been countless movies since this one that have been made for a hundred times as much money that I have seen and forgotten, but I am sure this one will always stay with me.This film does such a fine job of shocking and frightening that it is easy to forget how George Romero made it remarkable in other ways.  It was quite a coup in the late 60's to give a black character the lead in a movie and Romero quite cleverly satirizes race relations throughout the film.  I think he is making a point of asking if human beings are really any better than the flesh-eating zombies.  This is most potent at the end, when the black character is assumed to be a zombie and is shot and killed.  Would they have made that mistake with a white person?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  This is also a point that was severely botched in the 1990 remake, when they actually had Tony Todd's character become a zombie.  In a way, that misses the entire point of the original.Regardless, if you are a horror movie aficionado or someone interested in sociology, this movie must be seen.  One thing is for sure.  Love it or hate it, it will always stay with you."
"I am not sure how to go about reviewing this movie since it is my favorite of all time. I watch it every Halloween, without fail, as well as several other of this type. We are talking about a 30 year span here and I still love it!As a MAJOR horror movie buff since the age of about 10, this is the ONLY one that ever terrified me. I saw it in an extremely cut version, as a Saturday afternoon TV movie, and it still left a big impression on me. Most of the ""gory"" scenes were cut but it still scared the heck out of me. Everything about this movie works: from the claustrophobic atmosphere to the black-and-white cinematography ... and everything in between. Director George Romero is, and always will be, the king of the flesh-eating zombie movies.This is the gold star of low budget horror flix. If you have not seen it, and are a horror movie fan, this is a MUST see. Do NOT hesitate, see it now, but remember this movie was made in 1968 and much of the shock value has faded as it has been done in 1000 movies since then. Keep in mind that THIS is the film the pushed the ""gore"" envelope and was the first modern zombie horror film and you can not help but be impressed. Once you see it you will also be compelled to see Romero's equally good sequels ... ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), ""Day of the Dead"" (1985) and ""Land of the Dead"" (2005). The other 2 (""Diary.."" and ""Survival .."") are not up to par, but still better than most of the other movies of this genre, no matter what the ""critics"" on IMDb say.In closing, I cannot recommend this film enough for the serious, and open minded, horror movie fan."
"Romero's gruesome first film, combining gore, 'bona fide' frights horror and in documentary style with skillful characterization, it's one of the most successful independent films of all time. A mysterious plague caused by a satellite that expands a high level of radiation, it creates the recently dead to rise from their graves and scout the countryside and surrounding a farmhouse for feed on and where find shelter a hapless group. The legions of dead people who stalk the house are looking exasperatingly for live humans .The first time the Zombies appeared was in ¨White Zombie(1932)¨. From then on Zombies remained a firm staple of terror B-genre , bringing the dead back to life was a popular pastime in the 30s and 40s. The early zombies were basically genteel beings and generally likable and agreeable types. Romero created in Pittsburg his own production company Image Ten Productions with his friends, John Russo among them and they each contributed 10.000 dollars and formed the budget for his first movie which made Romero world famous. George A. Romero cast an African-American Duane Jones, unusual by the time.When Romero directed this claustrophobic picture , he gave birth to the modern Zombie genre and the film has had a lasting importance, giving interesting consideration to the violence executed by the zombies. It was initially dismissed as exploitation, but when was re-released , it struck deeply with a disillusioned youth angry with the desperation about Vietnam. It was one of the first successful independent terror productions influencing and inspiring countless imitations, copies and rip-offs. Followed by three equally cellebrated sequels, ¨Dawn of the dead(78)¨where the zombies attack a shopping mall ,¨Day of the dead dead(85)¨ about flesh-eating zombies taking over the world and scientific experimenting on zombies and ¨Land of dead(2005)¨ with high budget played by Simon Baker,Asia Argento and Dennis Hooper. And also an inferior remake in 1990 by Tom Savini with Tone Todd(Duane Jones's role) in which again a bunch of people are pursued by ghouls Zombies ."
"This movie used to be broadcast on TV every year on Halloween when I used to live in Pittsburgh. One year it was even broadcast in ""unliving color"". (That was how the colorized version was described.) Colorizing the original black and white movie was a huge mistake as the colors wound up looking fake. The ghouls were given green faces and the Molotov cocktails were colored bright orange.There was also another version I remember seeing on TV one year. Someone had done a parody of the movie by splicing together scenes from the movie and dubbing in their own dialog. In their version, the people in the farmhouse were hosting a party but everyone forgot to bring the groceries! So the problem became how to fight off angry and hungry party guests. In this case, just hand them whatever you can grab (wood, nails, etc). In the scene where Ben flips over the table, the dialog was: ""The first thing we got to do is get rid of the table! If they don't see a table, they won't expect to eat!""after he flips over the table: ""Hey Chlorine! This table has better legs than you do!"" ""Oh really? Can it dance?"", replies Chlorine.The movie then ends with the zombies dancing and saying, ""Let's dance!"".As far as I know however, I don't think this version has ever been released on VHS or DVD. But the original is a movie you can have fun with. Just mute the sound and make up your own dialog."
"Although it is not needed to be said, for any zombie fan, it is anything but obligatory to view this movie because director George A. Romero is the guy who started the whole trend of making zombie films. For the year 1968, this movie had a lot going for it. As for those who may not find that older films have much appeal, this one does. Its story not only carries its own origin but also contains a well thought out written tone and a very addicting plot. Not to mention this film even has gore. Yes, gore.The premise is very basic, a group of random individuals happen to meet up at house to hide from flesh-eating entranced humans, otherwise known as zombies. Bruce Capristo, the head of the makeup department did a great job at making the zombies look like normal people. Yet, the audience and characters alike can tell the difference between themselves and the zombies. Weird as it is, this will be the only movie Capristo would take credit for. After this he did not move on into other movies. It's also surprising to me how after this movie became a hit, that none of the actors really moved forward with their careers either. Because of this, the actors in this movie remain ""no-name"" actors.Which brings me to my next point: characters. In most cases, when a movie has such a basic premise, character development ends up taking a back seat. Why? Because most audiences are more interested in seeing the plot device in action more than they are in the main characters. But what Romero and his screen writing partner, John A. Russo did was balance the screen time between the scenes of confronting zombies and the lead roles discussing how they're going to escape. This keeps the audience from becoming too bored with too much dialog or too much zombies. This holds true because too much of one thing isn't good in general. There needs to be a balance.What remains the most potent about this picture is just how overwhelming this situation is and how quickly hope can be lost if this were to be a reality. Oddly enough, one would think that because zombies move so slowly, it would be easy to evade them. Better think twice about that claim. Even for these undead beings, they are relentless. To think if you had twenty to fifty of them around you,...sounds like its time to curl up in fetal position and go to that happy place every person has in their head. This is what Romero does with his audience, by creating a hopeless tone. It will seem like any direction taken towards escaping won't work and it's done very effectively.But while this is effective, another great aspect to this tone is by instilling a small glimmer of hope every time an opportunity opens. This is what makes this story so gripping. I would feel right to let go and give up, but it wouldn't because you know there has to be a way to win. Also, the musical composer, William Loose did a fair job at the score. It definitely sounds like music and it does contain a reoccurring theme for the film and for the zombies themselves, so it does work.The last area that surprised me was just how gory this late 1960's black and white film was. I mean, how did audiences back then take this film? People must have flipped out so much that it caused mass hysteria. It's obvious in a lot of scenes that the people parts used in the zombie scenes were animal parts but wow. I'm surprised Romero was let back into the film business after that. I actually wasn't expecting much at all but I'm pretty sure Romero had a lot more to put on the screen. I liked how things went with Romero's first film piece. It was evenly paced and kept me wondering what would happen next. How many films are like that nowadays?Film legend George A. Romero has brought a treasure to generations to come, even if many would call it at the time malignant. When in fact, zombies are exactly that in our culture today. Night of the Living Dead is well constructed and boasts gross imagery even for 1968."
"Note: There will be a full review of ""Night of the Living Dead"" coming soon, but until then, here's this, which will probably be deleted after I write a full-lenghth one.Night of the Living DeadClassic ""zombie movie that started them all"" about a young lady visiting a graveyard who seeks refuge in a nearby home with an assortment of various other passersby who find strange creatures attacking them from outside the house. Extremely low-budget and occasionally laughable in terms of flaws, George A. Romero's classic movie is riveting, horrifying and, quite simply, a classic of the genre. The primary inspiration for M. Night Shyamalan's hit film ""Signs"" (2002). An amazing horror film that proves you don't always need huge budgets and special effects to scare an audience.*****"
"The grandfather of low budget horror films, George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead started a whole new genre of horror.Folks become trapped in an isolated country house by an army of walking, flesh-eating corpses.Night of the Living Dead is simply one of the most effectively terrifying and completely captivating horror films ever made! It stands as a great example of imagination over budget and has influenced scores of horror pictures. Romero gives us a very dark atmospheric kind of wonder that spans the entire film from its bleak opening frames to its eerie closing montage. The story is full of claustrophobic suspense and unrelenting chills! Even now, several decades after its making, this film is still as frightening as ever. In fact few horror films ever reach the terribly scary heights of Night of the Living Dead.The films cast is great. Duane Jones is strong as the leading man. Judith O'Dea is touching and sympathetic as a traumatized young woman. Russ Steiner is memorable as O'Dea's joking brother, who delivers the films most haunting line ""they're coming to get you Barbara..."". The good supporting cast includes Karl Hardman as a hateful refugee, Marilyn Eastman as his wife, and Keith Wayne as a young man seeking escape.Through and through, Night of the Living Dead is one of the greatest genre films ever made! It's solid proof that true horror never loses its effectiveness.**** out of ****"
"I was flicking through the TV guide which told me the remake of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was being shown on the Sci-Fi channel so I sat down to watch it. I did like the ground breaking original so eagerly awaited seeing the 1990 version which started with a car driving down a lonely country road just like the original , it was also filmed in black and white just like the original and it was at this point I realised I wasn`t watching the remake- I was watching the original . This wasn`t the first time a certain TV guide got films mixed up because a couple of weeks ago it confused the 1967 war film THE YOUNG WARRIORS with the 1983 vigilante thriller about high school students and their poodle wiping out scumSlightly disappointed I wouldn`t be seeing the colour remake I still sat down to watch the original because as I said I remember liking it from years ago . I wasn`t disappointed with what I saw but the flaws do jump out at you and bite you in the neck . The acting isn`t very good with Judith O Dea over acting with the rest of the cast under acting . This a great pity because if we had the same type of performances seen in something like 12 ANGRY MEN this movie would have been a masterpiece . I also couldn`t help noticing a few editing errors where it`s suddenly pitch black outside then it flicks to broad daylight then it`s pitch black again , and I don`t think I`ve seen many films recently with such an intrusive soundtrack . I can however forgive these flaws because NOTLD is guerilla film making at its very best , it`s got a simple strength and that is it has a very good script where both imagination and drama grabs you and doesn`t let go - A crashed satillite returning from Venus reanimates the dead ? Utter nonsense of course but the scenario is so well written you can`t help being swept along with the terror as the protagonists watch the world disintergrate on TV . Compare this movie to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and tell me what one is more enjoyable ? No contest is it ?I liked this movie many years ago and still like it today . Such a pity the production values didn`t come up to the standards of the script , but that said it`s still more compelling than the stuff coming out of Hollywood today"
"""I was trying to come up with a concept about a new society, revolutionary...in political terms, that's taking over and devouring the old society."" – George A. Romero George Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead"" marked the implosion of the white, middle class, American nuclear family and portrayed the collapse of post-war patriarchal authority into a kind of mad hysteria. What followed - the sexual, political and social ""revolutions"" of the 1960s - were not so much rebellions against tyrannical paternal and political despots, or against the rigid repressions of suburban family life, as they were carnivalesque revelations that the emperor had no clothes. That 1950s suburbia offered nothing but hypocrisy and fake decor. As such, Romero has his nuclear family holed up in a farmhouse - the impotence of the father mirroring the clownishness and impotence of various authority figures on his television screen - until the unit collapses under the weight of its own stupidity and children-turned-zombies avidly consume their own parents. As is always the case with Romero, the zombies are actually the good guys, the new zombie order literally consuming the outmoded old. The zombie horde then become a darkly humorous vision of hippie communalism who are the preferred refuge of the children of the white middle class.But the rebellions of the 1960s went nowhere, hope fading and forgotten. Hippies and campus radicals from middle-class backgrounds grew up to be yuppies, and their influence on the larger culture was mostly a matter of an easily saleable ""lifestyle."" Once the social upheavals of the 60s had passed, consumerism turned out to be the real winner, so it's entirely appropriate that Romero's second zombie movie, ""Dawn of the Dead"", takes place in a shopping mall. Here our heroes live a fantasy of commodity abundance and unhinged consumption, whilst the zombies draw inexorably closer, the mall reminding them of their happiest pre-death moments. In this world there is no satisfaction, only lack, the zombie's unquenchable lust for flesh mocking the consumer's unquenchable desires.Then came ""Day of the Dead"", arguably the best film in the series. Here, 60s radicalism and 70s consumerism are shunted aside in favour for an assault on Reaganism and the military/scientific complex, where pathologically macho soldiers try to keep the zombies at bay whilst scientists try with futility to either ""destroy the zombie plague"" or ""tame the zombies"". The film is relentless in its deconstruction of military authoritarianism and scientific claims to supreme authority, but mostly it's the film's treatment of Freud's reality/pleasure principle and its thick fatalism which makes it so unique. Here, the zombies embody a kind of sympathetic, undeveloped and (pre-language, pre-entry-into-the-Symbolic) ego-less desire (they do not know why they want/desire), which contrasts with the libidinal economy and the twisted viciousness of the human characters (who bury the true motivations of their desires and hypocritically stand for social order).Each of Romero's zombie movies were intended to be a snapshot of the decade in which they was released; ""Night"" the 60s, ""Dawn"" the 70s and ""Day"" the 80s. ""Land of the Dead"", for financial reasons, was released in the 21st century, but it is actually a broad critique of 90s American society. Here, social class and warfare comes to the foreground, the film imagining America as a paranoid bastion of humanity and freedom, standing tall against the ""foreign horde"". In ""Land of the Dead"", the ruling class live lives of elegance and supreme wealth in the exclusive and gated high-rises of ""Fiddler's Green"", while the masses outside do their dirty bidding and scrape by on low incomes, distracting themselves from their worries with sex, drugs, gambling and violence. The leader of this late-capitalist America, a George Bush styled madman out to make the rich richer and who ""refuses to negotiate with terrorists"", subsists by sending into zombie territory teams of mercenaries who steal zombie loot (he achieves this by distracting the zombies with fireworks- a kind of metaphor for media spectacle and social brainwashing). The zombies themselves are, once again, the good guys, often linked with the rebelling humans who wish to rise up against their overlords. When the zombies break into the city - led by a black zombie of course - it's symbolic of the proletariat finally rising against their masters and demanding restitution and justice, though Romero knows this is but a futile, 1960s pipe dream. He ends the film with the zombies defeated, the humans infected, and the rebels disillusioned, the masses going their separate ways at the end of the film, wandering off into the horizon like so many disillusioned cinematic anti-heroes of cinema's golden age, specifically the existential road movies of the early 1970s.8.5/10 – ""Day of the Dead""8/10 – ""Land of the Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead""7.5/10 – ""Night of the Living Dead"" Despite their tiny budgets and at times poor acting, these films still operate fairly well as popcorn movies. What elevates them, though, is the allegorical qualities of Romero's trashy plots."
"This is possibly the most influential zombie movie ever made. Astonishingly made with a small budget but still dreadfully terrifying. Director: George Romero, writers: John Russo and George Romero, year of release: 1968, genre: horror, themes: desperation, apocalypse, survival and division. Now the plot is simple: a group of people barricade themselves inside an abandoned house in order to survive the onslaught of reanimated, flesh-eating ghouls. But what makes the movie most interesting is the story and interaction of the characters. None of them were heroic, they seemed pretty human and empathetic. They were divided because they each had their own agenda, which led to division between them. They could work together but they could not agree upon how to get out alive. That eventually led to the characters demise, because although they were all human they were not able to stand together. Ironic, since man has reason in contrast to the ghoul who had no reason, the ghouls were better at working together than the characters.That is a pretty strong social commentary, because if we reflect on reality we have war, pollution and division between the rich and the poor. Through our values, culture and norms we create division among ourselves. That is a pretty interesting theme and a stable of Romero's later on in his movies. Out of 'Night of the Living Dead' a question such as ""who is more dangerous, man or ghoul?"" might arise. Actually I feel it rises such a question, so in a way the movie is questioning our values. Because, although that is what makes us strong as a race that is also our downside, because we might not be able to compromise our values. Anyhow, before 'Night of the Living Dead' movies were not this gory. This movie had explicit gore which lead to controversy, with critics at that time calling it an ""unrelieved orgy of sadism"". Of course, times have changed and the gore and violence in movies have tremendously increased. So by today's standards the gore in this movie is pretty tame. But it still delivers unrelenting terror and dread. I remember watching it the first time and I got petrified. I also watched it with a friend - who is a gore and horror movie hound - and the movie completely stunned us both.It can be attributed to the script, story and characters because as time went on in the movie, the more desperate the characters became. So the suspense and tension was slowly building up as well as the dread. Then the audience had no choice but to embrace the terror of doom and dread.A cult-classic that has definitely stood the test of time. 10/10"
"George A. Romero is one of the most well-known and profitable directors of the genre, thanks to half of his films being the ""Dead"" movies. Other movies in his career, such as ""Martin"" and ""The Crazies,"" are notable, but it's Romero's first film, ""Night of the Living Dead,"" that gets all the attention. The 1968 zombie classic made his career, and influenced many follow-ups.Johnny and Barbara are brother and sister. They travel to a cemetery to visit their mother before her grave is moved. Barbara does not take too kindly to the cemetery, it disturbs her. Johnny playfully jokes with her, saying ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" And once a slow-moving man approaches them and attacks, the nightmare begins. Johnny is killed and Barbara flees for her life. She finds shelter in a tiny, deserted farmhouse. Soon, she realizes that she's not the only one hiding out. Five other people have isolated themselves in, and the struggle to survive continues. Boarding up the house is only a temporary delay before more flesh-eating ghouls attack. Should they stay upstairs or hide out in the cellar? In a time when hilariously awful B-grade horror films were being produced, ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a shocking surprise, and still is. The MPAA rating system had a fit with Romero's film, and when it was released to the public, it scared the living daylights out of everyone, including little kids who thought they were seeing a normal Saturday matinée(Roger Ebert's rave review for the film also examines the reactions of the audience).The film definitely has an advantage in being shot in black and white. It gives off the feeling of an amateur documentary, that this could really happen.Next to the mood and atmosphere, why does ""Night of the Living Dead"" work so horrifyingly well? Well, in all of Romero's movies, not just the ""Dead"" films, there is social commentary littered throughout. And you'll definitely find that this film has a message or two. Some saw the film as an insight into racism. It was the first film to have an African-American hero, after all. But Romero chose Duane Jones for Ben simply because he fit the part. Also, many fans examine the film as an example of the Communist movement, that you couldn't trust anyone or anything. The zombies could be anybody. They could be your neighbor, your daughter, your husband or wife. It is truly a scary concept.The film also has undeniable claustrophobia. We are uncomfortably sealed in with the survivors, and once the zombies get in, we're not getting out. Not even the cellar can help our protagonists.In 1968 and today's generation, ""Night of the Living Dead"" rang and still does ring true to every viewer. Is this what our world will come to be? Will we be unable to trust the ones we know? Will they become emotionless, mindless murderers, and will our society crumble? Romero's film is not just a 60's horror film, and it never ages. Despite the difference in years, the dead are very much alive."
"I have been a Horror buff since I was 4 & have seen just about every movie that was considered by some worthy of being called scary. NOLD is the ""ONLY"" movie to succeed in scaring me still to this day, it has what I consider to be all the elements of true horror. The Antagonists are us only dead, they are all different, some rotting,some all busted up, some limbless, I could go on & on. They ""ALL have these things in common, They are dead, You can't reason with them, they can only be put down by destroying the brain so even if you were all armed to the teeth no matter how slow they are, if you made a break for it at night when you can't see more than 10 feet in front of you, you will eventually be caught & be eaten alive by corpses unless you turn your gun on yourself if possible. The worst thing to me would be just waiting for the inevitable along with the tension of the other individuals arguing amongst each other to make matters worse. Give me the fast zombies, at least it would be over quick. With fast zombies you wouldn't have time to get that scared, they'd be on you like that, with the slow ones, the anticipation of them finally trying to break in would be too much."
"Everyone seems to thinks Ben is the hero of Night of the Living Dead but in reality he's just as short tempered and petty as Harry Cooper and more importantly, he was wrong about the basement being a deathtrap.He rants and raves like a tyrant, ""I'm in charge up here! Everything we have up here stays up here!"" etcetera.In the scene where he's locked outside and the cowardly Mr. Cooper is too frightened to open the door, he shoots Cooper in a display of petty anger.Ben is no hero. In the end he only seems to be able to save himself in Harry Cooper's basement deathtrap.Everybody is fooled by his presentation. He's good looking, black, and articulate, so what? Don't confuse that with righteousness.Watch the movie again with my comments in mind before you click NO."
"I am a zombie aficionado, no doubt about it. And as such, then of course I enjoy this 1968 movie by George A. Romero, because it is a milestone in the zombie genre. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is essentially the foundation for the zombie genre, and it paved the way for the genre and shaped it into what we have today. And as such, then Romero really established something unique and cemented his own name to be forever associated with the living dead.I am not going to be a fanboy and look past all the flaws and shortcomings to this movie, because they are there, for sure. But still, this is an entertaining movie, and taking into consideration the year in which it was made and released, was quite a bold venture into the cinema.Without delving too deep into the storyline, as I assume that as a horror fan you will already be more than familiar with ""Night of the Living Dead"" in one of the many variants it has come in. It is about a group of strangers trapped in a small farm house with hordes of the living dead surrounding them, wanting to eat their flesh.The story has been made immortal by George A. Romero, certainly, and it is an entertaining story that is brought to the screen by a rather visionary directing at the time being. And the cast that they had gotten together for the movie were also doing quite good jobs. There were some rather memorable performances throughout the movie.As for the effects, well, take into consideration that this movie is from 1968, so it would seem rather crude by today's standards. But the effects serve their intent and purpose well enough, and helped to flesh out the movie on the screen, no pun intended.""Night of the Living Dead"" is a movie that you can't be familiar with if you are a zombie aficionado. And even for newcomers to the zombie genre, then ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a MUST watch to fully embrace the genre and understand its roots."
"""Night of the Living Dead"" is dirty, unwholesome and indefensible. We return to it for the same reason we go back to sleep and willingly return to a nightmare. We want to revel in ugliness and horror. The same is true for two other powerful horror movies, ""The Exorcist"" and ""Psycho."" All three are nasty pieces of work; this one is merely the crudest.George Romero directed, co-wrote and co-produced this exploitation film on a shoestring budget with bad actors. The script is well-plotted, but the dialogue is bad whenever the characters reveal backstory or talk about their feelings. The direction, photography and editing are amazingly skillful considering the limitations on money; and the creepy stock music is deftly chosen throughout.To review the cast: the leading lady overacts. The black leading man looks uncomfortable whenever he has large chunks of dialogue. The two young lovers are extremely ill at ease. The angry father hits one note and hits it loud. The mother often hesitates slightly after her cues. The TV people, however, come off as natural and often comic, especially the simpleminded sheriff and the real-life Pittsburgh newsman.Many of the scenes are memorable for their combination of the everyday and the extraordinary. Who can visit a graveyard without thinking of the lumbering man who turns out to be a killer zombie? The whole fantastic idea of the dead eating the living can be seen as a metaphor for the familiar conflict between the past and the present.The filmmakers recall Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" when the zombies invade the boarded-up farmhouse, scenes that have themselves been parodied and imitated endlessly. This familiarity adds to the feeling that we're watching something we once dreamt. The most unpleasant scene, even worse than the zombies chomping on human flesh or fighting over intestines, is the spade murder in the cellar. This is a crude imitation of Hitchcock's infamous shower scene in ""Psycho,"" but Hitchcock's (and Saul Bass's) artistry allow us to coldly admire it even while reveling in its horror and perversity. The spade scene allows us no such distance. It is undiluted nastiness.""Night"" ranks among the scariest horror movies, partly for raising the bar on gore. Yet raising the bar far higher has made later horror movies far less scary. By the 1980s, horror movies were gore-splattered freak shows with expensive puppets, and now they're freak shows with digital characters that seem to belong in video games. ""Night of the Living Dead,"" by contrast, looks like a documentary."
"This was a true original, a labor of both love and craftsmanship for George Romero and his friends. It was made for a pittance in Pittsburgh. And it began a series of imitations and sequels, none of which get bonus points for determination or originality.Judith O'Dea and her brother, Russell Streiner, visit their parents' grave in a remote cemetery. O'Dea prays solemnly while Streiner, evidently a non-believer, playfully mocks her and teases her about a disheveled man approaching them -- ""Here he comes. They're coming to get you. Woooo."" And suddenly this creepy character who looks like Art Carney DOES grab her and viciously starts wrestling her to the ground. When Streiner intervenes, he's knocked out, allowing O'Dea a few moments to escape. It's a shocking scene. The gray and barren cemetery looks like the setting for a family drama or even a comedy, and it's suddenly horror time.O'Dea winds up being barricaded in an empty farm house along with half a dozen other varied characters. One of them, inevitably, is the stock character who is domineering, dilatory, and stupid. Prima inter pares is a bright, industrious, practical African-American, whose race is never brought up.The trapped humans can't make any phone calls as zombies, by ones and twos, gather around the old house. It quickly becomes apparent that they're afraid of light. At the same time, a light bulb goes on in the head of the experienced viewer, that sooner or later the power will fail and the electric lights go off, leaving the house in darkness except for what light can be provided by improvised torches, burning furniture, and Molotov cocktails.It's a good cheap movie with a couple of revolting scenes, including the horde of revenants chomping with no visible enthusiasm on the barbecued bodies of a young couple caught in an exploding pickup truck. Chomping on the beautiful young woman is not so objectionable but there is such a thing as excess. It's a nice touch that Judith O'Dea is so shocked by her narrow escape and her brother's death that it takes her some time to recover. Usually, the character gets about thirty seconds.One by one, the living humans are pulled out of the house or otherwise captured by the zombies and eaten by them. Here the direction is sometimes very clumsy. The windows have been hastily boarded over. There are a dozen zombies outside with their hands reaching in through the spaces. You have a rifle and you know you can kill the zombies by shooting them through the head. So -- do you stick the muzzle of your rifle through the spaces between the boards, where the mortified hands can grasp the barrel and pull the rifle away? No. No, you don't.I didn't care for the ending at all. A sheriff's detail has been making its rounds, killing the zombies off until all are now gone. As they approach the farm house, the lone survivor peeks at them from a window. ""There's another one!"" And, POW, the lone survivor is no more. Everybody -- including those we've come to care for -- winds up mincemeat. ""King Lear"" was a tragedy too but it tried to tell us something about human nature. In this instance everyone dies because the writers decided arbitrarily that they should.Still gets bonus points, though, for being the first of its kind."
"Like everyone else reviewing this film, I'm a horror fan. Hopefully, they're all horror fans too. I think I have good taste and know a good horror movie when I see it. Night of the Living Dead is considered one of the greatest and most important horror films of all time. It's impossible to ignore that and the fact that the film's director, George A. Romero, gets a lot of attention because of it. With the current state of the genre, tastes and styles continuing to change so much and so fast, a lot of the attention on Romero is negative. Many young horror fans are going back to see his earlier films and wondering why they are, and he is, so famous. I consider Romero to be a horror director with a very inconsistent record of hits and misses. He's mostly known for his ""Dead"" series of zombie films, but it's also worth mentioning that he has a lot of military plots in his films. In Night, you don't really see the military, rather you see an army on TV, comprised of gun-carrying U.S. citizens.The 1960's were a decade where a great deal of Hollywood films went into color. While Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 hit Psycho was in black and white, 1961's Breakfast at Tiffany's was in color. And the trend went back and forth again, until into the 1970's, where almost no films at all were released in black and white (except for David Lynch's Eraserhead). For the purpose of mood, most 60's horror films remained in black and white (The Haunting, Repulsion, Village of the Damned, Black Sunday, Spider Baby, The Innocents, Carnival of Souls). About black and white itself, it's often a very boring way to watch films. But it's also quite gritty. And used by certain filmmakers to achieve a realistic tone to their films' subject matter. Especially in the 60's. Most of Night of the Living Dead certainly feels realistic. For its' time, at least. It seems to be a movie about a group of people trapped inside a fairly enclosed space, with tensions mounting, then things reach a boiling point and their shelter starts to feel like a tomb.Night of the Living Dead features zombies and raises the question of where they come from without doing much to answer it. That's because we follow the characters as they enter the farmhouse and they wait for news or for others to come to their rescue. So, realistically, were we in the same position as any one of the characters, we would know only what the TV and radio were telling us. There were zombie films made before Night- White Zombie and Plague of the Zombies, as well as potentially, any film featuring The Mummy. And Frankenstein, as well, is a re-animated corpse. But while those were relegated to being cult films and failed to break through into the American mainstream, Night did in fact make a big impact on American filmgoers. I believe it may have first cracked the drive-ins. And, if there were grindhouse theaters at that time, this probably played quite a few of those. With a film like this, you really have to consider and know its' history before passing judgment on it. Also, when you do pass judgment, you have to make it personally relevant.Night has - and I know I'm not alone in seeing it this way - not aged well. It remains what it was in the 60's and styles in the genre changed so fast, the film's approach as horror was near completely obsolete by the arrival of Wes Craven's shocking and much less restrained debut, The Last House on the Left, a mere 4 years later. Though 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was something of a return to Night's much less overt and in-your-face violence, Hollywood's approach to horror was also becoming more explicit, as early as 1973's The Exorcist, one of the bloodiest and most graphic horror films of its day. But even in the case of Chainsaw, the message was clear- black and white was being permanently retired by cutting edge, amateur film directors getting their start in the horror genre. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing for Night. The film became an instant classic. But it also, I think, failed to keep its' impact into the mid-1970's and the rapidly changing styles.My personal feeling on the film is that it is mostly boring. As its' focus is more on human-created tensions, I admire Romero and the fact that Night's been mostly successful (as the IMDb's rating can attest to) with film fans. But, this film is too realistic to be scary. I find films scarier when they are more like a nightmare, even surreal, but with elements of reality. Depending on the concept, horror films that concentrate more on characterization often lack a true sense of the chaotic and irrational quality of a person's worst nightmare. In a situation like this, where people are upsetting you and challenging everything you say and do, I feel more apt to be angry than scared. However, the film does have a few standout sequences that are an important signature to any good horror movie. One is a death scene involving a gardening spade. Another is a montage of zombies eating the internal organs of their victims. And the last is a scene of one of the main characters, Barbra, having a dissociative fugue while walking through the empty farmhouse (a moment that feels torn right out of Carnival of Souls, which Romero admits was an influence on Night)."
"Any self-respecting horror fan should be familiar with the plot for this one - when Barbra and Johnny visit their father's grave he is attacked and killed by a ghoul, while she manages to escape and find refuge in a farmhouse. Inside she finds other survivors but before long they are surrounded by flesh eating reanimated corpses...
Zombie films were nothing new in 1968, they could be traced back at least until the 1930's (White Zombie), and a few had been shot in colour by this time (The Dead One - 1961; Hammer's Plague of the Zombies). But what sets Romero's film apart is that here the dead aren't brought back to life by voodoo but by radiation, therefore giving a modern, scientific explanation to it. And unlike previous zombies these ones devour human flesh. Both these factors were to prove pivotal in the sub-genre and 50 years on countless zombie films have been made (not always a good thing!). Horror critic/historian Kim Newman credits NOTLD as being the first modern horror film and indeed he has a good point, though in my opinion I would give that honour to Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho. And gore by 1968 was nothing new (the films of HG Lewis, eg Blood Feast).
This was filmed on a low budget and at times it shows. Some of the acting is a little wooden, including a few of the ghouls. But Romero manages to deliver a powerful film in which the tension steadily builds (it is quite heavy on dialogue at times) to it's shocking finale. I'm not including a spoiler but one death in particular is very brutal, especially for it's time. There are obviously political references here too, just as there are in say Dawn of the Dead.
It's a movie that deserves to be viewed several times but be warned - there are many releases out there and they can vary greatly in quality. These include colourised versions, one of which I have just watched. OK, it shows up the gore but otherwise it's pretty pointless. This was filmed in black and white and that's how it's meant to be seen. If you consider yourself a horror/zombie fan but have not yet seen this then you really need to!"
"I should alert readers that I am not very knowledgeable about the modern zombie genre, so my review should be taken accordingly as one by an unenlightened old geezer who is not at all hip to the twenty first century.This classic horror movie's greatest strength is the successful ""creepiness factor"" that was so carefully developed by director George Romero from the very first moment. After many viewings, I am still terrified when the man walking among the cemetery monuments (Bill Heinzman) suddenly begins to attack Barbara (Judith O'Dea) before moving on to her brother, Johnny, (Russell Streiner), and then begins to chase her into an isolated farmhouse before being joined by what becomes an army of his fellow ghouls, mysteriously raised from the dead. Heinzman not only imitates Karloff very well, but he looks like him! It's a very frightening nightmare brought realistically to life on the screen.Although the music is stock material, it was well chosen for its fear effect and downright eeriness. Considering its low budget, Romero's ability to create a film that reaches such a high mark on the chill meter is very commendable. In other words, I was scared spineless from the very start.One of the problems with the film, however, is that it fails to sustain the intensity of its opening scenes and loses its punch along the way. I understand that the dialogue is often spontaneous, but it is also often weak, as is at least some of the acting. This may be controversial, but I didn't get the racial theme that many IMDb reviewers noted. I saw Ben as just another ""non-dead"" victim without observing any social or political significance in the color of his skin. Harry views both Ben and Tom, who is white, with contempt. I didn't understand why Ben didn't shout out ""Help! I'm not a zombie!"" as soon as he heard gunshots outside. He had to know that the zombies were incapable of aiming and shooting weapons. Also, the scientists and military officials in Washington were not very credible. They were actually laughable, as was their silly dialogue.In spite of the weaknesses, this film remains as a remarkable, pioneering classic in the horror genre, and it will continue to arouse much fear and trepidation within me for some time to come."
"This was director George A. Romero's feature film debut — wild to think about considering the classics he has under his belt now (Dawn of the Dead, Creepshow, Monkey Shines) and just how known his name is. Reading some of the reviews that were made at the time is equally wild, such as this one from The New York Times: ""Night of the Living Dead is a grainy little movie acted by what appear to be nonprofessional actors, who are besieged in a farm house by some other nonprofessional actors who stagger around, stiff-legged, pretending to be flesh- eating ghouls.""I mean, they aren't wrong, but this movie still holds up as a cult classic among horror lovers — who HASN'T said ""they're coming to get you, Barbra!"" in an imitation of poor short-lived Johnny's voice? It did well upon its release, too — despite a budget of just $114,000 it grossed $12 million domestically and $18 million internationally. It seems surprising now, since much of mainstream horror is FILLED with unspeakably disturbing images, that it was criticized at the time for its ""explicit gore"". It's part one of three (followed by Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead) — the stories for each film all written at the same time but executed with quite a few years in between each release — and Romero has talked about it being heavily influenced by Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend.It was the first movie to introduce the modern idea of a zombie — though they never use the actual word, opting instead for both ""murderer"" and ""ghoul"" — as a reanimated, flesh-devouring creature.It's heavily ad-libbed and roughly shot — no real bells and whistles here, though I admired the stark black and white and the use of shadow and light throughout. I think it added to the movie in a real way to have it feel so raw and real.Whether it was initially intended by Romero or not, there's lots of commentary and themes throughout: on society in the 60's as a whole and peoples' disillusionment towards law enforcement and authority as a whole, the Vietnam war (""We may not enjoy living together, but dying together isn't going to solve anything.""), and racism (Ben being chased by an all white zombie mob with a torch was very reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan, the upper class white man being offended and angry by Ben not ceding to his wishes and to his grabs for power, Ben surviving an attack of the undead only to be killed by a group of white law enforcement). Romero has said that he didn't cast Ben — a black lead among an entirely white cast — on purpose, or as any kind of statement; he said he simply gave the best audition. But once Duane Jones was cast and they started filming, they became aware of the symbolism and the themes that it was important to play into. In general, it was less about monsters turning against people, but people turning against people — there is no real community formed, no solid efforts to work together to face the threats head on. They are very divided throughout the whole film, and more of them are killed by human error and mistakes rather than the undead themselves.Barbra was like a silent movie star — so expressive despite not much dialogue. She becomes almost catatonic early on in the movie, and there's lots of tension between her and Ben in several scenes — again, playing into the racism and general attitude towards people of color in the 60's.I do love that they never call them ""zombies"" — one of the news reports on the radio said ""there is an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins"", they are called ""marauding ghouls"", and, one of my favorite lines: ""yeah, they're dead, they're all messed up"". Apt.There's several amazing shots that I loved: the shot of the open field as the ghouls all silently lurch toward the house is great. The overall feeling of dread and suffocation is awesome. Them feasting on the bodies in the car was definitely a contributor to the ""explicit gore"" mentioned. And the zombie daughter killing her own mother by repeated stabs with a spade — as writer R.H.W. Dillard, a defender of the taboo in the film, said, ""What girl has not, at one time or another, wished to kill her mother?"".But maybe my favorite was when the zombies finally are fully encircling the house, beating on doors and windows, and the camera pans to each actor as they express their concern and fear, the lighting as dramatic as ever, everyone SO expressive. The ghouls are slow but unrelenting, and in that moment you kind of feel the full weight of hopelessness.And then there's the ending — solidifying humans being more dangerous to one another than any outside force, the unreliability of those in power, and the fear of any ""outsiders"" clouding our judgment to a fatal degree. I loved the darkness of it, the finality.I don't think I even need to say it, but it's a classic for a reason — worth a watch if you've never had the pleasure (or a re-watch if you have!)."
"Now this is firmly embraced by the (art) community in the form of LoC's and MoMA's seal of approval, it has been beautifully digitally restored in a 4K DCP version. As the mother of all zombie movies it deserves this treatment.Made in 1968 on a low budget most of the crew had multiple roles in the movie, thus we see the producer back as a zombie for example. Romero placed the movie in real, ordinary locations and that was one big innovation for the genre. And it is after all these years still scary as hell in the horror scenes, but the long preparation scenes in between and radio and TV broadcasts coming through are now somewhat old-fashioned and actually boring. The ending is still as intriguing as the movie itself.There has been a lot of second-guessing about the double meaning of this movie. While the sequel was clearly about consumerism, this has over the years had many interpretations: criticizing American society, the wrongs of cold war politics, racism, misogyny, government and media disinformation and mistrust, the Vietnam war and the military at large. A certain theme is the overall apathy by the general public, the so-called silent majority. Gary Streiner, sound engineer of the movie, dismissed most interpretations recently during the Berlinale Classics screening as unintended but in interviews Romero has said the movie reflected the tensions of the time: ""It was 1968, man. Everybody had a 'message'""."
"It took me along time to watch this classic, I've seen more of the modern zombie movies over the past 20 years. and after each viewing of said movies I've always thought you know I should give the original masterpiece a try. I thoroughly enjoyed it, I didn't mind that the zombies were slow and hard to understand,, this movie was groundbreaking at the time so I didn't expect a lot of zombie attack action,, the opening scene is frightening to a point. especially in the graveyard. eventually our heroine makes it back to a farmhouse after seeing her brother be left for dead by a zombie, there she meets a black man who kinda runs the house,, together they try and board up all the doors and windows.. later on in the basement there is another family down there taking care of a sick child, and this is where things start to get interesting bickering , arguing amongst the men as to the best way to defend the house, and whether to stay on the top floor of the house or be in the basement,, watch and find out whose idea was better. i'm glad I've seen this movie and have watched it twice and will many more times."
"Night of The Living Dead, the king of all zombie films. Night of The Living Dead was a low budget masterpiece in 1968. Who would have thought of such a morbid, yet extremely enjoyable film, except George A. Romero, probably one of the most influential film makers i've ever come across. George A. Romero, Creator of Night of The Living Dead, Dawn of The Dead, Day of The Dead, Land of The Dead, Diary of The Dead, and Survival of The Dead, Martin, and a whole lot more, wow what an exceptionally superb film maker! Despite many other opinions that Dawn of The Dead was the best, Dawn of The Dead would not be here if it wasn't for the first and in my opinion best of them all Night of The Living Dead 10/10"
"A threatening musical score counterpoints a tranquil country road setting in the opening scene of ""Night of the Living Dead""; that road appropriately leading to a cemetery. Very soon, a childhood torment becomes a reality as brother Johnny repeats to his sister - ""They're coming to get you Barbra..."" The first undead creature they encounter results in tragedy, as Johnny stumbles and cracks his head on a stone. Barbra (correct spelling as listed in the credits) for her part breaks the first rule of zombie escape as she heads for a confined space, a lonely country home in the middle of nowhere.We learn that others have beaten her there, having retreated to safety in the wake of mass revivals of dead corpses, the story gradually revealed via a series of radio and television broadcasts. Apparently, radiation on an earthbound satellite that was part of a Venus probe has triggered some kind of awakening in the brains of the recently deceased. The victims have become a ""virtual army of unidentified assassins"", having a penchant for the flesh of living human beings.It would be easy to dismiss NOTLD as a trash zombie flick, but if you follow it closely, an intelligent exposition of the story transcends the film's limited budget and it's skimpy production values. In fact it's the dark and grainy aspect of the movie that gives it a character and a step up on the typical ""B"" grade horror flicks of the preceding era. The classic scene of the nighttime advancing corpses is one that will stay with you long after the movie is over.The movie maintains it's story line consistency as well; when the Cooper's young daughter succumbs to her illness and dies, she comes alive hungry for human flesh and without regard for her closest target, dear old mom. In turn, Helen Cooper comes back none the worse for wear after young Gina hands her a thrashing in spades. As the zombie horde finally breaks into the farm house, protagonist hero Ben barricades himself in the cellar against his own earlier advice, killing the Cooper's a second time, as advised by news reporters covering the countrywide phenomenon - ""Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul"".It's the little things that writer/director George Romero pays attention to as well that make this a horror classic. Remember brother Johnny - well he shows up later in a quick cameo as a member of the zombie horde, returning for his sister.I recall how ""Night of the Living Dead"" created a stir upon it's original release in 1968. Now almost forty years later, movie making technology has advanced to the point of leaving virtually nothing to the imagination. But your first glimpse of the bloody skeletal head at the top of the stairs in NOTLD is the kind of image that nightmares are made of, after your imagination takes over."
"Night of the Living Dead starts on an ordinary Sunday afternoon, just like any other. Barabara (Judith O'Dea) & her Brother Johnny (co-producer Russell Streiner, uncredited) are about 200 miles outside Pittsburgh in an isolated graveyard where their dead Father is buried. While laying a reef they are attacked by one of the recently re-animated living dead (S. William Hinzman), Johnny is killed but Barbara manages to escape to a nearby farmhouse. There she meets Ben (Duane Jones) whose truck has run out of gas, together they fight off a few zombies & begin to board the farmhouse windows & doors up. They are not the only people seeking safety & shelter however, in the basement Harry (Karl Hardman), his wife Helen Cooper (Marilyn Eastman) & their ill daughter Karen (Kyra Schon) plus two teenage lovers Tom (Keith Wayne) & Judy (Judith Ridley) are also hiding from the ever growing hordes of the undead outside. They must work together to try & escape the constantly growing in number flesh-eating zombies that surround the farmhouse & seem determined to get in...Co-edited, photographed, co-written & directed by George A. Romero who also has a small cameo Night of the Living Dead was the first film in Romero's fantastic series of zombie films with Dawn of the Dead (1978) following, then came Day of the Dead (1985) & more recently Land of the Dead (2005) & is an absolute classic that every horror fan should see at least once. The script by Romero & John A. Russo works very well, even today. It moves along at a nice pace & never becomes dull or boring. I liked the fact that Night of the Living Dead features real people trying to survive & not concentrating on phony Government bodies & authorities, the character's are both believable & well balanced. I like the idea of them being real people with real fears. The farmhouse makes for a great isolated location & the film builds up well as more & more zombies swarm over the house & we lean as the character's learn through news broadcasts although the exact cause for the dead to rise is somewhat vague & isn't touched upon or explored in great depth which wasn't a problem for me at all, in fact I'd have probably preferred it if no solid explanation was given at all. With a supposed budget of around $114,000 Night of the Living dead is a bit wobbly around the edges but is technically fine, as long as you don't expect the production values of a massive Hollywood blockbuster which unfortunately I imagine most people do these days. The black and white cinematography is acceptable & works in the films favour, continuity isn't too bad, director Romero manages to create some great scenes that will forever live on in horror film history like the opening in the cemetery & the terrific downbeat ending that works perfectly, the music is non-discript & bland but expected considering it's mostly free stock music & the special effects are decent as well with a dead body that has lost it's face, some rotting zombies, some gunshot wounds & we even get some cannibalism & intestine eating. The acting is OK & about as good as one would expect, no-ones going to win any awards but then again no-one embarrasses themselves too much. Night of the Living Dead is a classic, it has stood the test of time very well & makes for an entertaining watch even now. Definitely worth watching, recommended. The remake Night of the Living Dead (1990) is also a very fine film as well."
"I found this little jewel in a used video store for about $2. The story is about (spoilers) several people who are trapped in a farmhouse that is surrounded by carnivorous walking corpses. It is revailed that the corpses were brought back to life by radiation from a satelite falling to Earth from Venus. It is suspensful, scary, and the creepy. The special effects are dated. But it is muchhhhh better than any slasher i've ever seen. The farmhouse location was great. The fight scenes looked rather lame, but the fact that guns DID SOMETHING made it still more enjoyable. You will never guess the ending in a million years."
"Director/co-writer George Romero and co-writer John Russo bring a fierce and subversive undiluted nihilism to the basic formula horror premise of the dead coming back to life as hideous flesh-eating ghouls that's lost none of its sting throughout the decades: Whether it's a couple of loved ones returning as lethal zombies so they can kill their own mother or sister or the noble Ben (a fine and commanding performance by Duane Jones) being shot dead with a bullet to the head after he's mistaken for a zombie by a posse of trigger-happy rednecks, this film pulls zero punches. Romero and Russo tackle head on major issues that remain timely and topical even today: The unreliability of the clueless media, the danger posed by average citizens having easy access to firearms, people failing to put their differences aside in order to work together so they can survive a perilous situation, and society starting to come apart at the seams when faced with a baffling problem that it's patently unprepared for and hence unable to properly deal with. In a movie rich with dark and delicious ironies, one of the richest and mot biting ironies of all is that the idea proposed by the selfish and cowardly Harry Cooper (well played to the slimy and sniveling hilt by Karl Hardman) to hole up in the basement is much better than Ben's insistence on remaining upstairs. Wholly deserving of its classic status."
"Brother and sister Johnny and Barbra are visiting their father's grave in a remote cemetery when suddenly they are attacked by zombies. Barbra finds refuge in a farmhouse, along with some other people...The movie that started the zombie-horror genre. Looks dated now, because its format has been copied so many times. Looks fairly amateurish, though that's the idea.Plot is pretty standard, but the rough-and-ready cinematography creates the atmosphere and the realistic feeling.Acting is mostly pretty poor, but, then again, these are no-name actors, often in their first movie."
"its hard to feel afraid of classic horror films because of modern society where everyone is so desensitized, but i could watch a clip of zombies having a tea party and still be uncomfortable. Night of the Living Dead still provides that sense of discomfort, but i was too distracted by how weak Barbra was portrayed. her character annoyed me. i get it, she was in shock and i'd probably be really upset too if i saw a dead guy kill my brother (if i had one), but im under the impression that most people would fight to stay alive and be alert in a situation like this. she couldn't even handle simple instructions or questions. Harry also bothered me... i cant understand how people can be so selfish and cowardly. i would understand if he was thinking of his family, but he was only thinking of himself and his own safety. and really, the risk was minimal because clearly the living were more adept than the zombies. the nature of the characters, even though i disliked them, enhances the movie because throughout the film, there was always something that was less than optimal if one was under attack by zombies."
"I didn't see much mention of this version of ""NOTLD"" so I'm posting this for anyone who might come across it and be interested.In 1998 a ""New"" version of ""NOTLD"" was created and released. Of course such releases have become common practice lately, dating back to ""Close Encounters"" in the early 80's and the complete re-thinking of the most recent ""Exorcist"" film. But in this case, rather than uncovering new ""never before seen footage"" as most expanded editions do, this version promised new footage conceived and shot by the original author of the screenplay, John Russo, and a new score in full stereo.I'm not a big fan of revisionist film-making--if the changes are noticeable it affects the experience of the movie, if they're not, then why bother? But I don't have a problem with messing with a movie as an alternative experience, like the ""green zombie"" colorized version of ""NOTLD""--if the original was that good (example: the original Star Wars) there's not much you could do to it that will erase that success. The changes to the original re-released films like ""The Abyss"" and ""Terminator 2"" didn't really affect the overall experience much, they were more or less like ""extended mixes"" of a pop song rather than ""re-mixes."" Less is more, but if you're a fan more can be a fun alternative.Here, the case is different, a serious ""re-thinking"" of a revered and classic (albeit low-budget) film. It's obvious that the motivating factor behind such an unusual move (was there really something ""missing"" from the movie originally?) must be money--yet to read the accompanying materials with the DVD package certainly makes a case that the new concept was done with a lot of love. In other words, it worked well on paper and appeals to the curious film fan, certainly.Then, of course, you watch the damn movie, and understand--within 30 seconds you realize the concept wasn't viable, at least not with the budget and talent gathered for this project.I'm glad I saw it, I'll say that, because I'm a fan of film both good and bad, especially THIS film which was already good and bad, and sometimes seeing something truly terrible teaches more about how a good movie is created than seeing a ""revered classic"" that is flawless. The 30th Anniversary edition of ""NOTLD"" points out several things that are wrong with movies today, and movies in general: 1)over-foleying of sound f/x. I know it keeps foley artist's employed, and the technology is there,but we don't really need to hear ants hiccup, the way movies are today. 2)Always use real actors, no matter what your budget. The use of the new soundtrack composer in a pivotal role was a serious error: he looks like the uglier brother of Edward Norton in ""American History X"" and can't act. 3) A soundtrack shouldn't stand out. Here, the new music sounds like little more than demo patterns on a cheap Casio keyboard someone left running. Simple themes repeat over and over until you want to cry out ""Uncle,"" or turn the power off, and the composer, with due respect, needs to learn that soundtrack music shouldn't be ""songs,"" but atmosphere. The effect here is of watching a silent film with your stereo playing in the background. The bursts of the original score only highlight how miscalculated the new score is. 4)Showing is better than telling. It was scarier when we didn't know the history of the first zombie we see, or even that he was a zombie at all, and it's redundant to show zombies eating flesh so early in the film, while the radio broadcast is informing us that people are being cannibalized. It's no longer scary, it's dull, and this movie was dull enough already--if it was going to be re-thought, care should have been taken to improve the dull ""talky"" moments in between zombie attacks.In the final analysis, this ""new"" version (that's several years old now) has a couple of moments of good gore and make-up, but nothing worth checking out. The music is obnoxious, obtrusive and cheap, as well as the new scenes which do not in any way fit in with the old ones. And the new ""slant"" that the book-end scenes with the preacher give to the film push the ""When hell is full the dead will walk the earth"" theory over the ""radiation created the zombies"" theory. It's a whole other movie, and not one I'm interested in. I never cared why the zombies were around in the first place and adding ""God's judgment"" into the mix ruins the ""fun,"" frankly.This ""new"" version has probably been forgotten already, and that's a good thing, but for some reason I still give the creators a nod of respect for trying something different, even if they failed miserably."
"Summary: The dead come back to life and try to eat the living. A few people hold up in a farmhouse and try to fight off the incoming zombies.Review: This is the first real zombie movie made. It started off a new genre and inspired many follow-ups. The script and directing is good, so is the editing. One has to wonder how much Romero really contributed to this film, as all the movies he made after this were crap. Probably John Russo had more to do with it than Romero. Acting is decent enough, typical for the early 60s. The whole movie is great, seeing a zombie apocalypse in the America of the 60s really is fun. Special effects are good. A must-see for any zombie fan! Oh yes, and THANK YOU BEN for punching Barbra in the face! I sit through any number of Horror flicks just WAITING for someone to shut up those annoying screaming women. Finally someone did! Thank you, you are my hero!Highlight: The whole movieNotable Actors: NoneGore Level: 2/5"
"I have never particularly enjoyed NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, as it's not a genre that I particularly care for--after all, if you've seen one brain-eating zombie film, you've seen them all. However, I strongly commend this film for helping to create the genre as well as getting one of the best examples of an inexpensively produced and excellent film that made a fortune (some others being CARNIVAL OF SOULS and the original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS). Now I won't go so far as to give the movie a hugely inflated rating like some, after all the acting was at times pretty shabby (particularly by that stupid blonde). But it did have a simple but clever script, good special effects given the budget and time in which it was made, decent direction and scared the crap out of audiences--something many horror films fail to do. If you love the genre, then this is a must. Otherwise, it's not a must-see unless you are making a study of excellent bare-bones film making."
"First of all; the zombies are not scary!The movie ""Psycho"" is from 1960. Eight years later in 1968, ""Night of the Living Dead"" was made. In spite of these eight years this movie is nothing compared to ""Psycho"". You could even believe ""Night of the Living Dead"" was made eight years before ""Psycho""!It may seem like I'm a big ""Psycho""-fan, but I'm not. It's just that ""Night of the Living Dead"" is not such a great movie!"
"The siblings Johnny and Barbra, drive to a rural and distant cemetery to place a wreath on their father's grave. When they are there, a very strange pale-faced man lumbers toward Barbra, trying to grab her, but her brother Johnny, in an attempt to save her, falls and smashes his head on a gravestone. Worried but terrorized, Barbra runs away to an abandoned house where she stays hidden from the zombies, and soon is joined by Ben and other humans. They all doesn't understand why suddenly so many strange people, looking dead creatures, are attacking them, until they discover by the radio that those people are infected and their only purpose is to kill humans to have their own meal...Ps:I don't personally find ''Night of the Living Dead '' a scary movie, but I can understand it's importance, since it was the first zombie movie created, as well as how George Romero, the director, is considered to be one of the classical horror directors of all times. I find the character Barbra totally annoying, but I can understand that besides terrified, she is traumatized by her brother's death. The women from that time were also considered to be fragile, so you can see clearly that the women from this movie have few participations in helping the men or killing monsters."
"George Romero's cult horror classic. The film quality is poor and the acting is totally amateurish so this film should have been a failure. But it isn't. It's a low budget shocker dealing with the dead coming back to life to roam the countryside as cannibalistic zombies. When it was released it was considered the most shocking horror movie ever made, the cutting edge of bad taste and gore. It may be tame by today's horror movie standards, but it's still fun and paved the way for a host of sequels, zombie films, remakes and pale imitations. The grainy black and white photography gives a documentary feel to the film. Romero made three sequels: Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, and recently Land of the Dead. None of them are as good as this first film."
"I've seen ""Night of the Living Dead"" a couple of times by now and I believe that this movie, historically important as it - undoubtedly - is, doesn't hold up very well. Two major reasons:1) It's technically dated. While the b/w cinematography is excellent and the zombies look quite convincing, the ""nervous"" editing style often looks clumsy and inept.2) There are some huge lulls. All those radio and TV bulletins, which are supposed to be ""enlightening"" and explain what's going on, actually interrupt the action boringly. Watching the heroes watching TV for about 10 minutes isn't that interesting.There are some chilling moments in this film, and the pessimistic finale is ironic and brilliant, but the film as a whole just isn't as effective as it (probably) was during its first release. Another person here mentioned that it's also kind of a homage to ""The Birds"". I agree, but even with a higher budget, this film would still be far inferior to that amazing Hitchcock classic."
"A movie worth seeing, but not the classic it's made out to be. Apart from the first and last ten minutes, it's absolutely boring. To kick things off, you have that brilliant hurry-up-and-start-the-car scene that's appeared in practically every horror movie since. To end things you have the mother/daughter death by (well, I won't say) scene, and the cruel, cruel ending. But for an hour between it's just a lot of people standing in a house arguing about what they're going to do when the zombies come in. Which would be fine if there was any suspense or urgency about it, but the zombies seem to make absolutely no attempt to enter the house anyway. Until they sense that it's nearly the end of the movie or something. The 'space radiation' explanation sucks somewhat too. It's a bad idea to make the explanation more ludicrous than the thing it's meant to explain."
"I was duly impressed that a film made for $114,000 could gross something like $12 million, but then--as the old saying goes--never underestimate the bad taste of the public. And that about sums up what I think of this film's impact on the horror genre.The dead come back to haunt the living. How they come back is one of those science fiction theories that lacks real plausibility but that didn't stop the screenwriter from concocting this tale of impending doom. There's a film noir quality to the low-key lighting effects as the main characters huddle inside a house that's been boarded up to prevent the carnivorous zombie-like creatures from devouring them.If you get your thrills from seeing flesh-eating zombies, this is for you. Not only is the gore rather explicit, but close-ups of hungry zombies smacking their lips over a meal is what makes this the sort of exploitation film Hitchcock tried to stay away from. He got his effects with a bit more wit and wisdom.For a low-budget thriller, the performances are about what you'd expect. DUANE JONES, as Ben, is the hero of the tale and he does give the best performance in the film, which is not saying too much. It's the script that could have used some refinement with dialog that's enough to give you a few chuckles before the tale reaches an unsatisfying and rather abrupt ending."
"Night of the Living Dead (1968) was the one that spawned several sequels (some official others not) and hundreds of knock-offs. The movie takes place in the Pittsburgh countryside. Innocently enough a brother and sister are visiting their father's grave site when they encounter a strange individual. He attacks and kills the brother whilst the sister flees the scene. She stumbles into a country farm house that will later become a house of horrors. Meanwhile a young black man seeks safety inside the house and tries to make it into a refugee from the chaos and death that's follows him. Awesome horror flick. This has to be one of my favorite horror films of all time and the best movie franchise. Often imitated but it's never quite exactly duplicated or replicated. George A. Romero and company came across something big and it changed the face of horror forever! Followed by two darker sequels and an excellent remake. Black and white hasn't felt so creepy since Nosferatu!Highly recommended! One of the essentials.Followed by: Dawn of the Dead Day of the Dead Check out Last Man on Earth, it's the original Night of the Living Dead and it's just as good. But I have to give the nod towards N.O.T.L.D. George A. Romero is the man!"
"No one will believe me when I tell them that this is the first time I saw Night Of The Living Dead. I'm in the genre from the eighties but as you might know, I'm not into 50's and 60's flicks. And this one shows me again why. I agree that it was the first flick that started it all but face it, where's the gore. zombie flicks are know for their gore and here most bites are done off-screen. The zombies itself looks really well for the time being but still it's all a lot of talking. If you look at Dawn or Day then that's something different. the red stuff flows and the gore is there. naturally it wasn't really done to show gore but look at Blood Feast. It did contain the red stuff and the gore and don't get me wrong. A good horror doesn't need blood, look at Halloween or Texas Chainsaw. No drip is included. It is one that you must have in your collection to have all the 'of the dead' titles but for me, too much talking and didn't deliver any frightening moments, maybe the zombiechild in the cellar but still...Of course it's famous as the first zombie flick were zombies really walk and don't wander around, S. William Hinzman did set a new thing towards the zombie flicks. He will always be the name as first walking zombie just for his face alone, a thing George noticed as he was in the crew and not as an actor in this flick. The rest is history. Naturally the part that the black guy survives is also not done in a racist country in the sixties. A classic.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
"This thing may have been made is the late 60's,but it hasn't really lost any of its charm. It's something between a drama about people who can't seem to live with each other in a decent matter, and then suddenly hey, flesh-eating corpses. Romero somehow kept the indoor scenes interesting though there isn't really much happening. Just people bickering. Although the ending is kind of a shocker, it was in fact kind of appropriate to indicate the madness. I wasn't too happy about it upon seeing it though. This movie was really influential, but the only zombie movie that could really achieve this level was the follow-up ""Dawn Of The Dead"". All the rest just has that feel that it would never exist without Romero, and that it has its best visual ideas from this one. I could call it a masterpiece."
"This great word of mouth horror flick kick started a career for writer/director George A. Romero. Shot crudely in black and white, with the impression the budget was not much more than a shoe string. Quickly this film reached cult following and is a great movie to watch in a party gathering. One third of the east coast is terrorized by the recently deceased and these slow stumbling zombies crave human flesh. The earliest form of defense is to shoot and then burn. After all; bras, draft cards, flags...almost everything was targets of the torch in the late 60s. A group of people think that they have found safety in a farm house near a cemetery. Hammers, nails, shotguns, kerosene and fruit jar cocktails barely slows down the ghoulish carnage.Playing in this underestimated classic are: Duane Jones, Keith Wayne, Judith Ridley, Marilyn Eastman and Judith O'Dea."
"I'm a huge horror fan and waited so long to see this film, supposedly one of the best horror films ever made, which was the biggest let down ever. The majority of the characters are pathetic in almost every sense, was I the only person who really just wanted to smack Barbara? The only good part was when the girl Killed her parents, I was rooting for her to dispose of the rest of them. Admitted the film was probably ahead of its time and was a first for many, but like the Exorcist and Blair Witch, why does it scare people? Why did people run from cinemas screaming their heads off, really do some people really have no life?, can't they make the distinction between film and reality?"
"It might seem a bit unfair that I already knew what was going to happen in the movie. In movies like this, it shows what would really happen. It picks one group out of the whole. This is a rare thing-a movie truly deserving respect. For some strange reason, I found the movie really, really, weirdly disturbing. The films today, looking to exploit youthful audiences, are far more violent than this film. But for some reason, I found it even scarier than those movies. Maybe it's the black-and-white. Or the indiscriminatingly violent deaths. Or maybe seeing burned corpses picked apart and eaten just really turns my stomach...Yep, I'm pretty sure it's answer C. Though you might not realize it while you're watching, 'Night of the Living Dead' is truly frightening. Though it was made on a low-budget with unknowns, it has some terrific acting and directing. I don't think I'll watch it again. I found it fantastically well-made, but not ""enjoyable"" in the sense of the word. Though it was made in 1968, it's guaranteed to create nausea in everyone.9 charred corpses out of 10."
"Only fans of the horror genre could tolerate this movie. From a lousy script, bad acting, cornball dialogue, and cheesy affects, this film causes one to want the time back he wasted viewing it. Stupid moments litter the script, from the obvious to downright awkward. To add ultimate insult to the injury, the ending is what ultimately burns this dead horse. If scenes of the dead don't turn one's stomach, it'll be other elements of the production. Though horror films don't tend to have the best performances, this flick is an embarrassment to them all just the same. How gifted director/screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan possibly found ""inspiration"" from this film is a complete crock. There are better horror movies out there. This flick isn't one of them."
"Still as great as it always has been. It is much of the basis for many horror movies today. However, there are still flaws.Judith O'Dea (Barbara) overacts the whole time. She is extremely overdramatic and it is very distracting to watch. Cheesy as hell. She is also incredibly useless which gets very frustrating.Competent intelligent black lead is a great start, but damn they couldve made the leading woman capable of logic and thought and not just falling all over the place moaning and crying.Still one of the best ever though."
"This movie shouldn't be as watchable as it is. You look up and you're an hour into it. Romero and company hit a homerun with their first at bat. The gross out stuff is not as gross as it used to be. In fact, it almost seems like a distraction now. Repeated viewing may have dulled the shocks for me but not the enjoyment...I'm old enough to remember when Living Dead aired on broadcast television the tv stations would put words on the screen during the news reports. They wanted the audience to understand it was not a real newscast and that it was just a movie."
"Honestly I can handle many black and white films well but this astounded me! Barbara and her brother go down to a grave site very far from where they had came when it all happened and that's when thongs go downhill.
This film really had good effects for a indie film and shaped our world on what we call zombies.
A 7/10 for great effects, acting, and the story which kept me watching."
"Compared to most horror films these days, Night of the Living Dead is quite primeval. But that's not to say that it is bad - Primitive Technology on YouTube has shown me time and time again that early man was brilliant. And in a way it was refreshing to take a break from overdone gore and overacting. Well, overacting is still here. The plot is pretty simple by today's standards too. A couple of people, led by a Mr. Ben (Duane Jones) attempt to survive against a wave of zombies while trying hard not to attack each other first. And more than 90% of the movie takes place inside the same house which they barricade and raid for supplies. As far as the simple plot goes, I feel they do it justice, and it is supplemented by the interesting to watch power struggle between Ben and Mr. Cooper (Karl Hardman) and the racial undertones that the movie infers. But aside from the inherent fun this movie offers, about halfway through, the movie becomes a little repetitive. Even though new characters are introduced, the tone feels quite samey for the entire middle leg. It's not until the run where Tom (Keith Wayne), Judy (Judith Ridley), and Ben run out where things get moving again. Perhaps I am just accustomed to today's thrillers which keep up at a breakneck pace for the entire runtime, but it felt not too much was happening during that period. Overall, I think it a successful and worthy grandfather of modern horror."
"Night of the Living Dead owns its reputation as one of the most important horror films ever made. Most modern horror films go intensely overboard on both the gore and the pace, while forgetting to include any actual drama for characters to face. George A Romero proved with this film, almost fifty years ago, that he knows how to scare an audience, and really make them think."
"If ever the term ""classic"" seemed more appropriate then Night of the Living Dead is the perfect example of what classic really means. A film laced with fear, dread, social commentary and layered with atmosphere so thick it could smother the air.Night of the Living Dead follows Barbara as on a trip to her father's grave she and her brother are attacked by a listless person who seems to move awkwardly and destroys everything in its path. Eventually she holes up in a farmhouse with other survivors including Ben as they work together to survive the terrifying events surrounding them. Whether you like this film or not does not diminish the fact that this rightly deserves its place in history as one of the finest zombie (or ghoul depending on your preference) films there is.The pace is admirably quick: from the beginning with Barbra and Johnny at the graveyard, the ghoul/ zombie it sets a consistent pace that grips the audience and keeps you hooked. The acting is decent, though Judith O'Dea does, to a degree, let it down slightly with a character that's just too emotionally wrought to oftentimes care about. But where she lacks Duane Jones compensates entirely with a performance of outstanding brilliance. The quiet intelligence of his character; how he thinks through many of scenarios placed before them - Jones is a joy to watch time and again. The ghouls/ zombies look fantastic and act it too; the shambolic way in which they move, the slow pace that persists, they feel and come across as genuinely terrifying.And it must be said that the small trace of a score is beautiful. When it's not present we hear the smooth notes of birds whistling on high, the natural sounds proving as unnerving as the gentle strum of notes in the background that precipitate the altogether disturbing sequences especially that cellar scene!Maybe it's talked about too often but I can't mention NOTLD without discussing that end! Even to this day it leaves an hollow emptiness in the stomach at what happens to Ben and the impact it courts upon the viewer never quite fades - yet despite my desire for a semi happy ending I have to concede it needed this dark, bleak ending to leave that impression. If you love horror and haven't yet seen this, do so, it's one that I feel is mandatory viewing. So turn off the phone/ computer/ laptop, put down the shades and embrace Romero's outstanding low budget film."
"It's shocking that this was a micro-budget directorial debut, as it really is just top-notch movie-making in every way. The script is great, with penetrating themes, & characters that are so well-drawn. The direction is confident & artistic. The largely improvised dialogue is so full of great quotes (""They're coming to get you, Barbara"" ""Yeah, they're dead. They'reall messed up."") But mostly, it's just classically disturbing, scary, and tense horror in the truest sense."
"This is my #1 favorite horror film of all time. It is the only movie to ever give me nightmares. I started getting them as a teenager, put into the same situation as the film – one among a small band of people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, surrounded by an increasing number of the living dead.Aside from the nightmares, this is my #1 horror movie because it creates an atmosphere of absolute dread – something that I appreciate in a movie (thus my screen name AnDread). The protagonists face what seems to be a pretty much hopeless situation, surrounded by numerous antagonists who want to eat you, who can't be reasoned with, and who continue to grow in number. On top of that, they are faced with in-fighting and incompetence. Perhaps they could survive if they just learned to work together, rather than constantly argue with each other. But this is Romero's not-so-subtle point: compromise rather than dominance is the key to survival. He has said that he thought of the living dead as a revolution, a new (single- minded) generation cannibalizing the older, obsolete generation. Actually, I think of them more akin to a natural disaster – or Godzilla, a monster birthed from our own violent ways, a new creation bent on destroying everything old.The nihilistic ending still gives me chills – it's one of the bleakest movie endings ever. I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say that when I saw it for the first time as a teen, it hit me pretty hard. I had never seen any movie end like that.For such a low-budget film, Romero does a fantastic job using sound, lighting, practical effects, and performances to maximum advantage. The acting is excellent. Some may not be impressed with the way the characters are written, or the way they are portrayed. But while both are handled with a simplistic, at times seemingly melodramatic, approach, the writing is more layered than you might first think. And I think most people would agree that the performances are highly memorable. Duane Jones as Ben and Karl Hardman as Harry Cooper make this film work so well; seeing their increasing aggression and rivalry ratchets the tension to an almost unbearable degree. This dynamic is so complex that I see it a new way each time. While I've always identified with and rooted for Ben – quite a feat for an African American protagonist in 1968 – on recent viewings, I've come to realize that Ben isn't always that reasonable either. If he hadn't been so pushy and competitive with Cooper, maybe things could have turned out differently. Judith O'Dea as Barbara and Marilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper also deserve mention. Some people criticize O'Dea's performance as wooden or the way her character is written as sexist, because she's either hysterical or catatonic through much of the narrative. But I think plenty of people, men and women, would be like Barbara in a similarly horrifying situation. Although she has a minor role, Eastman as Helen is a great counterpoint to both Barbara and her husband, spitting sarcastic barbs at Harry and trying to become part of the larger group. I can't say that Keith Wayne as Tom and Judith Ridley as Judy add much, except as a counterpoint to the Coopers, a couple who tries to hang on to love during a crisis. Kyra Schon as Karen, the Coopers' daughter, George Kosana as Sheriff McClelland, and Russell Streiner as Johnny (who, according to IMDb, is uncredited for some reason), show just how memorable minor characters can be. Streiner and Kosana speak two of the most memorable lines in horror movie history – ""They're coming to get you, Barbara,"" and ""They're dead, they're all messed up."" And to many, Schon's big scene is one of the most disturbing scenes in all of horror cinema.The black and white cinematography also adds to the bleakness of the film; for me, the often washed-out look and dark lighting make the zombies more frightening than in any of the subsequent films, with skin tones of blues, greens, and grays, and bright red blood flowing. Something about watching the ghouls stumble around in the shadows, and blood pour out in dark swatches, adds a sinister air to them that doesn't quite translate to color, even in the more realistic and disgusting effects in later films.Many have already spoken eloquently about the film's social commentary and influence on later horror films, and culture generally. I'll just say that Romero and John Russo (who co-wrote the script) tapped into already existing horror elements and current social anxieties around civil unrest, clashes with authorities, and Vietnam, by creating a new genre, the flesh-eating zombie film (as opposed to the Voodoo zombie), and virtually helping to usher in a new horror aesthetic – bleaker, gorier, and more focused on gritty realism than stylized aesthetics."
"Barbara and Johnny visit their father's grave somewhere in the American countryside. When they arrive at the spooky graveyard, Johnny teases his jumpy sister: ""They're coming to get you, Barbara."" But the joke is on him, because they are really coming to get Barbara. And Johnny, too. And the hole country for that matter. A mysterious epidemic causes the dead to rise from their graves and attack the living. One of those ghouls attacks Barbara. Johnny defends her, and Barbara flees in terror. She reaches a secluded farm house and meets other people who seek shelter. Can these strangers work together in order to survive? Or are they going to destroy each other, before the ghouls even reach them?""Night of the Living Dead"" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It certainly is the best horror movie I've ever seen. That being said, it's difficult to explain why I love it so much. It is a low budget flick. There are some glaring editing mistakes and the acting is subpar most of the time. But like no other movie out there, ""Night of the Living Dead"" is able to turn its trash atmosphere into pure art. It's such a gritty and dirty experience, you feel like you need a shower afterwards. There are two main reasons why this movie is so effective: the director George A. Romero and the subtext of the screenplay.Romero didn't have much to work with, but he made it count. The scene where Barbara explores the empty farm house is exquisite. The lighting is reminiscent of German Expressionism. The awry camera settings and the contrast between light and dark are great devices to elucidate Barbara's trauma. There is a scene where Romero pans over the barricaded interior of the farm house. The intersecting planks form an abstract pattern that is strangely unsettling. You'll soon realize that this movie might be cheap, but surprisingly artful as well.""Night of the Living Dead"" was a watershed for modern horror because it was insanely gruesome for the time: There are zombies hunting people and eating the flesh of their prey. But it's not the explicit gore that makes this movie so effective. The true horror stems from the way Romero depicts these acts of violence. They come across as surreal and deviant, like you're having a sick fever dream. The subtext of this movie is incredibly rich. The screenplay tackles many unwieldy political topics - war, racism and marriage are only a few of them. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a relentless, apocalyptic nightmare that has nothing for the audience except unnerving pessimism. The ending of this movie might just be the best ending in movie history: It's poignant, courageous and subversive. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is an utterly unique, matchless horror movie. If you haven't seen it, watch it. Now. And if you already saw it, watch it again. Now."
"Everything about this movie is beyond creepy, but that's what makes it great! The story, the music and great acting by a bunch of non famous actors. I saw this on MTV Halloween night back in the early 80's, I was a young teen then. I personally think this is the greatest zombie movie of all time. I have this now on DVD, it's great because it has the black & white and colored version to choose from. This is a movie that I watch about once a year."
"Zombie horrors were made by George Romero's franchise and they were made in a proper way when it comes to directing skills. Camera on the floor, narrow angle and a fast cut created the claustrophobic atmosphere of a couple of young people besieged inside the house by the army of the dead that came back to life. The script is by all means naive, as are the special effects, but the foundations of the entire genre are well laid down, including the confusion and the brutal ending to the entire flick. If you are a zombie horror fan, The night of the living dead"" is the place where it all started."
"This low budget independent jewel of a Horror Flick I stumbled across accidentally on a late Saturday night. It was close to midnight as I felt sleepy and decided to go to bed despite the noise and chatter of my crowded house. My Parents threw a party with friends and relatives all about. My room was the furthest away despite the noise. I jumped into bed and clicked on my small Black and white TV. As the screen appeared I see a reporter wearing horn rimmed glasses in a noisy newsroom with teletype machines ringing in the background as he describes the escalating carnage of ghoulish deceased beings ravaging the cities and town of the United States. I thought it was the local news reporting this outrageous unbelievable story. I was so gullible and naive at the tender age of 12. I yelled out that the Dead have come to life put on the Television for all to see. My obnoxious Uncle Bernie says very funny oh I saw that zombie Picture last year. Then posted on the screen on top the words in white read,""A DRAMATIZATION!"" I was so embarrassed. Any way I continued watching the movie by my lonesome. The basement scenes are forever edge in my memory as you see the impossible odds stacked against the living few in the boarded up farm house in nowhere, Pennsylvania. The clock ticks ever so slowly as the dead count grows and our players are wondering if help will ever come .Duane Jones gives an outstanding performance as the protagonist. The glue that holds the group together in this terrifying situation. Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) the antagonist who insist that everyone should stay in the cellar for cover against Ben's (Duane Jones)objections to be more aggressive against these Zombies. Barbra (Judith O'Dea) was in a catatonic state throughout this film jabbering about her brother Johnny hoping he's still alive despite getting his head crushed against a tombstone. What also shocked me the most wasn't the gore so much or the violent death scenes. The Coopers sickly girl with a trowel in her grasp taking the life of her Mother was unforgettable. The appearance of Wrestling Announcer Chilly Billy Cardille. Cardille a Pittsburgh celebrity in his own right who hosted the ever popular Chiller Theater. His appearance was sort a comfort, familiar face. My eyes opened, as I thought to myself ,""there's a familiar, friendly face."" Hired by Vince McMahon Sr. President of the World Wide Wrestling federation as the voice of Wrestling in the Northeast corridor of the United States. The matches were shown on the UHF Spanish channel in New York. In the early 1970's Bill was fired. Bill was replaced, nepotism by a goofy kid with cleft chin,southern accent,bulging eyes, saddle shoes and wearing a red blazer Vince McMahon Jr. Cardille was certainly a relief in this movie despite the blood,gore and ravenous ghouls fighting to get a piece of the living flesh throughout the long night in countryside.The Ghouls ripping away the boards from the vulnerable edifice. To cut the tension in those gross scenes, writer George Romero gives us at times a rest-bud, a relief as News reporter Bill Cardille gives the Sheriff a badly needed cup of Joe. Sheer genius on the part of George Romero as his film effort was on time and way under budget. George claimed he could make a better Zombie Apocalypse movie than a professional studio. He nailed it."
"This film was reviled by mainstream critics for its unimaginable gore and violence. Those who kept a Reader's Digest next to the toilet could be informed of its nauseatingly bad taste and poor quality before skipping on to read ""I Am Joe's Liver"". Catholics perusing a copy of Our Sunday Visitor would find rated as a solid ""C"" (for condemned as objectionable for all). By no means it is for everybody, but for those who enjoy a good creepy movie it's simply superb.The settings: forlorn cemetery, empty roads, an isolated farmhouse, drab winter weather - all of these were undoubtedly chosen with the tiny budget in mind but came off as genius picks for location atmosphere.The actors: total unknowns who were probably paid a fee that wouldn't fill your gas tank today - all spot-on right for the roles.Special effects: not all that special, but that's what made them work so well. The entrails looked like the cast-off material from a boar hog castration and the extras grabbed them up and gobbled them down with relish.My favorite character: Sheriff McClelland. That guy deadpanned some of the best lines in movie history (they're all available here on IMDb).I admit to a weakness for B-movies so my standards are pretty low, but this is no B grade, it's a true cinematic gem. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out."
