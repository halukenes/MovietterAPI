"Set in a French boarding school for boys, ""Les Diaboliques"" tells the story of two teachers, Christina (played by Vera Clouzot), and Nicole (played by Simone Signoret), who conspire to kill the sadistic headmaster, a man who also happens to be Christina's abusive husband.Like most murder mysteries, the story is highly improbable; nevertheless, the film is still hugely entertaining, thanks in part to plot twists and turns that even Agatha Christie would admire, and to the film's B&W lighting, that renders a noirish, sinister atmosphere.The first half is interesting and tightly plotted. But the real strength of the film's underlying premise begins at the mid-point plot turn. The second half is riveting, because the tight plot begins to ooze with mystery and suspense. It builds to a final ten minutes that are as frightening as almost any ending in film history; dark interiors, shadows, ominous light at the end of a long hallway, a general absence of sound, a gloved hand, a scream, and an unexpected image. It's the very definition of spine-tingling suspense.There is a clue to help solve the story's mystery in the film's first ten minutes; but like any good mystery, that clue is very subtle. All the film's acting is excellent, even down to the children actors. And, Simone Signoret is as wonderful here as she is in all of her other movies.English subtitles require a little more work for viewers who cannot understand the French dialogue; yet, the story, the acting, and the cinematography should more than offset this minor irritation. Background music occurs only during the film's title sequence and closing credits; this general absence of music thus enhances suspense.Although not strictly speaking a whodunit, ""Les Diaboliques"" is a classic murder mystery that has earned a well-deserved reputation for setting the standard for cinematic suspense. The story is riveting, and the film is technically well made. More recent films have tried to copy it; but this is the original."
"Are you alone? good. Have you turned off the lights? good.Is there a storm brewing in that dark foreboding sky?Excellent. Do you like brilliant black and white movies? Wonderful.Now, sit back and enjoy the best of the best. This is quite simply the best psychological thriller ever made.Often imitated but never bettered. If you have a problem with subtitled films then don't worry because you will understand this film without reading them. If you want slash and gore, go elsewhere.If you want sophisticated entertainment,you've come to the right place.Georges Cluzot's finest work is a thing of beauty as is his wife Vera, who stars opposite Simone Signoret as the schoolmaster's wife.From the very start it is very clear that all is not as it seems. But why? and who? What is the terrible secret of the swimming pool and later on, the bathtub? As the tension builds to an unbearable climax, we sit and hide behind our hands, peering through the gaps in our fingers.Oh my God!! it can't be!.....it is! Do not confuse this movie with the disgraceful remake starring Sharon Stone. All copies of that disaster should be burned. Watch this movie if you are a serious film buff. Rent something else if you have the attention span of a goldfish.Brilliant. 10/10"
"Les Diaboliques is one of the tightest, pure suspense movies I have ever seen.  The story starts out slowly, but as it moves on, peculiar things start to happen.    This movie keeps you guessing in such a way, you are riveted to your seat, hoping for a quick resolution to the suspense.  Yet, as the story unfolds, the suspense deepens.  The final scene of the movie had me sitting back holding my breath.This movie does not offer cheap, pop out and scare you tactics. Rather, it makes the viewer expect things to happen that don't.  You wait on the edge of your seat for the quick jump out and scare you event to take place, but instead, it sneaks up from behind you.  What an effect!Les Diaboliques is a classic film that delivers the complete suspense package.  It's not surprising that many suspense movies of the modern era have tried to copy the plot.  This movie is well worth renting in a video store, if you can find it."
"""Les Diaboliques"" has one of the best plots you will ever find in any mystery or suspense thriller.  The excellent directing, acting, and writing combine with the story itself to make it a memorable experience.If you enjoy quality mysteries or thrillers, you will almost certainly enjoy this one - and if you have not seen it yet, you might just want to buy or rent it now, before you read any more reviews.  This comment will avoid any discussion at all of the actual plot itself, because the less you know in advance, the more you will enjoy it.  The few implausible elements in the story do not detract at all from the enjoyment.A great plot does not all by itself make a good movie, and everything works especially well here because of the expert pacing by director Henri-Georges Clouzot and good, mostly understated acting by the main actors.  We are drawn into their world very nicely.  Everything about the characters and events is built up perfectly, to give the brilliant climax its full effect. Once again, see it before you find out any more.Even if you do not normally watch black-and-white films or foreign movies (this is in French), if you enjoy thrillers, watch ""Les Diaboliques"" as soon as you have the chance."
"Hitchcock must have forever wondered how he managed to allow this story to slip out of his hands, but the fact remains: had he filmed CELLE QUI N'ETAIT PAS into his own version of what is known as LES DIABOLIQUES, there very well might not have been a VERTIGO, also an adaptation from the authors of the aforementioned one and D'ENTRE LES MORTES. All in all, this is an excellent horror film that has strong Film Noir overtones and precedes New Wave by a couple of years and its simple yet powerful direction by Jean Georges-Clouzot elevates it from a standard thriller to one to which all others are measured spawning countless imitations with much less satisfying degree. One wonders what treatment Hitchcock would have given it, and interestingly, it's all here: the almost casual presentation of spousal abuse that occurs off-camera in one chilling scene early on, the events that lead the women (Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret) to make a drastic decision concerning killing Clouzot's husband (Michel DelaSalle), and then the growing, deadly certainty he may not be quite dead after all... and may be after the terrified women. The last 15 minutes are one of the most tension-inducing I've ever seen in any climactic montage (even if it does veer into a certain implausibility but the intent is to tell a suspense story and Hitchcock has often mentioned the ""suspension of disbelief"" factor) and have long gone into history as one of the most horrific moments in cinema.To those interested in watching LES DIABOLIQUES, please do NOT watch its American remake, DIABOLIQUE, with Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. It pays to read the subtitles in this film."
"DIABOLIQUE (Henri-Georges Clouzot - France 1955). I must admit I found Clouzot's earlier WAGES OF FEAR(1953) slightly disappointing and therefor temporarily held back from watching any other films he made but how wrong I was! This much discussed classic was one of the most frightening and disturbing films I've ever seen. The music theme played during the opening credits with the organ and the singing schoolchildren still makes the hairs in my neck stand up, even at this very moment.The story revolves around the tyrant schoolmaster Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) of a seedy boarding school, his wife (Vera Clouzot) and his mistress (Simone Signoret). An he maltreats them both, they decide to work together to murder him. They drown Delasalle in the bathtub and dump the corpse in the abandoned swimming pool next to the school. But then, eerie things start to happen. When the pool is drained and no body is found, the two women grow increasingly fearful that Delasalle is still alive. When subsequently his suit is returned from the dry-cleaners and the schoolchildren repeatedly testify they've seen Delasalle, they start to panic and the strange occurrences surrounding his supposed resurrection slowly drive them into insanity and complete paranoia.Justifiably hailed as one of the most suspenseful films ever made and often compared to Hitchcock's work. Clouzot lacks the master's wit but as far as suspense goes, he is incomparable. Very much opposed to Hitchcock, this film - like most of his work - has a very cynical and misanthropic feel to it. Perhaps largely due to this very dark tone and Clouzot's excellent eye for detail, even today it still has the power to drive you right up the wall. And Simone Signoret, whom I've never (consciously) seen before in other films, greatly added to my admiration of this film. A sublime actress and an absolutely hypnotizing screen presence. The entire cast is terrific for that matter with Charles Vanel as inspector Fichet another standout.Clouzot takes his time to build up the story very precisely but once the mysterious things start to happen every scene adds to an almost unbearable tension. You'll watch every facial expression and every detail on screen with increasing paranoia yourself, in order to understand what on earth could have happened. And the ending is so surprising that I wasn't quite sure anymore about the things I just saw, even right after the film's ending. A genuinely great movie that more than lives up to its status and has lost none of its impact over the last five decades.Camera Obscura --- 10/10"
"This is not a legend : after reading Pierre Boileau's novel, Alfred Hitchcock phone the editor in the morning to buy the story for making a film. But another great master, Henri-Georges Clouzot, had phone 30 minutes earlier. Mister Hitchcock was angry! But Hitch couldn't have done better than Clouzot. This is P-E-R-F-E-C-T! The black and white, the dialogues, the acting and even the reclusive French scool of the 1950's. And for the suspense... well every viewer of IMDB had said the same things I could said. So, Diaboliques is the best suspense thriller of all time, and also one of the best movie ever made. Please, I really said please, don't ever watch the remake with Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone. There are certains movies that you can't make two times. Like all the Hitchcock and Clouzot films, for example..."
"Another terrific suspense film from Henri-Georges Clouzot, Les Diaboliques (also known as ""Diabolique"") is a tense story of murder, suspicion and revenge. The plot revolves around two women, Christina (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole (Simone Signoret) who conspire to murder the brutish man who is Christina's husband and Nicole's lover Michel, played by the delightfully sullen Paul Meurisse. He is the principal of a boarding school for boys who relies on Vera's money to support his excesses, and the two women are both teachers at the school.Vera has her doubts about committing murder, even though Michel is incredibly abusive. But Nicole convinces her to help drug and then drown Michel. All seems to be going well until Michels body goes missing and the two women turn against each other. The situation is complicated further by the appearance of a retired police inspector who is determined to help Vera find her ""missing"" husband, despite the poor woman's protests. The tension continues to mount until the hair-raising climax.This movie is on a par with some of Hitchcock's best work, although Clouzot doesn't mix much humor in with the suspense, as Hitch often did. However, Vera's interaction with the droll inspector does provides some chuckles. Unlike his previous film, The Wages Of Fear, Clouzot doesn't spend a whole lot of time on the set-up of the plot, but gets right to the meat of the matter, and from there Diabolique rolls along very quickly with barely a letup in the action.I can't believe it took me so long to see this masterpiece. Highly recommended."
"Scare the crap out of you! I don't hand out many 10s. Some movies don't really require much thought or analysis. In the end all that matters is what happened to you when you first saw it.I remember when I first saw this. Nothing scary at first, but the nastiness of the place and the people is effortlessly shown. And then the bad stuff starts to happen.Ugliness...shock...suspense...shock...mystery...eeriness...awful shock.I remember, though it must have been forty years ago, the climactic scenes with my neck hairs standing up, sweat on my face, clutching the theater armrests like I was in danger of falling, and finally realizing I was weeping- not tears of sadness, tears of helpless terror.I envy anyone seeing this for the first time."
"Clouzot is possibly the cinema's most devout pessimist: no other director has portrayed human vices so persuasively If his bitter vision of the world is finally limited and unattractive, his status as a major filmmaker, entertaining through suspense while simultaneously expressing his private dismay with cool and detached visual precision, remains intact ""Les Diaboliques"" is a mystery set in a shabby boys' boarding school The plot  a sadistic headmaster is murdered by his wife and his mistress; ominously and inexplicably, his corpse vanishes is too contrived to survive repeated viewings, but the stark gray images emphasizing physical decay offer a precise, grimly poetic visual correlative for the characters' warped emotionsClouzot's moral pessimism, shock tactics and readiness to display man's worst excesses suggest parallels with Hitchcock and Fuller, while his focus on cruelty, domination and decay may be compared with that of figures as diverse as Leone, Blier and Fassbinder"
"Les diaboliques is an unusually intense movie. I believe this is due to the well thought out choice of real locations and the masterful use of spatial entities and textures. Your memory really gets hooked on those things, and it gives the story a sense of reality that makes you feel uneasy.
Les diaboliques is as much a horror movie as it is a thriller. When I watch this I perceive an intense mouldy smell throughout. The crumbling boarding school where the main characters live and act is worse than any nightmare  even the swimming pool filled with murky water appears like a menacing abyss. The stifling crummyness is accentuated by the plot: School teachers sit at the sadistic principal's table in the refectory and have to force unspeakably ghastly meals down their throats (only one glass of wine is allowed). The second location is the principal's lover's apartment in a dead borough somewhere in no man's land. It's stuffy and utterly claustrophobic. The transfer between the two places is made with a ""deux chevaux"" station wagon  its characteristic back part of corrugated sheet metal once was a common feature in our parts of the world, as was the snarling sound of the deux chevauxs engine. In the corrugated iron ""box"" sits a creaky wicker crate, which on the way back from the lover's apartment contains evidence of the crime, wrapped in a checkered wax tablecloth. So you see shells within shells, not unlike one of those Russian wooden dolls. You don't know what you will find in the innermost until the end."
"Director Henri Georges Clouzot must not have had a sunny disposition.  This movie is painful to watch, the angst-ridden actors bite and hack  each other to bloody pieces, and the camera contemplates the action  like a vulture, waiting for raw carcasses to dismember. All this,  without really showing any violence. It's all in the mind.  Les Diaboliques is shot in black and white, but as I remember it, it  was all murky grey. Maybe it was just the worn-out print, maybe it was  intentional, but it really worked on me. Like the constant drizzle of  October rain, the dirty, bedraggled schoolchildren, the delapidated  buildings, the rotten school-lunches! I felt deeply suicidal!  The movie is full of scary scenes, of something unspeakably bad waiting  to happen to the ""murderesses"". The long-awaited bathroom climax is not  the most scary part, yet it is a welcome release for all the pent-up  emotion, and Vera Clouzot truly appears to be near death. Her features  twisted and tortured,her expressive body wretched and thin like a  concentration-camp prisoner. She looks to be in real pain.  Les Diaboliques means The Devilish, and the Devil is clearly at work  here. I have seldom felt a stronger presence of evil, and Clouzot  manages this feat without a single concession to the bloodbath that is  the modern horror-movie. This one has influenced everything from ""the  Exorcist"" to ""Rosemary's baby"", yet still feels like an original,  subtle classic. I loved it."
"The odds against writing and directing two all-time classic thrillers/suspensers back to back must be fairly remote, featuring your wife in both remoter still, and starring Yves Montand in the first (The Wages Of Fear, in case there are any first-time buyers out there) and his wife, Simone Signoret in the second, astronomical. Say hello - and tip your hat while you're about it - to Henri-George Clouzot who pulled off this double whammy with ease.  Clouzot made only a handful of films but those he did make were worth seeing, from Le Corbeau thru L'Assassin habite du 21 thru Quai des Orfevres and up to Wages and this one. Again many previous commenters have set the scene and described the plot and most of them are more than positive in their praise.  I can only endorse their opinions and raise a glass to all involved especially Paul Meurisse and Charles Vanel who tend to get lost in the shuffle. 9/10"
"This was the kind of movie you hear about for an eternity, but never manage to see, or, as in my case, just see the first half hour of and never get to see completely. And when you finally, after years or decades, see the movie, you mostly either mesmerized - or, like today, in the 'that's all?' kind of feeling. Being a huge Hitchcock fan, and knowing the history of 'Les Diaboliques' and how it propelled Hitch into making masterpieces as 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho', I sadly saw the story's solution coming way too early - namely, the instant one of the male teachers said to the other that Simone Signoret's character had quite a commanding presence (after about two thirds of the movie, as she was giving orders and then rushing up the stairs). The only logical, non-supernatural solution was the one that the movie ended with - that the title-giving diabolical ones where not the two women, but the sadistic headmaster and his mistress. I'd have loved to have a lot more 'signs of the unexplainable' bothering the women (both women, not just the frail wife) - aside from the missing corpse (always a great idea for a story), one of the boys having talked to the headmaster after his supposed death and the matter of the corpse's suit. In my opinion, the women quarreled to soon; and although I liked the performances at first, I soon found that Signoret's character was too obviously dominant, too self-assured, too straightforward and, most of all, a lot (!) too relaxed when the body of a person I just murdered happens to appear hundreds of miles away to be believable. As for Vera Clouzot's character: it was just way too convenient to have a rather young person have a heart condition in a thriller as not to mean something later on. The fact that the 'corpse' was seen standing in the bathtub on the cover of the DVD's German edition didn't help matters, either (in a rather small, but still recognizable picture)  But what bothered me most was the character of the private investigator. What was the point? So that he could mete out justice in the end? Since he obviously had a hunch who the real victim was, why didn't he warn her??? Bottom line: this is a picture one might (or should even, as a movie fan) have seen once, but unlike a lot of thrillers one knows the ending of, I see no reason to view 'Les Diaboliques' again. The absence of a composer of Bernard Herrmann's stature and the uneven camera worked against my involvement in the story, as well. I prefer 'Wait Until Dark', 'Psycho' or 'The Haunting' and quite a lot of others as far as suspense is concerned. Sorry, M. Clouzot, nice try, but I didn't buy this one. And rest in peace, Mr. Hitchcock, your rank as THE Master of Suspense is undisputed, in my book at least."
"Headmaster of a boarding school, Michel Delaselle (Paul Meurisse) is a brooding bully of a man, one day his wife and mistress decide enough is enough and plot to kill him, trouble is that once they murder him, his body disappears and reported sightings of him are adding to the ladies' paranoia.Thus is the setting for director Henri-Georges Clouzot's brilliant suspenser. The pace is stiflingly perfect, he gently racks up the tension, neatly toying with audience expectation, the sense of dread that hangs in the air is palpable. How refreshing it is to see a suspense film actually build its plot for a good hour? In this day and age the MTV generation would be walking out of this after 30 minutes. Armand Thirard's atmospheric photography accentuates the creeping menace like mood, to the point that when we get to the last 15 minutes, nerves are already frayed and we then of course get what is arguably the greatest bath scene ever, and ""that"" ending... When I first watched it back in 2008 it was on a poor quality DVD, but revisiting it on Blu-ray it still worked me over as the great suspense movie it is, forcing me to seek the solace of daylight ASAP. Great writing, great directing, great acting, the latter thriving due to Simone Signoret's dangerously simmering sexuality and Véra Clouzot's heartfelt vulnerability. It's one of the classic chillers of European cinema. And if you haven't seen it yet? Do what I did last night, get the Blu-ray, turn off the lights and just have a couple of candles flickering away in your peripheral vision. Maybe indulge in some stiff drinks like I did, and most of all, watch it on your own... 9/10"
"The boys' school in Saint Cloud, a suburb of Paris, run by Michel and Christina Delassale, serves as the background for one of the best suspense thrillers of the French cinema. The school belongs to Christina, but it's Michel who has the last word about everything. This penny pinching man insists in giving his students living at the boarding school the worst food money can buy. Michel is also a man who loves to slap his wife, and his mistress, Nicole Horner, who is a teacher at the school. When we first meet them, Nicole has a swollen eye and wears dark glasses to hide her shame. Obviously, everyone guesses what is really going on between Michel and Nicole, even his wife. Christina is aware of the extra-marital goings on between her husband and his mistress. A strong minded Nicole shows how she dominates the weaker Christine. Nicole, who is fed up with the situation convinces Christina something must be done. She sets things in motion to go to her home town during a brief vacation so that Christina and Nicole attract Michel to come after them as they have a plan of their own about how to deal with his abuses.The women's plan is to bring Michel's body back to the school and dump him in the murky swimming pool, where he would be discovered as drowned by accident, or perhaps his own suicide. When the pool is drained, there is no corpse. When one of Michel's suits is sent from a dry cleaner's the women are dumbfounded. When they go to investigate, the owner hands them a key for a nearby hotel room.Christina, who is a fragile woman with what appears to be a weak heart, feels guilty. When she reads in the newspaper about a drowning victim found on the Seine, she has to find out to see if it's her husband. Of course, the dead man is not Michel, which heightens the mystery. What Christina didn't count on is the retired inspector, Alfred Fichet, who watches her outside the viewing room at the morgue. This man will become the key figure to solving Michel's disappearance. ""Les Diaboliques"" was Clouzot's triumph because the suspense works until the end. He based his screen play in a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejar, who also served as the basis for ""Vertigo"". In fact, much has been said about the similarities between the two directors, but it is unfortunate because both men approached their work in different ways. Clouzot hints subtly at perhaps a lesbian relationship between Nicole and Christine as it appears both want to be rid of the horrible Michel.The acting is first rate. Simone Signoret, one of the best and most attractive actresses of her era, makes an earthy Nicole. She is calculating because there is a lot at stake. Vera Clouzot plays Christine as a bundle of nerves because of the gravity of her actions. Paul Meurisse is the evil Michel. Charles Vanet is the old inspector Fichet. Also in the cast, a young Michel Serrault, and the singer Johnny Holiday, who appears uncredited as one of the boys in the school.Henri Georges Clouzot was at the top of his craft and he clearly showed he was a master of suspense, bar none."
"Diabolique (1955)Slow, unexpected suspense, and gorgeous, understated filming. A pair of women completely different but in love with the same man, who they say they detest equally. A boy's boarding school filled with chatter and mischief and long, dark corridors. And a weirdly clever and intrusive retiring cop who may, or may not, be figuring this thing out as we go.Better than a whodunit mystery, this one actually sucks you in and makes you almost cry out for the victim you see in danger. The twist, the main one, is pretty astonishing, and not completely unreasonable, though you have to just marvel at some of the good luck needed to make it work. And good acting.In charge here is Henri-Georges Clouzot, who is famous mostly for this, and to a lesser degree the fabulous Wages of Fear from two years earlier. There is little here familiar for American audiences, except maybe the Hitchockian tone, paced with a steady build that would make the English director proud (but instead made him jealous, apparently, since Clouzot bought the script hours before Hitchcock was going to). The perfect pitch for dialog, for humor against the ominous background, and for the innocence of a bunch of naughty boys all add up to make a neverending suspense. The famous admonishment at the end not to talk about the film to people who hadn't seen it only emphasizes how good the film is the second time, even when you know what's going to happen. It isn't all about surprise, but about an expert manipulation of the medium, cinema, for maximum effect. It's a film not too different in style from the best of the dark, semi-Gothic dramas of American 1940s cinema (this is later), and even though you are busy reading subtitles at times, it clicks along with visual and gestural ease. Quite an experience."
"And once you've watched them both, you'll know why. While Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" may have been dealing with extra thematic material beneath its horrific surface, providing additional dimensions that the French film didn't have, ""Diabolique"" (or ""Les Diaboliques"" as it's known in France) is a thriller whose atmosphere and sense of mystery equal that of the great Hitchcock classic. The same dark, threatening black and white cinematography and bizarre, macabre goings-on of ""Psycho"" meet their French counterpart in ""Diabolique"", much to the viewer's delight. And while ""Psycho"" gave the world perhaps the most memorable scene revolving around a shower, ""Diabolique"" presents the most memorable scene[s] connected with a bathtub. More outstanding than any other bathtub scenes, in my opinon, including the ones from ""The Shining"".From the tension before the murder to the mysteries that arise afterwards, the suspense mounts to an eerie climax that remains one of the Cinema's most exciting, whether you predicted it or not. If you weren't expecting it, it will truly be a frightening and confusing (in a good way) surprise. If you successfully foretold it, it will satisfy your suspicions and still captivate your attention. The only thing that seems sub-par about the film is the police detective's role in the incidents during the climax and after. You may wonder why he didn't arrive on the scene earlier, or whether he could have prevented certain events from occurring. It seems awkward that he shows up when he did and knows all about what just happened. One gets the idea that perhaps French Production Codes of some kind had an effect on the plot at this point, giving the ending a somewhat forced and artificial flavor."
"A personal recollection: 'Life' magazine (only those of a certain vintage will remember Life magazine) came out with a heavy-duty spread on this flick when it was released, hailing it as perhaps the most frightening movie ever made (remember the film industry wasn't as old then as it is today). I was nine years old and I begged and pleaded with my parents to be allowed to see it, to no avail. I did not get a chance to see it until much later in life, when it showed up on television. By then 'Psycho' and its successors had pushed the envelope of screen horror beyond what this film gives us. Still, the movie stands up pretty damn well on the creepiness scale. It is interesting to know that Hitchcock wanted the rights to this, and intriguing to imagine what he would have done with it. It's interesting to note that the film makers were not above providing some comic relief, in the form of the landlord and his wife in the boarding house where the murder takes place. Well worth viewing, in spite of the trouble of reading subtitles."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Diabolique"" (1955) is a really good mystery drama. It starts as a drama and then later some of the characters must done something horrible, but the true suspense comes after something very ""not according to a plan"" happens.I liked the performances in this movie. Directing and writing was also great, as well as the involving story. The ending was surprising as well.Overall, ""Diabolique"" isn't a horror movie as its genre description says - its a very solid mystery drama. It has involving story and it is very well done. Good movie overall."
"...or, more exactly you feel it. the motivation of characters. the atmosphere of school. the relation between Christina and Nicole. and, sure, the end. who, if you see for the first time, it is more than impressive. that did it one of challenge - film. not only for the story and acting. but for the chance to discover a high quality thriller. a film who easy coul be defined as legendary. for a simple motif - it seems perfect. not only as Henry Clouzot work but for so many suggestions for imagine a version by Hitchcock. because all the small ordinary details are present. all what you expect becomes more than shown in admirable manner. the fragility of Vera Clouzot. the cold force of Simone Signoret. and, sure, the performance of Paul Meurisset. a beautiful work. admirable for each scene ."
"I expect that Criterion films are of certain importance. They are films that have something unique to offer. Even Armageddon deserves a certain amount of recognition. It documents the way that blockbusters are going nowadays.I can honestly say that I think I understand the importance of Diabolique. The film was most likely incredibly innovative for the time period. I am impressed that the only shots that felt dated were the head-on driving shots, and aside from those, the direction is entirely appropriate. It does not call attention to itself, it has grace, and it is not feel like it has been copied since. The script is tightly written, no lines are wasted.On a personal level, I felt a little disappointed. I figured out the ending very quickly. My father, who would have been 16 when this was released, had no idea the ending was coming at all. The originality of this ending has been sacked by modern thrillers, horrors, and dramas. Regardless of deciphering the ending, this is still worth watching, even for historical purposes."
"Superb acting and direction, excellent cinematography, and a plot ""twist"" you can see coming from a mile away -- with a really cheap final line, ""I saw her, I know I saw her,"" that's supposed to make you continue wondering, but doesn't.Did this ""work"" in 1955? Yes, apparently. It got a ton of PR and certain critics raved. ""Life"" magazine, for one, did a spread on how ""shocking"" it was. The ""don't reveal the ending"" title card predated Hitchcock's ""Psycho's"" marketing gimmick by a few years -- when audiences routinely walked in during the middle of a film.But there's a reason ""Psycho"" has withstood the test of time and rewards repeated viewings, and ""Diabolique"" is a cinema footnote.With ""Diabolique,"" you know EXACTLY what's coming -- and you're right. It's just a matter of seeing how cleverly, or not, Clouzot works it out. The ""suspense,"" such as it is, lies not in any real emotional involvement with the characters and situation (because you already know where the film is going), but rather in how thrillingly it's going to be depicted.Answer? Not very.In other words, the plot was stale even in 1955. So the ""suspense"" lies in seeing if Clouzot can bring new life to a tale as old as Euripides.Answer? No.The actors? Wonderful. Particularly the young Simone Signoret. Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, borders on Garboesque beauty and is fine, except when she veers off into bug-eyed terror (too often).""Psycho"" has been criticized for its final ""explanation"" scene by the psychiatrist. By contrast, that's Shakespeare compare to this claptrap quickie ending.What REALLY drives a stake through the heart of ""Diabolique"" is the schoolboy's last line, ""I saw her, I know I saw her."" Huh? This pseudo-profundity is supposed to make us imagine that maybe the lovers DIDN'T scare the wife to death? That she's actually still alive? To do WHAT? Get a divorce from this abusive husband like she should have done all along? ""HAUNT"" them from beyond the grave? What? Answer? Nothing.A lot of talent is wasted here on a third-rate plot with an insulting payoff.Amazing this was ever considered much of anything.It's not. ""Diabolique"" is a B-move posing as a French art-film ""shocker."""
"To anyone who has seen this masterpiece of suspense, you will know that I am not exaggerating when I call it one of the best thrillers of all time. 
I first saw ""Les Diaboliques"" in the theater three years ago, and it left such an impression that I felt compelled to purchase the Criterion DVD just recently.  Even after knowing what happens at the end of this movie won't spoil future viewings.  It is great at just about every level, from writing to acting to direction.  Vera Clouzot and Simone Signoret make a fantastic duo, and Paul Meurisse, an unforgettable villain.  The plot twists and turns without ever seeming too convoluted or contrived.  Every action and character motivation is believable.This movie puts most current thrillers to shame.  I can't name too many films of recent past that have taken my breath away such as this one.  This is exactly the type of movie that I feel like pushing on everyone I meet, which is most likely why I am writing this review.  Take my advice:  This movie is best seen with all the lights turned off."
"I loved this movie so much! This is because I rarely have had a movie throw so many surprises and twists into the plot! Movies too often doing the conventional and expected is one of the reasons I like to watch a lot of foreign films and this one takes the cake! The film is a ""noirish"" suspense film about two women who want to kill the same man. One is the wife and the other is his mistress. They both meet and agree to kill him together! That alone makes this an interesting twist! What they exactly do and the twists that occur I don't want to discuss, as it would really ruin the movie! Just believe me that the acting, writing and directing couldn't be better and when it was over, I was more than satisfied!"
"Please don't watch that awful remake with Sharon Stone. Enjoy this one.  The original. In French. In black and white. With English subtitles. With the ending that is followed by a plea not to reveal what has just happened. I love a film that sucks me in and fools me and ultimately makes me glad I've been fooled. I won't tell you what happens in the original. I will tell you that if you saw the recent remake, you were cheated. Big time."
"Maybe my expectations were just too high for this, but I have to say it was quite the disappointment. I didn't find Diabolique bad by any means, but hearing people say that it's better than anything Hitchcock ever did is pretty laughable in my eyes. I think it looks worse by comparison to Hitchcock, but in it's own right it's a solid, if not particularly impressive work. Concerning the wife and mistress of a school headmaster who conspire to murder him together, Henri-Georges Clouzot's film took a while to get going for me but once it did I found some solid enjoyment out of it.A lot of what makes it work comes more from the work of the two women at it's core. Simone Signoret, as the mistress, takes charge of the murderous plot and stands firm in her beliefs, cold and calculated. She's always trying to remain in control, remain collected, and when things start to unravel you can see her slowly twist at the idea of potentially suffering the consequences. Vera Clouzot, as the wife, takes on the more unstable, emotional role and she really makes it sing. She is wild, uncontrollable and never at rest. Whereas Signoret is very still and mannered, Clouzot bounces off the walls in her distress and this contrast between them drives the film more than anything the director himself does.There are some nice twists in the narrative that keep the mystery alive in the latter half of the film, along with a stunning final sequence that finally lived up to the hype that had been built around the film. The final sequence was mesmerizing and terrifying, culminating in a twist that I was surprised I didn't see coming. That being said, the resolution itself was disappointingly pedestrian. Overall though, I didn't find much to write home about here, although it was certainly good. This was my first Clouzot film and I'll be sure to check out several more of his works, but if this is a sign of what he has to offer me then I'm afraid I'll never be able to understand those who rank him above his English companion."
"As you watch this, notice the use of water. Dripping, flowing, lying about in stagnant pools. It's a brilliant device in this oppressive, eerie film. This is one of those ""often imitated, never copied"" sorts of films. Simone Signoret was never better. Unforgettable!"
"Based on the Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac novel CELLE QUI N'ETAIT PLUS, Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 DIABOLIQUE is easily among the most influential films of world cinema, leaving its mark on everything from Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO and PSYCHO to William Castle's THE TINGLER--but even so, and while Hitchcock's masterpieces can be said to at least equal the Clouzot original, few if any of the films spawned by DIABOLIQUE ever bested it.Variously known as DIABOLIQUE, LES DIABOLIQUES, and THE DEVILS, the film presents a complex story. Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot, wife of director Henri-Georges Clouzot), is a remarkably beautiful and considerably wealthy woman who has the misfortune to suffer from delicate health, personal timidity, and brutish husband Michel (Paul Meurisse.) The two operate a boys' school that Christina owns, and among the teachers is hard-nosed Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), who has become Michel's mistress but who finds Michel every bit as unpleasant as wife Christina.An unlikely alliance springs up between the two women, and together they conspire to murder Michel and thereafter run the school for themselves. But although the murder seems to go as planned, the body goes missing, and the two women suddenly find themselves taunted by mysterious notes and strange happenings. Has Michel survived the attempt on his life? Or has the murder been discovered and the stage is being set for blackmail?In the wake of DIABOLIQUE's international success, the story has been told in so many variations that many may consider the original has lost some of the shock value it possessed when it first debuted, but even so the film has much to offer. This is particularly true in terms of style and performances. Director Clouzot endows the film with a sense of visual decay and a near-documentary tone that merge to create one of the most chilling atmospheres ever captured on screen. While Signoret's performance of the angry mistress is the more widely celebrated, she is equaled by Vera Clouzot, who has the more complex role and whose performance must carry the weight of the film's most disturbing moments; together they create a truly remarkable synergy of the most lethal kind.I have seen DIABOLIQUE in several different releases, and while the Criterion DVD is somewhat glitchy it is easily the best version available; one should avoid all other releases, particularly the truly atrocious release by Madacy. Strongly recommended, particularly to fans of internation cinema and classic suspense.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"""Les Diaboliques"" is a classic murder mystery with a fascinating story, interesting characters, good plot twists and a sensational conclusion. On its release it achieved great commercial success and in the years since has maintained its popularity and served as a major source of inspiration for other filmmakers with many of its original elements being employed to great effect, especially in psychological thrillers. Its story was based on the novel ""Celle qui n'etait plus"" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. These are the same writers who wrote ""D'Entre des Morts"" which was the source material for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". There is a similarity between the two plots in the sense that revelations in the second half of both stories change the audience's perception of what they've seen in the first half.A strong feature of the movie is its characters (particularly those who comprise the menage a trois) and the time taken to explore the dynamic between them and their motivations is particularly pertinent to what happens later in the story. The combination of Henri-Georges Clouzot's skillful direction and Armand Thirard's cinematography contributes powerfully to the ominous atmosphere of the piece and the tension that prevails throughout.The setting for the action is a run down boarding school where the arrogant and abusive Principal Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) is despised by his staff, his pupils, his sickly wife Christina (Vera Clouzot) and his mistress Nicole (Simone Signoret). Christina is a rather timid ex-nun who owns the school and also has a heart condition. She's habitually humiliated by Michel's behaviour, his abuse and the fact that everyone in the school is aware of his infidelity. Nicole is a competent, assertive and rather calculating member of the staff who has been physically abused by Michel and at one stage wears dark glasses to conceal a black eye.Instead of being at loggerheads with each other, the two women become close as they reach the limit of their tolerance and decide that they can't endure their maltreatment any longer. They devise a plan to end their plight and go to Nicole's apartment in a village some distance away from the school during a holiday. Christina lures Michel to the apartment so that they can drown him and transport him back to the school where his body would be deposited in the swimming pool. The plan is successful and the women wait for the corpse to float to the surface so that it'll appear that Michel has died as the result of an accident. When the body fails to surface, the pool is drained but Michel's body has vanished. The events that follow make the women increasingly bewildered and anxious until eventually matters reach their shocking conclusion.Christina's character is particularly interesting because although she's the most financially powerful of the three, she's also the most diffident and the most fragile because of her poor health. Her religious beliefs prevent her from seeing divorce as an acceptable means of escape from her husband's abuse and yet her natural inclination to be compliant leads her into going along with the murder plot suggested by the more forceful Nicole. This in turn also makes her become full of anguish as the threat of discovery grows and more guilt ridden when she has more time to reflect on the part she'd played in what was an extremely wicked act.""Les Diaboliques"" is a marvellous and memorable movie with great performances from its three main characters, an enjoyable mixture of suspense and moments of black humour and the sort of power and quality which make it totally unforgettable. This is simply one of those movies that should be seen by everyone who enjoys cinema because regardless of their reaction to it, they'll never forget it."
"This is without a doubt the best work of its genre.  To find a film which leaves one's head spinning at the enormity of plot and literally keeps one in suspense until the very last few frames is rare, but coupled with the incredible acing and characterisations, this can be the only film of its kind. DON'T MISS IT!!"
"This movie epitomizes for me the reason movies exist. To let you know that somewhere, sometime, someone else was exactly in the same place that you are. They understand you. The words flow from actors mouths as they would from your mind at that very moment.At no point in this film do you ever consider that you are watching a staged, rehearsed, acted scene. Director just behind the camera giving instruction. Hours spent in the editing room piecing it together just right. This is easily one of the most natural feeling movies I have ever seen and contains one of the most suspenseful scenes ever put to tape.I've been watching thriller/horror/suspense movies practically since birth. Used to sneak into the living room after my parents went to sleep to watch them. So, needless to say, I've gotten to a point that I am rarely impressed, much less affected in such a way by such a movie. And to think...this was made almost 50 years ago. Exceptional."
"Like Stanley Donen's 1963 thriller CHARADE, Henri-Georges Clouzot's DIABOLIQUE is one of the best Hitchcock films that Hitchcock DIDN'T make! The crucial difference is that CHARADE recalls playful, polished, soignée Hitchcock films such as NORTH BY NORTHWEST, while DIABOLIQUE, based on a novel by Boileau & Narcejac of VERTIGO fame, is more like a precursor of Hitch's darker, more sinister PSYCHO. I understand Clouzot snatched up the film rights to the Boileau/Narcejac novel about half an hour before Hitchcock got a crack at it. It would have been fascinating to see Hitch's approach to the material. Darkly magnificent as PSYCHO is, DIABOLIQUE's gloomy, misogynistic take on the story sinks into your gut and haunts your dreams. Even DIABOLIQUE'S opening credit sequence immediately makes us uneasy with its merciless close-up of the run-down DeLassalle Boarding School's murky, mossy swimming pool, accompanied by children shrilly singing Georges Van Parys's music off-key and off-screen. The film starts out at a leisurely pace, but as it goes along, the tension tightens like a noose, helped by skillful use of shadows and light. Without giving away its twists, I'll only say that DIABOLIQUE gives new meaning to the phrase ""cruel to be kind."" Vera Clouzot (yes, the director's Mrs., or should I say Mme.?) and Simone Signoret are electrifying as, respectively, the long-suffering wife and mistress of manipulative, sadistic headmaster Paul Meurisse. As the women plot to kill the bastard, Clouzot's delicate loveliness and anxious air (her character has a heart condition that contributes to the suspense -- as if the poor gal doesn't have enough problems!) plays beautifully off Signoret's sexy, smoldering intensity. Which is scarier, the water sports in DIABOLIQUE or in PSYCHO? Watch them and decide for yourselves! :-) Grade: A+"
"This movie is simply amazing on all fronts. It is in fact so amazing, you can't even comprehend how amazing it is until you watch it a 2nd time. Spend the 2nd time looking for plotholes, and then become frustrated when you don't find any. Bothered by the fact that film seems to move slow without a musical score? I was too at first. And then I realized how brilliant it it was. The lack of score helps to create greater tension, adding a Tell-Tale Heart quality to the story.(If you aren't familiar with the Edgar Allen Poe story of the same name, you must live under a rock. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.) The screenplay is airtight, not a single plothole. The acting is all top-notch. Extremely well-directed. If you thought this film was good, let me help persuade you towards my view. Think about when this was made, and think about the other films made at the time. This movie would stand-out as a great film today. The fact that it was made almost fifty (50, the big 5-0) years ago and you see that a true classic never goes out of style. The only reason I can think of anyone not loving this movie is they either can't appreciate a good film or are too closed-minded to watch a film that isn't in their own language. If you understand the intricacies of film-making, you will also realize how simply amazing this film is. Still not convinced? What if I tell you that Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock was heavily influenced by this film when making Psycho, which is regarded as in most circles as the greatest thriller of all time. H.G. Clouzout first employed the practice of not letting anyone into Diabolique after it started. And don't forget about the twist ending so commonly seen and overused in today's cinema. How many times have you seen a twist ending in a thriller? It all started with Diabolique. Do yourself a favor and check this film out. And do your friends a favor and tell them about this suspense masterpiece. Forget about the fact that it is in subtitles. Turn the lights off. ENJOY."
"I just finished watching this film and I was astonished at how magnificient it was.  I wished I had seen this in French class or in any class for that matter.  Called ""The Deviants"" or ""The Devils"" in english, this film was even better than I anticipated it would be. This has become my favorite foreign film of all time and on the top ten list for best classic horror/thriller movie.  I can think of several movies right off the top of my head that have used this one as inspiration but I gotta say it can't be surpassed.  When I saw the title I realized this film was sampled on ""Sadeness"" by Enigma one of my favorite songs (why it was mentioned I confess I don't know perhaps they enjoyed it too).  I also want to thank everyone who wrote reviews here and the people on the boards for not giving away the ending and keeping their promise I find that very admirable in this day and age.  I know I will wild animals couldn't drag it out of me.  I will end my comments by saying that Les Diaboliques was a extraordinary cinematic achievement and I don't think anyone can recreate this story and make it even a tenth as good."
"French thrillers always feature a strong social background:see Claude Chabrol's movies for instance.Such is the case with ""Diabolique"".In ,say,""Vertigo"" (which,like""Diabolique,was inspired by a Boileau-Narcejac novel),the social background is nowhere to be seen;that doesn't prevent Hitchcock 's movie from being a masterpiece though.Clouzot's screenplay is much different from the original novel.The action doesn't take place in a lousy school on the paper.Clouzot wanted to be ""realistic"" ,that's why he literally created the two-bit boarding-school and the grotesque teachers.The actors were so good they survived their unbelievable characters.Another significant difference between Clouzot and Hitchcock:the former saves the ""surprise"" for a final that leaves you on the edge of your seat,the latter-in ""Vertigo""- tells the audience the whole truth before the last third,and studies his character -who does not know- and his psychological reactions.Generally,in France ,critics favor Hitch over Clouzot,but the two directors can't be compared because their approaches are diametrically opposite.This is not legend.It is fact:this is the greatest French thriller ever.I'm overjoyed when I read all those enthusiastic reviews from abroad after all the negative ones I 've read in my native France.Thanks to you,all IMDb users!!"
"Two female teachers at a boys' boarding school conspire to bump off the cruel headmaster, who is married to one of the ladies and finishing an affair with the other. French director Henri-Georges Clouzot, whom some have compared to Alfred Hitchcock, is so plot-driven as a filmmaker that he tends to skitter over minute details, such as a forgotten set of keys in a suit or another set of keys at the bottom of a swimming pool. Stray ends such as these tend to linger in the mind after the film is over, lessening the picture's overall impact. Clouzot also produced the film and co-adapted the screenplay from Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac's novel ""Celle qui n'était plus"", and perhaps got too carried away with a sub-plot involving a retired detective. The finale is mounted beautifully for suspense but, again, Clouzot is so maddeningly tied to the plot mechanisms that there isn't any room for surprises. Remade for American television as ""Reflections of Murder"" in 1974, and again theatrically as ""Diabolique"" with Sharon Stone in 1996. **1/2 from ****"
"My Rating : 5/10'Les diaboliques' is primarily known for it's twist ending and if you as a viewer are not sold on it and I'm not - well, that's the way the cookie crumbles!Certainly watch it for a bit of old film history where Henri-Georges Clouzot out-Hitchcocked Hitchcock."
"Released in 1955, ""Diaboliques"" (translated as 'The Devils') has often been described as the most Hichcockian non-Hitchcock feature film: this assessment is flattering as long as it doesn't diminish the directorial talent of Henri-George Clouzot.It's true that Henri-George Clouzot's psychological thriller features several archetypes that cemented the legend of the droll-profile director. Much more, with a dead man in a bathtub (no spoiler, here), a plot focusing less on the crime committed than its mysterious aftermath, a palpable sexual tension and a spectacular twist ending, the film has the most comparable plot to ""Psycho"". However, the comparison overlooks that Clouzot was already considered a master in the mystery and thriller genre, to which ""Diaboliques"" blends both elements. His heart-pounding ""Wages of Fear"" had already chilled the spine of viewers in all over the world. So, no matter how close ""Diaboliques"" is to ""Psycho"", it still was the first comer and in fact, without ""Diaboliques"", there wouldn't be ""Psycho"". Legend had it that Clouzot bought the rights of the novel written by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac a few hours before Hitch. Granted he was already an iconic director, there are chances that without ""Psycho"", everyone would have praised ""Diaboliques"" as the most suspenseful and horrific thriller ever instead of any Hitchcock's film, so it's very probable that the Master of Suspense took the case personally. Then ""Diaboliques"" made a sensation in the United States, became the favorite film of Robert Block, who wrote ""Psycho"" for Hitch, the rest is history. Using a shower instead of a bathtub, the film borrows many elements from ""Diaboliques"" including as spectacular climax: Clouzot's thriller is infamous for its anti- spoiler message at the end, begging the viewers not to be devilish and reveal the ending. But the interest of ""Diaboliques"" doesn't rely on the ending only; the film opens with an intriguing set of relationships that confine to 'triangular hatred'. Vera Clouzot is Christina, a frail, sickly and insecure brunette, wife of Michel Delasalle, the headmaster of a Provincial boarding school, played by the great Paul Meurisse, a tyrant with both kids and the teachers and a bully with his wife: the only area where she can control him is financial, she owns the school. There is the obligatory mistress, played by Simone Signoret, who's everything Christina is not: blonde, sexy and commanding. In this masterstroke of casting it's easy to see in the contrast between the two women, the roots for a genuine attraction, Signoret becomes 'manly' with Christina while Christina is totally passionless regarding her marriage. The talent of Clouzot is to keep a cloud of ambiguity floating within the main atmosphere, thanks to a convincing yet misleading characterization. Vera Clouzot might not be the greatest actress of her era, only remembered for her roles in ""Diaboliques"" and ""Wages of Fear"", she magnificently transcends her limited range into one of the most memorable and poignant movie performances with her constant nervousness, accent, and petite frame, towered by Meurisse who's described as a 5'7'' tall man, the typical mistreated woman. When she consents to help Nicole in the murder of her husband with Nicole, the plan itself might be ""diabolique"" but I refused to tag Christina with such an epithet, because after the murder is committed, the film climbs the ladder from a simple thriller to a masterpiece of horror and mystery.Indeed, never has the word 'heart pounding' been so fitting to describe a thriller. In ""Diaboliques"", Christina suffers from a heart condition, which ironically meets reality because the real actress died five later of a heart attack. But this device plays a pivotal role in the way her body responses to a series of strange occurrences ensuing the murder. All through the film, the mystery suggests a sort of devilish presence, starting with a body dropped in the swimming pool waiting to float and make it appear like an accident, then disappearing, a silhouette in a photograph's background. The feeling of a set-up, intended to drive Cristina into madness, reminds of another Hitchcockian non-Hitchcock classic: ""Gaslight"", but with a darker undertone, more macabre, indeed more devilish.I wouldn't go further, out of respect to Clouzot who made his wish explicit at the end of the film, hoping no one would see the film after the dreadful remake, because 80% of the legend -not the quality- that elevated ""Diaboliques"" to its iconic status, depends on the gripping climax and the heart-pounding four minutes before. But there is much more to say about the film, in terms of entertainment. Many philosophical words are used to describe Clouzot's films: existential, pessimistic, nihilistic etc. I suspect the man was beyond labels, and more eager to create sensational films. He was a craftsman of cinematic experiences, providing the right levels of emotions with never being their slave. Clouzot's films always featured a gallery of colorful characters, whom the viewers could identify with, and ""Diaboliques"" is no exception: Pierre Larquay, the elderly teacher, a young Michel Serrault, George Poujouly, the kid from ""Forbidden Games"", Noël Roquevert and on the top of all, the scene-stealing performance of Charles Vanel as Inspecteur Fichet. Coming from nowhere, Vanel is the man who asks the questions with the nonchalance of the friendly routine-guy while his tendency to forget the questions hides his real goal which is to confront the people with their own contradictions. As small as it was, Fichet inspired one of the most beloved TV characters: ""Columbo"", another reason to thank Clouzot for ""Diabioliques"".So, if you're a fan of ""Columbo"", of ""Hitchcock"", of French cinema, of movies with twist endings, there's no excuse not to see ""Diaboliques"", one of the best thrillers ever."
"Diabolique is a very interesting story, a very interesting idea. It reminds me of another film with a similar premise. Who knows if one inspired the other. Another interesting item to note is Simone Signoret's costume and hairstyle. At the beginning of the film we see her with cropped, bleached blond hair, dark sunglasses even indoors and fairly fashionable clothing. It reminded me of seeing Shelly Winters is some publicity photos.The acting isn't perfect though. At times it seems amateurish or maybe not quite thought out. There is a hesitancy with one of the lead characters that doesn't seem so much the character but the actress herself. And some of the dialog seems very outdated. In fact, a lot of the film seems outdated. I wouldn't dismiss this film at all. As I said before it is very unique but I honestly feel that many people will be put off by the age of the film. The fact that much of it is really rather slow and some of it just hasn't aged well at all. It feels creaky. If you are a fan of older, black & white films you'll probably enjoy this but if more modern films with a polished feel and chase scenes are more your style, I'd skip it."
"Nicole and Christina believe they have committed the perfect murder of a lover and husband who was anything but the tenderhearted, most loving person in the world. That man is Michel, a principal of a male boarding school his wife Christina paid for with her wealth. Michel holds everyone at bay because he has this powerfully vile hold over everyone from his perpetually ""walking-on-egg-shells"" wife to the teachers under his watch. He is really abusive toward Christina who is weak with an exterior so shaken with fear she suffers from a heart condition. What makes the opening of this film so fascinating is Clouzot doesn't show the building of the set-up for murdering Michel, but we hear through their dialogue this planning of the event for quite some time. What is also jarring is that Nicole and Christina seem to be friendly with one another which is startling since Nicole is Michel's lover. There's an instance when Nicole is about to share what Michel told her in bed regarding his wishes for his wife's demise to Christina! It is quite interesting that Nicole is the instigator of the actions that soon occur regarding how they set-up Michel and kill him. We watch as this whole scenario takes place which leaves little doubt that Nicole and been premeditating how to kill Michel for quite some time. One mistake of course is deciding to include Christina in her plans to the whole set-up and murder since she's so weak-kneed that any little minute ordeal would throw her into a frenzy.Once the deed is indeed over and they toss Michel's body in the nasty, murky pool beside the school, it's all about someone discovering it. That tricky part really ratchets up the true tension in the story. Christina, who is finding it unbearable waiting day after day as that body is supposedly waiting on the bottom undiscovered, has the pool drained but, to her horror, no body is found. Where did that body go? Who removed it? Was he dead? Throughout the film, Nicole and Christina deal with the underlying guilt from their deed and mistrust which starts to loom over their ""relationship"" like a rain-cloud when going to the police station often becomes a topic of conversation.A detective makes things even worse as he represents a constant reminder that their crime is always on display as awaiting that final axe to chop never goes away. Christina is also a devout catholic which only adds to the luggage of guilt already weighing her down.Good casting, very intelligent story-line(that develops after the ""perfect murder"" rather than focusing on it as what usually takes place in mysteries), and a suspenseful build-up with questions abound that keeps the viewer guessing at what will happen as that body stays missing. Though clues of his existence as a living man seems possible, the film is slippery at actually showing him while pulsating the theme of Christina's inner strife at what she has done. Great film-making in every possible way."
"Before I saw this film, I wouldn't go near a 'thriller', or a foreign film, and definitely not one that was made thirty years before I was born.Afterwards however, I couldn't get enough. Vera Clouzot is, quite frankly, mesmerising in the lead, and the film has plenty of genuinely chilling moments, not least with the image in the window.Foreign language films can be a bit daunting at first, but this is a great place to start, and fans of any age would be well advised to check it out.Henri Clouzot has been compared to Hitchcock, but this film seems to creep up on you even more than Psycho, and for its age, is doubtlessly one of the best films around."
"LES DIABOLIQUES is one of the greatest suspense thrillers of the twentieth century, due to its flawless plot, perfect characters, and atmosphere of horrific, growing dread. The story is -unfortunately for anyone trying to watch it without knowing anything about it!- well known. Christina Delassalle (Vera Clouzot), the Head Mistress of a boys boarding school, and her husband's mistress, Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) carry out their plan to do away w/ said despicable husband, Michel (Paul Meurisse), only to discover that it didn't quite go the way they thought it had. Something has apparently gone very wrong, seeming almost supernatural in nature. Has Michel somehow returned? Was he ever really gone? Maddening clues and shocking revelations abound, as Christina and Simone seem more desperate w/ each passing moment! The police are looking into the matter as well, represented by the dogged Detective, Alfred Fichet (Charles Vanel). The grand finale is nothing short of genius, standing as one of the most breathtaking endings in any such film! A masterpiece of the genre that bears many viewings..."

"Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 thriller ""Les diaboliques"" (simply called ""Diabolique"" in English) is widely known as one of the greatest murder mysteries of all time. And trust me, you have to see it to believe it. Not only the plot, but the camera angle, lighting, and absence of music combine to make one of the most intense pieces of work out there. I did not see that ending coming, even though there were clues throughout the movie. The entire cast puts on outstanding performances (I've only seen a few of Simone Signoret's movies, but she always did a perfect job). It's too bad that Véra Clouzot died a few years after the release; she could've gone on to have one of the finest careers.It's not the scariest movie ever, but still one of the cleverest. The first few minutes aren't much, but once Nicole and Christina carry out their deed, things REALLY get going (and if the end shocks us in the 21st century, imagine how it seemed way back when).Having seen this one, I'm eager to see Clouzot's earlier ""Wages of Fear"". ""Diabolique"" is one for the ages; there was a US remake, but I'm not interested in that one.And remember, don't reveal the ending!"
"Christina (Véra Clouzot) is the owner of a private boys boarding school and is one its teachers. Despite her ownership of the school, her abusive husband Michel (Paul Meurisse) is the headmaster. He is also abusive to the boys and the staff including his mistress Nicole (Simone Signoret), another teacher. Christina and Nicole devise a plot to kill Michel. From then on, everything goes awry.I believe that every film buff remembers how they felt during the last fifteen minutes of this brilliant thriller during the first viewing. This segment has to be one of the most frightening, nail-biting sequence in film history. As if this wasn't enough, it is followed by a shocking plot twist.The thrill of seeing this film the first time cannot be matched. But even knowing its conclusion, there is still much tension and suspense seeing it again. (This was my third viewing.) Director Henri-Georges Clouzot pays perfect attention to detail and from one second to the next, each moment seems to have the potential to veer into chaos. Whether it does so or not is the mystery.And of course, H-G Clouzot brings out the best in his cast. Signoret is at her signature best but it is Véra Clouzot who stands out especially in the climactic scene.""Diabolique"" (aka ""Les Diaboliques"") was written by director Clouzot and Jérôme Géronomi and based on the novel ""Celle qui n'était plus"" by Boileau-Narcejac.Unforgettable.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Henri-Georges Clouzot"
"Diabolique is the kind of film that one should never see more than once, and no film maker should ever try to make it again. My first viewing in the mid 1950s was a great movie experience. I was drawn to the wonderful suspenseful picture that M. Clouzot had made and was blow away by the ending. That should have been the end. Last night after more than 50 years I watched it again. Poor me. I was doomed to watch a great suspense film but I knew how it ended. There's something punishing in that. So all I could do was to be impressed with the acting, the photography, the film sets, and criticize some of its implausibility (What well- off French family would send a kid to this school? Who wouldn't want the two woman to kill off ""The Head"" someone without any redeeming human values? Why was the ending made so abrupt when it was the key to the picture and needed some digestion?) I must say that Mdm Clouzot's death portrayal was worth seeing again. It's better than anything James Cagney ever did. And the retired police commish could have been good for a series of about four more mysteries."
"I just saw this 50's mystery thriller, and I was surprised. Most movies made in the 50's don't scare me, but this film left me trembling.The film tells the story of two women working for a cruel and abusive boarding school principal. Tired of being hurt, verbally and physically, the women plan and execute the man's murder during the holidays. I don't want to give away too much, for it's vital you see it without knowing the ending. The last fifteen minutes of this film pack a strong and chilling punch with wonderful suspense and subtlety you don't see anymore. It is a masterful thriller with a twist ending matching that of ""Psycho"" and ""The Sixth Sense"". I recommend it to anyone who is able to watch older movies. Fans of slasher and killer films that get their scares from gore and shocks, stay away."
"For a brief period during the 1950s, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot temporarily swiped the title of ""The Master of Suspense"" from Alfred Hitchcock, owing to a string of well-received suspense thrillers, most notably 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' The latter was an adaptation of the novel ""Celle qui n'était plus (She Who Was No More)"" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac; it was released in the UK as 'The Devils,' and in the United States as 'Diabolique.' Upon its initial release, the film was extensively likened to the work of Hitchcock {who, popular legend tells us, missed out on purchasing the novel rights by a mere few hours}, with its slow-burning, deliberately-paced suspense, and a shocking twist that I never for a moment saw coming. Though, with the notable exception of two scenes  both involving a murder, with only one of them being real  the film isn't particularly scary, the tension, the paranoia and the blackened shadows often become overwhelming, and Clouzot deftly toes the line between supernatural evil, and the evil that lurks within all of us.Christina Delassalle (Véra Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), both teachers at a boarding school for young boys, have a rather peculiar friendship. Christina is married to Michel (Paul Meurisse), a violent and tyrannical husband who derives pleasure from humiliating his pretty but physically-delicate wife. Nicole, conversely, is Michel's mistress, a proud and independent woman who knows how to take control of a situation. At one point in the film, upon witnessing the two woman quietly conversing, a fellow professor makes a fascinated remark: ""I may be reactionary, but this is absolutely astounding - the legal wife consoling the mistress! No, no, and no!"" The mere fact that Christina and Nicole have become close should already hint at a sinister situation underlying the surface, and, indeed, it is soon revealed that the two women plan to murder Michel and ridding themselves of his oppression. The ""murder"" itself  a sedative in the alcohol, and drowning their unconscious victim in the bathtub, is exceedingly disturbing, as we guiltily and uneasily ask ourselves if we'd have the courage to carry through such a scheme.Alfred Hitchcock often delighted in creating suspense through the audience's subversive empathy for a film's villain, as a murderer attempts frantically to remove all traces of their crime. Clouzot uses a similar technique in his film, though, given the loathsome nature of the murder victim, our sympathy for the two women is almost demanded of us. However, the disappearance of Michel's body from the school swimming pool is completely unexpected, and either hints at a supernatural overtone, or that somebody else is quite obviously aware of their terrible crime. The paranoia from here rarely lets up, and we continually bombard ourselves with an endless stream of questions, unable to provide an answer for any of them. On a weaker note, despite the ever-present air of tension, few scenes actually succeeded in getting my heart pumping at a mile-a-minute, which was a slightly disappointing response that I can't quite explain. Perhaps a few sequences need to have been shortened slightly, just to swipe off ten unnecessary minutes, and allowing for a brisker pace that never gives you a chance to exhale."
"Quite simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made. Im not a film expert and i don't know all the fancy terms or technical jargon, I've never taken a film appreciation class or gone to a movie premier. But with this movie, none of that really matters. When i watch movies, very rarely do any emotions manifest themselves physically, and never from horror films. This was different. I was more horrified, disturbed, and awe stricken by this than any other movie. Goosebumps, raised hair, at the climax i actually had to get up and walk around. I was absolutely astounded that a movie could affect me that way. I found this movie interesting from the beginning definition of ""les diaboliques"" as ""little devils,"" up until the ending. The ending. That fantastically astounding, genius, breathtaking, work of art ending.Whats surprising about this film is the quality of the (special) effects for 1955. If it was made again today there is not one thing i would change about it. Great acting, writing, directing, lighting, scenery, you name it. I love Hitchcock but even his movies have not managed to thrill me like this has, and when i think of Hitchcock i think old, classic movies. This is not a classic, it is timeless, untouched by the gimmicky film effects of the time.You don't have to like old movies to like this. You don't have to like black and whites, or foreigns. You don't have to like reading subtitles. If you like movies, if you watch movies, you will like this one. If it sounds like I'm trying to get you to watch this, its because i am. I have been using IMDb for years, and this is the first review I've ever written. I love this movie so much i felt obligated to review it in hopes to influence at least one person to experience it. This is hands down the best movie I've ever rented. If you watch it, do so alone, and in the dark."
"Les Diaboliques is pure brilliance. Rarely have I ever been so tense in my life. This film is definitely one that must be watched alone and in the dark. It's chilling, especially due to the brilliant cinematography and the beautiful black and white which makes the film extra eerie. Although some of the acting could be a tad overdone, there really isn't anything to complain about in that department.The story is about a Headmaster, Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) and his wife (Vera Clouzot) and mistress (Simone Signoret) looking for a way out of his tyranny. So they both create a plot to murder him.This isn't the type of thriller that involves things jumping out at you followed by loud bangs of music. This is all about the unexpected. There are scenes where I was holding my breath and clenching the couch in nervous tension. When nothing seemed to happen I felt relived, then I saw something and it hit me and scared the hell out of me. And nothing will prepare anyone for the shocker of an ending. I was literally blown away, it was huge and extremely scary.5/5."
"The very best really artistic horror film ever. I saw Diabolique on a double date at the Larkin Theatre on a rainy night in San Franciso in '55, while I was at Cal Berkeley. We got into the lobby just before the showing ended. It was the last film I ever saw (if not the last ever) where the ushers (remember them?) enforced a ""no one will be seated 15 minutes before the end"" rule (in those days you could go in at any time). I remember hearing the screams from the audience from behind the closed doors, and their shaken looks when they exited. Actually, when we were seeing it, about 15 minutes before the end our dates were seated in our laps! Which was great. The only thing was I couldn't go into the bathroom at my dorm alone for the next week. Then, in 1960, to make it worse, Psycho was released, and I couldn't take a shower for a long time. I played Diabolique for my three kids on a Halloween (about 30 years later) and I don't have to tell you what happened. Then Jaws came along . . . If you haven't seen Diabolique, you are in for a real treat, and a really classy scare. See it alone with someone you love (or whatever). The Old Blue Buff."
"I've seen Les Diaboliques with its very high rating on IMDb for a few years. But I thought to myself, it can't be that good - it's French. I finally gave it a chance. How wrong was I? I've never been more happy with a blind purchase in my life.Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse) is the headmaster of an all-boys school. He's an abusive person to both his wife (Vera Clouzot - the director's wife) and his mistress (Simone Signoret) - both of whom work at the school. The wife and mistress decide they can't take it anymore and hatch a plot to kill Michel. The plan is carried out and the body is placed where it can be found. The problem is no one finds the body. It's gone. Things turn from bad to worse (and more horrifying) when students begin reporting that they have seen Michel roaming through the school. Any more of the story would be far too much.I do my best not to rate a movie 10/10 after a first viewing. But every once in a while, I stumble upon a real classic that I can't help but call perfect. The acting is very impressive, especially Vera Clouzot as the fragile wife. I felt every emotion she expressed. The plot is fantastic. Even though I figured out what was going to happen, it didn't matter. The movie is so well written that it was just a joy to watch it unfold. The sets are about the best I've seen. Everything looked just as I would expect from a French movie made so close to end of the war. Nothing was changed to make things look ""pretty"". It's dirty and it works. I could go on and on like this, but you get the idea.Clouzot has been called the ""French Hitchcock"" and it's easy to see why. He handles a movie with Hitchcockian type themes as well as Hitchcock might have himself. His decision to allow the movie the time necessary to build atmosphere and to allow the audience to get to know the characters is something I find sorely missing in many of today's movies.I highly recommend this one."
"Les Diabloiques is perhaps the finest of the film noir genre. Simone Signoret is best remembered for her femme fatale role in this stylish, suspenseful film.  Henri-Georges Clouzot beat out none other than Alfred Hitchcock for the rights to the novel from which Les Diaboliques was adapted (by Clouzot).  Hitchcock could scarcely have done better with the material.Above all, however, I would urge people to see this original version and NOT the 1996 American remake with Sharon Stone taking on Signoret's role.  If you have seen the remake but not the original, please go back and see how good this film was with Clouzot's masterful script and direction and shot in glorious black & white.  A comparison of the two provides a wonderful illustration of how the script, while certainly of great importance, is not the final determining factor on how a film turns out.  Direction and acting make all the difference here."
"Henri-Georges Clouzot is one of my favorite French directors.  He imbued his films with an atmosphere that is his trademark. See also:  le Corbeau (The Raven) and Le salaire de la peur (Wage of Fear). This film is such an incredible suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end.  When there is such talent and perfection in a film the first time around, why bother ruining it years later with a remake?"
"This is another of those ""snipe hunt"" movies. I don't know how people pick them to play jokes on others, and I don't care, because the people who rave about piles of crap like this are totally psychotic.It's the story that takes forever to tell, and just wastes your time. A man has a gorgeous young super model wife he wants to kill so he can beat up a pale, homely mistress. The two women conspire to kill him, but you'll fall asleep long before anything ever happens. Yes, you're right. This movie makes no sense, and it makes no sense that a bunch of yokels rave about it, but after watching it, you'll know that those yokels were laughing at you all the time, tricking you into watching this ordeal.I could elaborate more, but suffice to say this is beyond boring. For the first 40 minutes, absolutely NOTHING happens, and you just want to get your hands on the jerk who tricked you into watching this, holding your bag for the snipe that doesn't exist.There simply isn't a single saving grace to this pile of trash. Be forewarned, you will realize you went on a snipe hunt if you try to watch it. I doubt you can stay awake through it in one sitting, though, unless you're a complete masochist."
"This was a beautifully crafted film.  The sequence involving a search through a darkened house had me on the edge of my seat with my heart pounding.  BUT, the ending was very easy to figure out and that was a huge disappointment.  However, in this day of slasher/brainless horror films that lack any true suspense, this movie stands out as being one of quality.  It is worth seeing but don't be too disappointed by the so called shocking ending."
"Despite my dad having picked up the DVD years ago,I for some reason have never got round to seeing auteur director Henri-Georges Clouzot's epic Film Noir Horror.With the October Horror Challenge taking place on IMDb's Horror board,I decided that it was the perfect time to finally discover how ""Diaboliques"" things could get.The plot:Stomping round the second-rate boarding school like he owns the place, Michel Delassalle finds his wife Christina not willing to give up her sole ownership of the school,even when he flaunts fellow teacher/less than secret mistress Nicole Horner in front of Christina.Getting pushed in between them,Horner becomes increasingly frustrated at Michel's behaviour.Getting sick of the mistreatment that Michel inflicts on both of them,Nicole starts devising a plan with Christina to murder Michel.Traveling together to a remote village, Christina gets her husband to come down by threatening to divorce him.Revealing to Michel that she was just messing around in order to get him to come down,Christina gives Michel a drink to calm down.Unknown to Michel,the duo have laced the drink with sleeping sedatives.Getting Michel in a bath,Horner drowns him whilst Christina gets a led weight. Throwing Michel's body in the school's dirty outdoor swimming pool, Christina and Nicole soon discover that their diabolic act won't sink.View on the film:Hating every moment on the set due to co-writer/ (along with Jérôme Géronimi/René Masson & Frédéric Grendel) director Henri-Georges Clouzot only paying her for 8 weeks,despite the shoot overrunning to 16 weeks,the elegant Simone Signoret gives a chilling performance as Nicole Horner,with the behind the scenes issues being strongly suggested by Signoret giving Nicole a frosty femme fatale edge over the pouring with emotion Christina. Circling round Christina and Michel,Signoret gives Nicole a striking masculinity,as Nicole has to grip Christina's fragile nerves over the plan,whilst laying on the brash charm for her lover Michel.Showing that she does not take the role easy despite being married to the director, the stunning Véra Clouzot (who sadly died at age 46) gives an incredible performance as Christina Delassalle .Being far less confident on the plan than Nicole is, Véra Clouzot brilliantly balances Christina's tense excitement over the act,and the burnt nerves that follow an unexpected turn in the plan. Joining Signoret & Véra Clouzot, Paul Meurisse gives an excellent performance as Michel,with Meurisse giving Michel a hard-nosed brittle edge,with Meurisse blunt dialogue delivery building anticipation to Nicole & Christina putting their plan into action.Grabbing the rights to Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac novel just before Hitchcock made an attempt,the writers spend the first 30 minutes pulling up the decaying Film Noir school,with the writers making a satirical comment on the French education system,as Michel has an equal disregard for the education of the children,and the feelings of his lovers.Keeping away from drying the title up with social dissection,the writers paint a superb Film Noir galley of dread,as Christina & Nicole's mutual mistrust crashes against Michel,with the cold and calculating femme fatale Nicole having to keep the terrified out of her wits Christina on track at all cost. Striking the title with a deliciously macabre twist ending,the writers delicately place the clues to the ending with a real precision, which allows the viewer to see the relationships between Michel.Nicole & Christina from a completely different angle.Placing a tar pit swimming pool by the school,director Henri-Georges Clouzot and cinematographer Armand Thirard sink the trio into murky Film Noir waters,with Clouzot & Thirard covering the screen in long, looming shadows hiding deceit and betrayal. Highlighting the horror elements,Clouzot uses dazzling close-ups on Christina's face to capture the shock of terror being cast across her face,as the ruins start to crumble."
"""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) ranks as one of the most intelligently written and directed psychological thrillers I've ever seen. It's a film for enthusiasts and one that requires patience, as it slowly adds layers to it's story, builds suspense and ends with a surprise double twist. It's all very interesting and absorbing.Two women conspire to murder a man. One is the wife and the other is the mistress. Things appear successful, until strange things begin to happen, challenging the sanity of one of the women. The opening credits appear with some surreal imagery and a haunting little music score, the only music of the film. Best enjoyed by serious film goers. Highly recommended."
"This beautifully made shocker, as with other great films, is filled with memorable details. Among them, is the setting in post-war France, with the shadows of WW2 seemingly casting a sombre pall on everything: the struggling economical problems of the characters; the look of distress on the buildings. The art direction by Barsacq captures fascinating details of the way furnishings and possessions of people looked. Another interesting element is the presentation of the students at the boarding school. The students seemed to be especially rowdy and disrespectful; was this typical behavior for students at French boarding schools in the 1950s?"
"More than 100 reviews, so I won't duplicate all the praise. For those who panned the film, I feel so sorry for you . . . go watch the Sharon Stone burlesque! I just want to add one thing: I saw this film during its original release at a theater in west LA (The Wilshire-Ebell) as a 15 year-old. The theater manager must have been a real film buff, since he ""contributed"" to one of the scariest scenes of the film. Near the end, there is a scene at the climax of a long, suspenseful investigation by the wife of the schoolmaster - she has heard mysterious noises in the deserted rooms, through long, dim, creaky corridors in the school building. At this point in the film, the lights in the schoolroom go out. Just at that point, the manager had the projectionist turn off all the house lights (dim as they were), as well! The effect instantly immersed everyone right into the scene! I remember many people yelling . . . I believe I was too frightened to make a sound."
"The were several possible solutions which occurred to me. One of them was as filmed. Another was the obvious ghost solution.But another possibility was that the body was actually found and quietly reported to the police. Then the ex-commissioner set a trap for the two women, who were obvious suspects because of the abuse. The traps the police used to check the ID of the naked body seemed to support this. It could have easily been the ex-commissioner who had the suit dry-cleaned and sent to the women. It was obvious that the suit was meant to scare the women. And he finally did get a confession, though his reaction showed that this wasn't the solution chosen.SPOILER: Actually, the movie's solution has a flaw, since it depends on the wife not checking that he is really dead, something they could not be certain of.The best part was at the very end, where it seems clear that the wife isn't really dead, and is giving payback. I hope she succeeds."
"Les Diaboliques is amongst the greatest thrillers of all time without a doubt, right up there with Psycho, Rear Window and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?. Set and made in France in the 1950's, no other director but Henri-Georges Clouzot himself could have done better, not even the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, who intended on making this film via the novel.Although I did see the 1996 remake first starring Sharon Stone as Nicole and Isabelle Adjani as Mia (Christina in the 1955 version), no one can quite describe the magic this film had in comparison to the remake. The evil atmosphere, the foreign feel, the setting and time it was made make this film so enjoyable to watch. It has wonderful scenery and really fine interior settings.If anything I noticed, it was the amazing lack of music which caused heavy suspense and scares one at moments due to the silent vibes, thus creating almost a realistic feel of being there at the time the character is wandering down dark hallways and through spooky rooms at night. Another thing that stands out is the incredibly amazing cinematography. The art and picture quality used in this film is fantastic, not to mention the fact that this film is in black and white causing more of a spooky atmosphere.Acting and character from actress Simone Signoret is amazing. Her character is very mysterious and yet we get to know who she is and what she is like about twenty minutes into the film. Her character is very likable and has its humorous moments, how her character does not care, how her character hides herself up so well. Her acting is superb and almost masterful.The time I waited to see Les Diaboliques was worth it, making this film more than just another movie I bought from the store, but a masterpiece, a classic in film history. Let it be known that Les Diaboliques is one of the most masterful crafted films ever to be made and one day may its superb elements influence hundreds of directors."
"With ""Les Diaboliques"",Clouzot offered his beautiful and gifted wife, Mrs. Véra Clouzot,and also Charles Vanel and Mrs. Signoret,an imperishable aesthetic existence.This film is one of the finest instances of a director coming with the right stuff at the right time--making an astonishing masterpiece exactly when he was expected to do it--not out of the blue,not unawares--but a purposeful and deliberate and expected for masterpiece.(To give here only 3 examples:Jean Renoir with The River (1951) ,The Golden Coach ,French Cancan (1954) and Elena and Her Men ;Marcel Carné with Children of Paradise and Juliette Ou La clef Des Songes ;Robert Bresson with Au Hasard Balthazar (1966),Mouchette (1967) ,many others;etc.,etc., etc., etc..But I do not wish to seem to imply that this case is exceptional;many examples could be further given:all the great ones, Bergman,Bunuel, Fellini,Mihalkov, Kitano,Tarkovski,etc.).In other words,these are all instances of directors unvanquished by their previous glory and who continued making masterpieces after they became famous.They knew how to score.The glory did not spoil them.""Les Diaboliques"" is one of the best,the most perfect movies I've ever seen.Clouzot,the script,the dialogs,the cast,the cinematography,everything is hugely entertaining.Mrs. Signoret is one of the best and finest actresses that ever lived and worked (I share this passion with my mother!),and an ideal cast.Peter Falk,doing his ""Columbo"",looks almost as if he is a Vanel--wanna-be.Everything is there,in Vanel's Fichet,and Vanel does not need tens of episodes to draw his policeman Falk is good and amusing,etc.,but Vanel did it first,and with genius.Among the most alive policeman roles in movies' history!Mrs. Clouzot is also thrilling to watch,a very accomplished actress....And Clouzot,what a power,what a strength!I would rather see 45 times a Mrs. Signoret movie,than 45 Mrs. Stone movies!(It looks like Mrs. Stone did appear in 70 movies,till now!)I see ""Les Diaboliques"" was given a weighted average vote of 8.4 / 10. Totally unfair and wrong.(Also,there are only 68 comments, fewer that I expected.A shameful bluff like ""Vertigo"" has 387 comments !And that ""Marnie"",106 comments !And even ...""Frenzy"",102 comments !)As far as the suspenseful sinister ,the frankness and the mysteries are concerned,""Les Diaboliques"" is,indeed,related to writers such as Balzac,Barbey d'Aurevilly and the Barbey d'Aurevilly-minded M. Caragiale;that is,the French and French-minded school of mystery.(Barbey d'Aurevilly was highly appreciated by M. Caragiale,RL Stevenson, Bloy,Bernanos). Is it legitimate to make connections between the film's aesthetics,and literature's?Cosasu,at least,did it all the time.In '93,I was thrilled by two French movies.One of them was ""Martin Roumagnac"" (by Lacombe),and the other was ...""The Wages of Fear "",made by the same Henri-Georges Clouzot and starring Yves Montand and ...Charles Vanel (that is ""Alfred Fichet"" from ""Les Diaboliques"").It looks like the 50's were Henri-Georges Clouzot's decade in the French cinema!(In the '50s,3 years after Clouzot,Hitchcock did also a movie based on a Boileau-Narcejac novel;oh,it is in so many ways inferior to ""Les Diaboliques""!)"
"I was intrigued by the title when I first saw this movie. At first I thought the acting good and the story a mystery drama. There was plot changes that did not change that did not make the movie less enjoyable, but it took mystery to another level. I enjoyed how the movie challenged my loyalty to the characters. Even the ending which I thought vague, left the ending up to the viewer,a nd left the door open for a sequel which I am surprised no one has attempted to film. The detective role was excellent, even the role of the children added to the suspense of the film. Of all the remake of films this is one that I feel could stand up to being an excellent film on it's own without standing on the reputation of the original film. There have been remakes of the original film, but none which measure up to the quality of the original for me. The title alone gives me chills. The first time I watched this film I thought the first 1/3 of the film was rather mild for such a terrible title, but by the end of the movie it had earned it's title."
"Diaboliques, Les (known in the US as Diabolique or also The Devils) is one of the greatest suspense films.The acting is solid.Paul Meurisse plays Michel Delasalle a nasty head master of a boys school. He abuses his wife Christina (Vera Clouzot - wife of the director in real life.). Simone Signoret plays Nicole Horner a teacher at the school. Charles Vanel steals the movie as Alfred Fichet a private detective. Vera Clouzot is beautiful as the abused wife and Simone Signoret is also good as her friend.Made in 1955 it was directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. His films are similar to Alfred Hitchcock's and he was known as ""the French Hitchcock."" Clouzot barely beat out Hitch for the rights to The Pierre Boileau novel upon which Dialbolique is based. Hitchcock considered Clouzot a rival and partially made Psycho in order to top Dialbolique. Unfortunately, Clouzot had ill health which diminished his film output. Another great Clouzot film is Wages of Fear (Salaire de la peur, Le (1953) which was remade as Sorcerer by William Friedman. The movie is subtitled but don't let that put you off. You will recognize many scenes in this movie that have been copied over and over in suspense films. This is a film you can see many times and enjoy. By all means avoid the remake of the movie with Sharon Stone which is terrible."
"After seeing the roles that Georges Clouzot had his wife Vera play here and in ""The Wages of Fear"", where her downtrodden character is painfully abused and exploited in just about every scene she's in, I have to wonder just what their home relationship was like.  I don't know what she played in GC's ""Les Espions"", but she doesn't seem to have worked with any other director. There is a very real sadism to ""Les Diaboliques""; the merciless twisting of the screws is shown head on, without respite, which makes watching it riveting, but also apalling."
"This movie is a wonderful thriller about an abused wife and a mistreated mistress who team up to kill the brutal husband. Their plot at first seems like a perfect crime, but then complications start appearing. From the start, the wife's remorse risks revealing the crime, particularly after an inspector shows up. Then the husband's corpse disappears. The mystery and tension build up through the entire film, all the way to the conclusion.The flaws are quite minor, because they don't detract from the suspense at all. One problem is that the ending was a bit too abrupt. An extra minute or two of denouement would have helped.Another problem is that a few early clues in the movie were presented in a way that went a bit too far in misdirecting viewers away from the correct conclusion. A good mystery needs some red herrings, but one should have a bit more chance of recognizing them as misdirection. It would be an inexcusable spoiler to reveal the false clues, avoiding spoilers makes it difficult to explain which clue I mean to those who have seen the movie.A nice touch at the end of the movie is that it has a request on screen asking viewers not to reveal the movie's secrets to people who haven't seen it. It is said to be the first movie to have included such a request.I saw the Criterion DVD version. I'm pleased they selected it, because that's one thing that led me to watch the movie. In spite of the minor flaws I noted, the movie is a suspense classic."
"Les Diaboliques is not only a classic of the genre, it is the blueprint from which so many of today's suspense films use as a guide. Even the great Alfred Hitchcock was inspired by this macabre masterpiece from French director Henri Clouzot. I just finished watching the Criterion DVD of this gem and, although it is not as pristine as some other Criterion offerings, it does represent the best quality you are likely to find of this better than 40-year-old film.There are three reference standard items to watch for in this film. Naturally, the ending is what garners the most attention and the fact that Clouzot originated the idea of asking his audience not to reveal it to other would-be filmgoers. But, the cinematography used here is excellent in all its black and white glory. The opening credit sequence with raindrops splashing on the pavement in the background is captivating. The third item to watch for is the portrayal of the police inspector. Not only is it an uncanny resemblance to Peter Falk in his Columbo character -- this is in fact the very character that inspired Columbo and his idiosyncracies (ie. rumpled look, cigar, seemingly distracted manner).Most people who are students of film or just plain looking for a good suspense flick will not be disappointed in this landmark feature. Don't even think about confusing this with the 90's schlock attempted copy."
"In a talk show interview, Peter Falk (""Columbo"") stated that his ""Columbo"" character was based, for the most part, on the inspector in this film, including the rumpled trenchcoat, cigar, and irritatingly persistent manner."
"This film is totally riveting, and one of the best suspense/mysteries I've ever seen. I was always kept wondering what will happen next, and the plot shifts and turns in clever new directions. There is a suspense sequence involving a search through a darkened house that had me on the edge of my seat, and extremely anxious. You should go for this film if you love the work of directors like John Dahl and Brian de Palma, as I do."
"A suspense that keeps you glued to the edge of your your seat. Superb acting, flawless script, truly ahead of it's time. Highly recommended."
This film is as valuable as some of the best Alfred Hitchcock movies.
"Extremely good combination of horror and suspense, and in the climax, (I forgot her name) actress's reaction was to intense and lool legit. Awesome movie to watch!"
