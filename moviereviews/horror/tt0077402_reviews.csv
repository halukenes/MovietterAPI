"When you want brutal, look no further, but when you also want to see perhaps the greatest of all comic-book movies not based on a comic-book, it's in George Romero's original take on his continuing mythology. It's not just one of the towering horror films, or horror comedies (what will a poor dead fellow do when the escalator starts?!) but one of the great sequels, more ambitious and ass-kicking than its predecessor, with a filmmaker more confident and technically proficient with his abilities.Romero didn't originally want to do *any* sequel to his original 'Night', but after a visit by some friends to a soon-to-open mall nearby his hometown of Pittsburgh, it struck a chord as to who would be coming here – and what so much consumerism in one place would mean. ""Why do they come here?"" one of the four survivors that happens upon this mall swarming with these flesh-eaters asks another. ""This meant something to them. Instinct, maybe. This was an important part of their lives,"" he responds.I don't think necessarily Romero meant to show the film as any sort of 'This is what will happen!"" type of social horror thing. It's more about, this is where we are at NOW, and in that sense, though broader and a whole LOT bloodier, it holds a place right next to a film like Network as one of the magnificent satires of its time and place, and as much about what the public is like. Romero acts as both pessimist and optimist in this world though; past all the chopped limbs, exploding heads (oh yeah!), Tom Savini stunt and make-up and intestines ripped apart, what holds up the film for me is seeing these four characters come to grip with the horror they've made for themselves, holding up in this ""paradise"" of a mall.Balls-to-the-wall horror, social horror, and some genuine paranoid horror stuff (note to self, never try and fire a gun at a single zombie when in a dark room full of electrical wiring and pipes), and plenty of rock and roll attitude, this is a personal favorite and the most entertaining horror film of its time. And the Goblin music soundtrack yummy."
"Dawn of the Dead is George A. Romero's masterpiece - one of the best zombie apocalyptic movies of all time. It is 1978 classic this movie really started the zombie genre. It is been almost 40 years anniversary now since this movie come out. Night of the Living Dead was George A. Romero's first film that really introduced the zombie genre, but this to me really started the zombie praise. This in my opinion is one of the best zombie movies of all time. It is my number 1 favorite zombie movie I love this movie to death and it is one of my personal favorite horror films of all time. This movie is based on a Zombie apocalypse this group find's them self's with this pilot who takes them with the helicopter in the air and they find a shopping mall. There is a perfect place to go in to a ""Zombie Apocalypse."" So they go in to shopping mall and they have every single item in that shopping mall after disposal to use on the zombies. As you can tell it is a very fun movie but more important this movie inspires zombies. Without this movie there wouldn't have been The Walking Dead there wouldn't be 28 Days Later there wouldn't have been any of that. This movie is very important this days it was remade in 2004. It is a fun, fun ride I enjoy this film it is entertaining horror flick. Back in the 1978 that come out it was more scary than it is today. This is where I give this movie the most credit, just like... you have a great time watching people murdering zombies. This movie has a great action, great story, plot, great effects the real zombies. It has gore, blood, you se heads been blowing off. George A. Romero's wrote and direct brilliantly this movie. Tom Savini creates a great special effects for the zombies. Great make up, great blood squibs. The film is fast paced it is excellent brilliant. You see all those SWAT team sieging the building shooting the zombies and gunning the down violent gang. You see whole world comes to an end and people shooting zombies even kids are zombies in this movie. The group in the shopping mall has to deal not only with zombies and the disposing them, they also have to deal with poachers who break in to their home and start stealing items and letting zombies in the mall. Tom Savini was one of the motorcycle poachers who was stealing items in the mall. Gaylen Ross was a fantastic babe as Francine news reporter. David Emge as Stephen the pilot was excellent. Ken Foree as Peter a SWAT team member was the best in this movie. Scott H. Reiniger as Roger another SWAT team member was good in his role. They don't make movies like this today anymore. It's a R-rated movie and it is a perfect 10. Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie apocalyptic movies of all time, I highly recommend this film to any horror fan."
"By turns horrific, hilarious, disgusting and absurd Dawn of the Dead is the work of a director truly on top of his game.  Given almost total control (something which was to be denied Romero in later years) George Romero gives us his unique and vivid view of a world in absolute turmoil.Not just a mockery of the hedonistic and empty America of the late 70's Dawn is also a parable or warning if you like of the brittle structure of society and how easily it can be disintegrated.  Many have criticised the film for being too over the top and questioned the quality of the acting.  This for me is one of the joys of the film, Romero uses gaudy sets and effects and combines this with comic book hero dialogue to lull us into a false sense of security. Then masterfully Romero pulls the rug out from under us and brings the reality of the situation crashing in on our heads.Dawn stands alone well but really comes into its own as part of the trilogy to which it belongs.  One theory of mine is that the Alien trilogy (forgetting the miserable fourth installment) takes a lot from the dead trilogy namely the pace and claustrophobia of the two which book-end the mass hysteria and over the top horror and violence of the middle film.Undoubtedly one of the great Horror films of modern time. Or perhaps there is something about being the only people left alive and living in a shopping mall that appeals to the kid in all of us. 10/10"
"This movie has always been a big favorite of mine. I went through a zombie phase in high school and this is, hands down, the best zombie film ever made. With all the crap coming out today, it still stands out.Dawn is a great satire of materialistic modern society. All of the performances are spot on, George Romero's writing and direction is flawless as usual, and the gore is brilliant. What could be better than a bunch of zombies taking over a shopping mall? That's right, nothing.If you call yourself a horror fan and you haven't seen the original Dawn of the Dead, you need to get with the program immediately! No one messes with Romero, no one!"
"If only every horror movie was made with such determination as this one.  A zombie classic, Dawn of the Dead succeeds in every aspect.  It has enough violence and gore to gratify any horror fan, and then some!  The weird thing is that the gore in this movie isn't unnecessary, it suits the purpose.  In this sequel to the classic Night of the Living Dead, the zombies have taken over the land and have spread to immense numbers.  A group of people escape the carnage in a helicopter, and take refuge in a huge mall where they can live off the supplies inside for years.  They have to fend off the zombies trying to get in, as well as a sadistic group of bikers who want to loot the place.  Great film, lots of gory action and flesh-munching.  Make sure to check out the newly remastered director's cut for terrific picture and sound, and extra footage."
"Dawn of the Dead is concrete proof that extreme gore and violence doesn't always equal a dumb movie and that the two can make very nice bedfellows indeed. This film is a rare thing in that it will please both gorehounds and fans of art cinema, and there isn't a vast amount of films that do that. Aside from doing what I've just mentioned, this follow up to Night of the Living Dead established George Romero as a household name in many a gore fan's home and his trilogy of zombie films will ensure for ever more that the name 'Romero' and the zombie film will always go hand in hand. The plot of this film follows four survivors of the zombie apocalypse that has ensued after the events of Night of the Living Dead as they hold up in a shopping mall to try and hide from the events going on in the outside world. However, this poses another problem, as once their home has been built up in the midst of the atrocities; will our hero's be able to give up all that they have built?The commentary on society and the trappings of consumerism that Romero appears to be keen to implement in his film come off as being somewhat muddled, due to the fact that it's lost under the reality that what we see our hero's doing makes absolute perfect sense. This, however, is where the genius behind the commentary comes into play; it's a depiction of what people within a consumerist society would do in this situation, which makes the commentary all the more potent. Despite it being a film about zombies, Romero implements a sense of realism into the proceedings, which works due to the fact that he never overindulges in anything. Sure, the gore towards the end is over the top; but even that is realistic as it is what you would expect a zombie massacre to be. Because of his sense of realism, we are able to care for the characters that Romero has presented us with, even though we really know little about them. The audience is able to put themselves into their situation and we are constantly given the feeling that we are actually involved in the events on screen. This makes the ending of the movie more potent by way of the sense of security that Romero has lulled you into throughout the movie, and at the end; we really feel for what is happening to our characters and even though we want to see the massacre happen (as that's why we're watching the film at the end of the day), we sort of don't want to see it at the same time. This kind of mind-game isn't carried off successfully very often, but Romero has it down to an art form here.The movie benefits massively from a great score by Dario Argento's house band, Goblin. In fact, with the obvious exception of Suspiria; I would even go as far as to say that this is their best work ever. The score blends so well with the happenings on screen that it's impossible to have one without the other. Some films have a superfluous score, or one that doesn't add anything to the film; but it's undeniable that the score of Dawn of the Dead not only adds to what we're seeing, but 'makes' it. As many people will be tuning in to see gore, I am pleased to tell you that this film doesn't disappoint in that respect. It's one of the goriest films ever made, with many sequences reaching a level of disgustingness that is rarely seen in cinema (intestine dinner, anyone?). As you are probably aware, Tom Savini did the make-up effects for Dawn of the Dead and it is the film that made his career and established him as the gore guru that he is often seen as today. The film is also notable for a certain line that has been quoted more times than any other line uttered in any other horror movie. I am of course talking about the fabulous; ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the Earth"".Dawn of the Dead is undoubtedly one of the most important films ever made. It inspired a barrage of rip-off's that are still being made today and it stands tall on many a horror fan's list of favourite horror films. Dawn of the Dead is one of the most recent films to inspire a remake and, unfortunately, it turned out to be terrible. Not that it matters, as the original is where it's at; and this film is an undeniable masterpiece."
"This review refers to the theatrical cut of the film. When George A. Romero's no-budget horror movie Night of the Living Dead hit screens in 1968, the same year that had already given audiences the all time genre classic Rosemary's Baby, no one could have predicted the indelible effect it would have on the history of cinema. The film introduced audiences to a degree of graphic violence never before witnessed on American screens. However, it was the film's intense, omnipotent terror that forever scarred a generation of viewers. Although the film enjoyed unprecedented mainstream success for an independent production, the filmmakers saw little of the movie's earnings. Romero's string of box office disappointments in the years to follow would diminish his clout in Hollywood, and as such he found it was an uphill battle to fund his ambitious sequel to the film. Then along came Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, hot off the heels of such international blockbusters as Deep Red and Suspiria. Argento helped secure funding for the film, in exchange for the rights to personally oversee the international cut of the film. The collaboration would be a match made in horror movie heaven, for the end product would be Dawn of the Dead, one of the most acclaimed and enduringly popular horror movies of all time. Dawn of the Dead's plot is so effectively simple, and now thoroughly familiar, that it almost goes without description. While the world approaches a still unexplained and ever growing zombie apocalypse, four individuals-two millitary men, a helicopter pilot, and his TV reporter girlfriend-barricade themselves in an abandoned suburban shopping mall. The mall provides fodder not only for the film's well known social commentary, but also for some truly thrilling-if not terrifying-setpieces.With its graphic depictions of human evisceration, exploding heads, and gruesome flesh eating, Dawn of the Dead may well be the goriest American film of all time. The film is actually so violent and gruesome that it was released unrated in the United States for fear of being slapped with an X Rating. That didn't stop the film from being a huge hit at home and abroad. The film earned rave reviews from critics (most famously, from Roger Ebert, who called it `one of the best horror movies of all time'). It instantly became recognized not only as a genre classic, but also as one of the sharpest social satires of the decade, with its often hilarious commentary on an ever growing consumer culture embodied by the film's mall location.Internationally, the film was even bigger. The movie was released in a special 117 minute cut overseas (the US theatrical version was 120 minutes) which was edited by Dario Argento and featured a more prominent presentation of the soundtrack by rock band Goblin as well as a much faster overall pace. Released in most countries as `Zombie: Dawn of the Dead' or `Zombies', it was so big in Italy that the following year Lucio Fulci, previously a director of `giallo' thrillers, helmed a gory semi-sequel. His `Zombie 2', released in the US as `Zombie', would become one of the most popular drive in hits of the 1970s, a massive international success that solidified the zombie/cannibal craze of the early 1980s and sparked Lucio Fulci's own reign as a horror movie icon. Dawn of the Dead is a truly stunning example of the horror genre's ability to produce works that are as socially relevant as they are terrifying, films which break free of the constraints of conventional horror movie elements and in doing so establish themselves as being truly timeless. While I would still give Night of the Living Dead the slight edge between the two, Dawn of the Dead is still an extraordinary film in its own right as well as an almost superior sequel to another of the scariest movies ever made."
"Thoughtful if unsubtle epic follow-up to Night of the Living Dead was one of THE influential movies of the late 70's; pity, then, that the people it influenced paid more attention to the amped-up gore than to the sense of contained hysteria that makes what should be tough going (there are basically three scenes in this movie: zombies attack people, people attack zombies, people stand around talking) a uniquely involving and provocative self-analysis of the zombie film.The symbolism is, well, not delicate. Just in case we missed it the first time, the trope that the mall attracts the zombies ""because it was an important place to them"" is repeated for our rumination. But the overall sustained atmosphere, inside and outside of the banal environment of the shopping mall, is by far the film's salient contribution; even when there is no obvious action onscreen, there is the threat of an attack to come, and the clock is clearly ticking on the four protagonists during their idyll. Moreover, it takes the conspicuously familiar and catapults it into an apocalyptic situation, creating a powerful sense of displacement.The violence, which is primarily what draws people to or repels them from this movie, comes on strong, but quickly becomes monotonous (as it is, the vast majority of the violence in the movie is inflicted against the zombies rather than by them, though is none the less repulsive for that); the scariest part of the movie is how plausible it makes the concept of total disintegration of what we perceive as civilization. The soundtrack, highlighting pulsing, insistent synthesizer chords, contributes much to the onscreen tension, which the action choreography is exemplary. An unlikely masterpiece."
"'Dawn of the dead' may lack the pulverising immediacy of 'Night of the Living Dead', but it gains in exhilirating, epic scope.  It is one of the best films of the 1970s, a reckless, hubristic, over-ambitious masterpiece whose excess is reined in by its Langian formal precision.  The claustrophobia of the first film is replaced by a wider frame of reference, including the media, the military and suburbia; although, typically, the move is once again towards the indoors.The film starts explosively, inside a panicking TV station trying to report on the inexplicable emergence from the earth of the undead.  An assorted quartet - two media, two army; three white, one black; three men, one woman - escape in a helicopter used for rush-hour traffic reports.  There is a sense of relief in this, a sense of breaking free from the circle of undead enclosing America's major cities.But not for long - it seems that modern American man, unlike his pioneering ancestors, cannot stand open spaces, and holes up in a building, a shoppingmall, which is crawling with zombies, and recognised by the woman as a prison.  Not content with this level of confinement, our heroes draw plans, erect barriers, shut down grids.  Romero pinpoints this national insularity by framing his modern horror movie as a transposed Western, with the foursome as latterday frontiersmen wiping out the natives, and erecting a new civilisation.Some might say that Romero's irony is a little heavy here - the mock-triumphal Western music on the soundtrack; the composition of the four at the height of the crisis standing in front of a sign with just the letters 'U' and 'S' visible; the glee in the gun culture, including an ersatz Western gun store in the mall the 'Red River' like beseiging  of the mall by the 'Indian' Hells' Angels on their motorbike/horses complete with tomahawks.  But such irony is never stable - Romero keeps pulling the ground from under the viewers' feet, both in terms of character identification, and the shifting meanings embodied by the zombies.Romero's terrifying vision is of an America turned in on itself, eating itself through cannibalistic greed, the very system of capitalism based on a cycle of power and repression in which the repressed will never quite go away.  'Night' pulsated with a late 1960s urgency reflecting contemporary social and political upheaval, white capitalist America beseiged by the peoples it had oppressed for centuries.  By 1978, that political anger is gone, and America has reverted to being a race of consumer zombies, congregating around massive shopping malls like they're the religious temples of the Incas, trapped there not by the freedom of choice of capitalist propaganda, but mindless instinct.the zombies are supposed to be the enemy, the Other in conventional horror terms, but the first thing the so-called heroes do on landing at the mall is substitute urgent survival for gleeful consumerism (compare with the very similar silent fantasy, 'Paris Qui Dort').  There's no way to deal with any outside threat because we are numbed and bloated by products.  Reality ceases to exist; there are some beautifully surreal scenes, as our heroes make homes in showrooms.The mall sequence as a whole has a Bunuellian savagery about it, and the film builds up an aggression like the characters until all is chaos - tones, modes, genres all colliding, the 'reality' or 'integrity' or, even, 'seriousness' of the film as much in question as the modern world the protagonists live in, where even time seems to stand still, the weeks of the action compressed into the framework of a day, with the night of the living dead giving onto the dawn.  It is probably allegorically significant which characters survive, but by the end we're not sure whether we're watching a horror, a comedy, a thriller, a Western, or a very bitter joke.  Certainly scarier than 'The Stepford Wives'"
"Dawn of the Dead- ****/****George A. Romero's masterful classic is least of anything a film about zombies. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is thinly disguised as a zombie gore flick, but it is really three things. 1. A cultural statement portraying racism, angst, counter-culture and degradation. 2. An account of human bonding and human reaction to different environments, harsh and eclectic. 3. Least of this trio, it is a black comedy. Rather, it contains dark comedic elements. Somewhere early along in the film, I looked past the initial plot of four strangers hiding in a mall from hordes of zombies swarming the world, as the government attempts to find a solution to the chaotic massacres. Peter Washington (Ken Foree) is the strong, black, courageous SWAT team member who rises above the other three protagonists to become their leader. Steven Andrews (David Emge) is the  somewhat timid and hesitant traffic reporter, lover of the pregnant Francine (Gaylen Ross). Ostensibly hapless and useless, Francine is actually a valuable aide to the quartet. Last, is the resourceful and daring Roger (Scott H. Reiniger).From where I left off, I overlooked the premise of the quartet defending themselves from hordes of flesh-eating monsters and instead saw thoroughly fleshed out character personalities, bonds, and interactions. Throughout the movie's length, we learn to genuinely love these guys; Roger is so smooth and fun, easily likeable, Peter is quiet, warm-spirited, and reliable, Steven and Francine are charming. We knows them like our friends and heroes, so when they are attacked by the ferocious zombies, the suspense is so nerve-wracking and our hearts beat so rapidly because we really care about the four protagonists and could not bear to watch them die. They started off as strangers and parted as companions. Also, it is very interesting to watch how they monopolized the mall, how, in the beginning, they slept on cold hallway floors, constantly keeping watch. Later, they eliminated the threat, dined in the mall's fancy restaurant, ice skated on the mall's link, visited the gun shop for weapons, slept in rooms with beds, dressers, televisions, and other luxuries. This is an accurate representation of how it is human nature to manipulate and survive through alien atmospheres. I found that vision ingenious. Another brilliant message the film brings attention to regards the 1970-decade. I found that like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Dawn of the Dead"" captures the spirit of its era. The racism, tumult, riots, counter-culture, degradation are all well represented here. The film shows SWAT teams, complete with racist officers, who kill for fun, raiding an unruly group of Hispanics and Blacks, hillbillies heading out in troops to battle zombies for sport, mercenaries and vigilantes running wild, all events indistinguishable from incidents in the 70's. Perhaps the most disturbing and ironic ""70's incident"" in the movie involves raiding gangs of bikers who explode into the mall, mirthfully slaughtering zombies (not that that is an offense) and vandalizing stores, stealing jewelry, guns, clothes, and everything they can find; whereas our heroes took only their necessities. What happens next is very scathingly satirical and ironic. In between the battle for the survival of the human species, the bikers find it necessary to start their own little civil war amongst the not-so-numerous survivors. They hunt down both zombies and our good guys; a perfectly timed paradoxical and cynical scene. Just like the battles between non-conformists and conventionalists during the 1970's and 1960's, when America was on the brink of disaster, this cinematic revolution is hard-hitting, gut wrenching, and very real. One fascinating facet of the movie is how the audience learns to disregard the now ""minor"" threat of the slow-moving zombies (a bullet or incision to the head will do the job). At this point, one would not even notice that this film had the slightest relevance to the horror genre. Instead, we fear the vicious bikers, a bigger threat, villains with swords and guns. This time, the suspense and uneasiness detonates, for there is a much greater chance of death for the heroes. I found the scariest part of the movie was the deterioration of the planet during the zombie apocalypse; how the human species' decline is morbidly presented effectively and expertly by George A. Romano. However, a refreshing sense of black humor is tossed in towards the middle of the film. Zombies attempt to walk up escalators, ice skate, and explore their surroundings, with chuckles as the result of their clumsiness. One biting laugh comes when Steven explains to Francine why all these creatures have returned to the mall.  ""Instinct, memory. This was an important place in their lives,"" he points out. And of course, there are many, many thrills and chills. This film isn't very ""jump-out-from-the dark-with-a-chainsaw"" scary, but more disturbing and extremely tense, because we actually care about our characters and don't want them to die. The movie is unpredictable in this aspect, unlike slashers where you are guessing who the one survivor is and how the others die. As the zombies close in, we plead, ""Don't die, don't die!"" I have two minor complaints with this film. My biggest one is that the movie seems to carry on forever, the way ""Goodfellas"" did. Despite the brilliance I felt enraptured with, I kept asking myself, ""When will this movie end?!?"" However, I realize that Romano could not have trimmed any more scenes  without damaging the potency of his work. Also, the gore was at times just too much. For instance, the exploding head scene was revolting, and most of all, the intestinal feeding scene when a biker is torn apart was repulsive; I couldn't watch as his guts were graphically shown ripping apart.Aside from those two unfortunate aspects, I strongly encourage you, rather you HAVE to, watch ""Dawn of the Dead."" Thrilling and suspenseful thanks to extremely distinct characters, whose fate you hope a happy one, and grippingly socially relevant, this is a unique horror, or really of all genres, treasure."
"There's not much use denying it George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is one of the chosen few, absolute greatest horror films ever made and it's fairly unimaginable that a powerful movie like this will ever come out again. Even more than its 1968 predecessor, the landmark known as ""Night of the Living Dead"", this film contains literally everything to satisfy even the most demanding fan of horror cinema. Some films attempt to reach a maximum level of high tension throughout; some have eminent directors and/or a professional cast; some horrors will distinguish themselves from the rest by providing a lot of gore & gruesome make-up effects and others completely rely on uniquely atmospheric set pieces and filming locations. ""Dawn of the Dead"" consists of ALL these trademarks and yet a whole lot more! This film more or less begins where ""Night"" ended, with an alarming increase of zombies that feast their way through America. The opening sequences masterfully capture the growing sense of mass hysteria and disbelief in a TV-studio, where a 'scientist' warns the population not to regard these walking corpses as former family members or friends, but as mere monsters on the constant lookout for human flesh to feed on. These scenes introduce Peter and Francine, who plan to escape the big city in a helicopter. Cut to another very perplexing series of action sequences in which fellow policemen Stephen & Peter battle their way through a zombie-infested apartment building. Eventually these four characters flee together and entrench themselves in a large shopping mall complex. They can fairly easily handle the menace of the zombies here, but the biggest danger comes from typical human greed and selfishness. It's downright amazing how Romero manages to present such an implausible topic like zombie mayhem in such a realistic and incredibly disturbing way. He already did that in ""Night of the Living Dead"" but ""Dawn"" is entirely different film all together, since it contains a lot more humor and intelligently subtle society-mockery. The gore is sensational and plentiful (thank you, Tom Savini!) but the film never at one point drags in the tension or bad editing department. It's just, in one word, the perfect horror movie. There exist more than a dozen different versions of this film, which are all worth seeing at least once if only to spot the differences. Particularly recommended are Romero's original director's cut (duh!!) and Argento's European cut. This latter cuts a little on the dialogues and humor, but it features another brilliant soundtrack by Goblin! I could easily write another five page-essay about the genius of this movie, but it would just constantly re-confirm that it's absolute must-see! In case you haven't yet, make ""Dawn of the Dead"" a priority and also make sure you've got the horror-munchies!"
"After being introduced to ""Halloween,"" I was introduced to other horror movies for which I heard my peers talked about in school and after watching this movie on the movie channel, I was introduced to something more gruesome than anything else. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the sequel to the popular cult ""Night of the Living Dead"" in which two national guards, a reporter and a pilot have escaped Philadelphia on a chopper after finding out that the whole globe has been affected with zombies resurrecting from the dead and attacking the living. The four of them hide out in a deserted mall where they think everything is safe until they realize that the reporter is pregnant and that they're zombies invading the mall. After exterminating the zombies, the survivors make the mall their own home where they shop for food, steal the cash and turn a small room into a personal resting place. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is by far one of the best horror films and sequels I have ever seen. It's dark, mean and much more violent than the original black and white horror film."
"Dawn of the Dead is a brilliant film.  You gotta love those zombies. I loved the bit where one of the bikers arm got stuck in the blood pressure machine and the zombies ate him alive.  If you're going to see it, make sure it is the Director's Cut."
"Never, in my years as a horror fan have i found a review that has given good reason to why this film is sub-par. And only twice in my entire life have i found anyone who has disliked this movie ( one of which being my sister ). The film is one of the most intelligent horror films ever made. It quite cynically shows that we as a society would crumble in a situation such as this for the reason that we would more be fighting each other than the enemy at hand. Also it pretty much documents the rise of consumerism, in two ways:one, the characters feel that they are just fine as long as they have these material things, two, the zombies come back in instinct. This was one of the most important pars of their normal lives, & they try endlessly to get in. The story ( if you don't already know it) concerns a group of survivors, 2 swat team members, 2 television station employees ) steal a traffic helicopter & take to the skies to find a safer place of refuge. After a day of danger & no luck, they stumble upon a shopping mall. They hole up in a sort of emergency shelter in the roof, & slowly begin to make the mall theirs. Once they have cleared all the zombies out of the mall, they live like french kings, living it up while the poor starve outside their ""castle"". But a looting biker gang brakes their way in, & our main protagonists try to fight for what they have successfully stolen. The makeup is top notch, (i like blue-faced zombies), the gore is awesome, the music, catchy is an under statement, every little thing about this film is excellent. No matter what others may say, DAWN OF THE DEAD , will always the biggest cult phenomenon for decades, maybe even centuries to come."
"The original ""Dawn of the Dead"" is one of the most stunningly original and timeless movies in the history of cinema, not to mention horror cinema. As time goes on, it will be one day be regarded as a classic American film. It's almost there...If it weren't for the sad excuse of a remake (as most of them are) that came out a few years back, I think 2004, it may not have risen to such popularity so quickly as of late. But, hey, thanks to the talentless human who remade this masterpiece, millions of kids the world over have discovered the original, the one and only. And it's as cool today as it was when it came out. The stuff legends are made of, really.""Dawn of the Dead"" is to horror movies as ""Gone With the Wind"" is to drama movies. It was not the first zombie flick, and certainly won't be the last, but the precision with which Romero, Argento, and the rest of the gang hit the nail on the head with this one will never be matched, even with a budget ten times the size.If you haven't seen it, see it. If you don't dig it, you don't deserve to watch horror movies. This one is an absolute winner.10 out of 10, kids."
"OK I just got done watching this and it was great this is the first movie I have seen in the United States Of America that I had not seen in the United Kingdom I have seen ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" I just never seen the Euoropean version under the tittle ""ZOMBI"" instead of the tittle ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" this is the version done by Dario Argento and it was great I liked it a lot more than the other versions the music in this was different and the sound effects are different and there are some different scenes than the other version I first saw about a year or two ago. If you have not seen this version you should check it out it is really good and maintains all of it great and bloody gore scenes it has almost all ways has had."
"This film is the zombie movie to end all zombie movie never will there be a film that will match the leering sense of doom that flows from this cinematic classic. I first read of this film while reading a Fangoria 12 yrs ago. I rented it just because the article captivated me. Also it said the movie was a sequel to NOTLD. Upon the first time watching it I was shocked. If there ever was to be a Zombie apocalypse this is what it would look like. The movie begins with a frantic news station that cant hold itself together with the unfold events. Then a SWAT team dukes it out with project patrons and zombies. Then 2 SWAT members and 2 news people high tail it in a stolen traffic copter. Their journey to find safety shows the world crumbling. National guard, rednecks, cops,etc. are shown trying to stop it. Then they land on a mall barricade it and well shop or steal or whatever. All seems fine and dandy until a army of looters on motorcycles show up to get a piece of the conquest which turns the mall into a literal war-zone between the good guys, bad guys and zombies. This movie has buckets of blood to accompany the painful deaths. Romero does an excellent job with the atmosphere. The characters are fine actors as well as the zombies. This film seems be a vividly realistic depiction of a state of an emergency. Watch this film don't watch the remake this is what a zombie move should be not super female clones lopping of heads and fighting dead dogs and birds. Just normal people trying to survive in a world of the dead. WARNING: I do stress not for the weak stomached."
"I can't say enough good things about this movie! They accomplished so much with such a small budget and manage to evoke so many different emotions from viewers throughout you can be nothing short of amazed by the finished product. Legendary filmmaker George A. Romero (""Night of the Living Dead"") has with ""Dawn"" created the most ambitious and most satisfying movie of his entire career. It's apocalyptic horror time as four survivors; policemen Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger), female newscaster Francine (Gaylen Ross) and her husband Stephen (David Emge) take off in helicopter looking for a safe haven. The world's being destroyed by a plague of sorts, which takes shape as quickly-multiplying flesh eating living dead. One little bite and you will be joining them as they aimlessly shuffle along looking for their next meal. These zombies have taken over not only rural areas (where they began in ""Night""), but also urban areas, and society as a whole is in the process of completely collapsing. Our four reluctant heroes decide if they're going to survive, they need to get as far away from civilization as possible. On their way to wherever (via helicopter), they end up stopping to refuel at a shopping mall and decide it's the perfect place to hide out for a while; seeing how they have all the resources right in one place. They kill all the zombies inside, clear the place out, barricade the doors and try to live as normal a life as possible until they decide what their next move is going to be. The movie plays out impressively in the brilliant mall setting and emerges as intelligent, horrific, exciting and comedic (from the slyest of satire to the most overt of slapstick). It succeeds on so many different levels that people who really don't even enjoy horror films all that much should like it, and yet there's a wealth of scares, suspenseful scenarios and bloody Tom Savini gore effects to keep the horror fans thoroughly entertained. ""Dawn"" is not just a horror classic, but a full fledged cinematic masterpiece in my opinion, and a movie any serious film buff needs to see."
"George A. Romero's epic sequel to his classic Night of the Living Dead (1968) is an equally classic, and equally excellent film!As the zombie plague sweeps the nation, four refugees escape to a shopping mall where they plan to hide out. But how long can they keep out the ravenous flesh-eaters or the outside world?With it's great direction, satirical humor, gripping story, and merciless gore, Dawn of the Dead ranks as one of the greatest horror films of the 70's. Romero makes not only a terrific horror picture, but a clever social commentary with this film as he compares the zombies to the every-day shopper! He well-laces this film with action, humor, emotion, and an effective sense of adventure even in the face of such grueling terrors. Makeup artist Tom Savini does some of his most memorable work in this film, creating some unforgettably stomach-churning gore. I swear I couldn't eat my breakfast the morning after I first saw this film!! The band Goblin provides a weird, but very appropriate music score. Who could ever forget that wonderful mall muzak?Stars David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross do some excellent performances. They make their characters well-drawn and likable.An outstanding film period. Required viewing for horror fans!**** out of ****"
"Simply put, the greatest horror film ever made, and one of the greatest films ever made period! A class act all around, even at its goriest. I don't wish to spoil anything for you by dodging around the plot or any of the wonderful things you can get out of this film, and will continue to get from repeated viewings. It is an aesthetic triumph which has no equal: one of the most filmic, and delightful productions ever made. Like all great works of art, it is the apex of its genre as well as transcendent of its genre. Do not read the back-of-the-case blurb, do not read semi-critical reviews you must watch this film and decide for yourself. A short premise is all you need: The dead roam the earth, killing those they find. Those they kill get up and kill. It is the end of the world. We're down to the line. 4 people try to survive by fighting with the ghouls for control of large mall which could perhaps sustain them indefinitely and protect them from the hungry, but mindless hordes of flesh eating zombies shambling in the parking lot if they can contend with those already inside! Will humanity survive though death reigns? Are the greater threats outside, or inside? There are 3 great horror and sci-fi trilogies in film. One is Star-Wars, one is Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and the greatest is Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead. Dawn of the Dead is the most well rounded and exceptional of the trilogy. Dawn of The Dead is about race. Dawn of The Dead is about class. Dawn of The Dead is about America. Dawn of The Dead is about death. Dawn of The Dead is about life. Dawn of The Dead is about consumerism. Dawn of The Dead is about humanity. Dawn of The Dead is about violence. Dawn of The Dead is about domesticity. Dawn of The Dead is about individuals. Dawn of The Dead is about society. Dawn of The Dead is funny. Dawn of The Dead is brutally serious. Dawn of The Dead is about great film making, made by the combined effort of a dedicated and revolutionary team with the power to take the taboo and make it golden. Even on a purely superficial level, these effects are brilliant, filmic, and artisticmuch more so than anything cgi (though still light years behind the effects used in Day of The Dead.) Like a Shakespearean play, Dawn of the Dead has something for the aristocrats, middle-class, and groundlings, and in that, it proves that we all share a common experience. It is just that magnificent. Some people will call this ""satire,"" and others ""camp,"" but really there's so much more to it! I encourage you to watch this movie repeatedly, because I know you'll get something different from it each time!Warning: Do not watch this film if you 1. have strong predispositions against gore, 2. strongly dislike parables or satires 3. cannot abide movies from the 70's. Warning: If you do not meet any of the qualifications above, then you cannot afford to miss this film! ((A perfect 100%. One of those rare and precious jewels. A unique and fitting work of art, both perfect for its time and timeless. When this film premiered the audience was chanting in the street. If you have even one romantic bone if your body, you will LOVE Dawn of The Dead.))"
"That's how I'd describe this movie's rabid fan-base and the ridiculous, outrageous claims they make to defend this steaming pile of reeking excrement. How in the world can something like this be called great satire? Dr. Strangelove is great satire. American Psycho is great satire. Borat is great satire. Dawn of the Dead is not. Dawn of the Dead is an endless amount of toxic waste washing over your TV screen for two excruciating hours. It's a complete insult to anyone with even the slightest bit of intelligence. Ooooh, the zombies are returning to the mall because that's where they spent most of their life! THAT IS SO DEEP! Someone hand George A. Romero a Most Brilliant Man Ever Honorary Award already! How in the world can this be considered great horror? The Shining is great horror. The Omen is great horror (the original, not that comatose slap in the face of a remake that came out last year). Audition is great horror. Casper the Friendly Ghost is great horror compared to this... this... thing! I'd rate DOTD among such classics as Saw III and Freddy's Dead. Let's look at the facts: The acting is awful. It's not ""realistic"" or ""natural"", it's awful. There's a reason most of the cast members never had much of a career after DOTD - they're completely, indescribably, hopelessly pathetic. But hey, I can't blame them since they don't have much to work with... did this movie even have a script? I could actually *feel* my brain dying as the inept cast read their mind-numbing lines and got into life-threatening situations over and over again for no reason except to kill time and because of their own pitiable stupidity.About the zombies themselves... well, imagine the scariest movie you've ever seen, multiply it by a billion, and you're still not even close to how frightening the zombies would have been if they weren't so laughably shitty. Blue makeup sloppily applied to random patches of drunk extras' faces does not equal horror. Period. When I see a horror movie I don't want to watch retards get chased around a mall by giant Smurfs moving at a snail's pace for two full hours.This is amateur hour with pink gore. It's not scary or atmospheric, not intelligent and most certainly not entertaining. It's a classic - I'll give it that. But it's a classic that I wouldn't recommend to any fan of film, ever, and I'd rather pluck out my fingernails one by one with a wrench than watch this wretched atrocity of cinema again.Oh, I'm just kidding you guys! I actually love this movie and was just pulling your leg! I mean, how could anyone look at the pie-throwing scene or at Peter jumping around screaming ""yeeeee-haaaaw"" repeatedly for half a minute and NOT exclaim: ""this is the epitome of cinematic perfection!"" See what I mean? This is pure genius, I tell you, pure genius!! See the 2004 version instead. Edit: At the time of this writing, only 1 out of 5 people share my awesome opinion, while 4 are upset because they can't admit to themselves that I'm telling the truth."
"10 years after Night of the living dead Romero's greeting us with this magnificent sequel. I won't say whether this is better than Night though, because they are very different films. Both great. This is the one that inspired all those modern zombie movies. It was quite popular in Europe, inspiring many Spanish and especially Italian zombi flicks (Fulci, Lenzi...). Not to mention the Resident Evil video games. What to say, that already hasn't been mentioned. The whole film is quite an experience. From start to finish it has been a great ride. Romero's direction is great. The soundtrack, the acting's fine. Great make-up and special effects. Savini truly did a great job here. This is maybe the best thing about the film. The gore effects are very well done. I would say grab some beers, sit back, relax and watch those mindless zombies getting killed."
"Having been impressed with this movie since first seeing it in the early eighties on video I feel compelled to write a review of the reviews on IMDB, it deservedly gets a high score, with 10 out of 10 user reviews one after the other, until you hit the spate of 1 out of 10 reviews. Who are these people? Surely they're not movie fans, the big problem with the internet is that you see everybody's opinion, including those of blithering idiots. Some people are even complaining about the zombies not running about after people! I blame this modern idea of zombies, the DOTD remake and 28 Days Later etc. They aren't zombie films, dead people running about whilst they slowly decompose is just stupid. The fear is in that even though they only shuffle about they are so vast in number that there is no escape no matter where you run, they only have that burst of speed when they're close to the victim in true zombie films. The idea is that you can escape for a while and try to avoid them, but eventually they close in and get you. The exciting parts of this movie work because they don't move fast, allowing the protagonists to do things that fill the film with interesting possibilities, like what would it be like to live in a shopping mall with no customers and nobody charging you for anything? It's a black comedy about consumerism and it wouldn't work if all those zombies ran around like Olympic athletes, making for quick deaths and desperate hiding as seen in the remake, it took the fun out of it."
"Seriously, is it? I mean, it is hard to find another movie like 'Dawn of the Dead'. Whether it is or not I can't tell but it is definitely one of the most influential movies ever made. Many living dead movies have copied George A. Romero's Living Dead Trilogy and among the three I find it hard to decide which is best, 'Night of the Living Dead' or 'Dawn of the Dead'. But anyway I found myself liking this movie more and more as time passes and it keeps getting better and better with each viewing. With 'The Walking Dead' being one of the most popular series in our modern times, I can't help but think 'Dawn of the Dead' was far ahead of its time. Many of the gimmicks in 'The Walking Dead' have surely been inspired by this movie. The relationship between characters, the way tension is built, the way the living dead behaves, people's tendency to murder each other even at the face of extinction. I can mention more similarities but let us concentrate on the movie, genre: horror, themes: society, culture, extinction, survival, year of release: 1978, director/writer: George A. Romero, main characters: Stephen, Peter, Roger and Francine.Plot: Four survivors trying to survive in a shopping mall amidst a living dead apocalypse. Summary: Peter and Roger escapes in a helicopter with pilot Stephen and journalist(?) Francine. After some time of flying around they inhabit a shopping mall which they clear out of the living dead and starts living a life isolated from the rest of the world. Now the strength of the movie is the relationship between the characters. Without it the demise of the characters would have had less impact. What happens to the characters gives me goosebumps and fills me with dread at the end. One of the other things that gives the movie strength is atmosphere. Usually movies in this genre tend to be more driven by gore and violence with little to no atmosphere with characters you do not care about. The atmosphere in this movie is full of dread and full of a sense of imminent doom. But it also has sense of humor, comic book style. Almost like a parody, ""What are they doing? Why do they come here? "", ""Some kind of instinct. Memory of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives"" was part of the dialogue on top of the mall between Francine and Stephen.At that point the director was comparing shoppers at shopping malls to zombies. Although not originally natural to us it had become so common within society shopping malls became an important part of society's life. It is a social commentary, where shoppers go to shopping malls without wondering why and never seem to question why they go there in the first place. Like mindless zombies, controlled by black magic or what we usually call Voodoo. So although the movie on the surface seems like just another horror movie, it really isn't. It appears to be more like a study and questioning of society's modern culture. Anyway, the movie is magnificently directed by George A. Romero and the cast acts amazingly too. So amazing I find it to get better and better after each viewing. It also has a big influence on modern culture, from the first Resident Evil game to The Walking Dead. I am 25 years old and I find it a little sad people from my generation doesn't recognize the importance of this movie, simply because it is old, because the blood looks fake, because the acting isn't like today and it is not a fast paced movie full of explosions and gunfights with zombies. Like the okay-at-best remake of Dawn of the Dead from 2004. I am tempted to say society's standards have degenerated like the living dead in this movie, but that is just my opinion.P.S. I once watched the German version DVD and it took away all the gory violence, which is sad since the violence is part of the movie's charm. A small plus to the atmosphere and relationship between the characters. Awesome movie."
"With Dawn of the Dead, George Romero proves that you don't need to create a high budget, CGI movie that tries way too hard to scare an audience, when what really scares someone is a feeling of hopelessness without a way out. Before delving into this film, I have really only watched one zombie film which was 28 Days Later and I once I finally got to watch this film, I was stoked especially after hearing all the praise through the years.And I have to say this movie exceeded my expectations. Despite the low budget, it was not at all a detriment to the movies quality. Although slow in movement, zombies can be quite a problem when their numbers are high. There is a great deal of suspense in this movie bound to entertain even the casual movie fan, but what I really loved about this film is its uniqueness and what I'm specifically talking about is what can add weight to a horror film in my opinion.What I am talking about is its setting. Having the movie take place in a shopping mall is complete utter genius. While it not only adds a fun factor (and a few comedic elements), it also feels very isolated and claustrophobic. The setting also creates unique scenarios that the characters must adapt to by thinking of what to do in order to protect themselves, but what it really accomplishes with having a mall infested with zombies is serving as a perfect backdrop to modern society.The film satirizes bourgeious culture perfectly and having it be a zombie is what, in my humble opinion, makes it awesome. Never have I envisioned a horror film work like this from different angles. This movie will entertain those looking for an enjoyable film to watch casually, but it will also be appreciated by the forward thinkers. A must have for any film fanatic's collection. Classic."
"A whole lot of people like Dawn of the Dead, and that's fine.  If it's your favorite movie, then good for you-- your opinion is every bit as valid as mine or anyone else's.  But just to break the monotony of the almost universally positive user comments for this film, I now contribute my opinion.  Dawn of the Dead is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. It left me stunned and speechless and thoroughly convinced it was the worst film of all time; I've since seen worse movies (like George Romero's Knightriders and the Night of the Living Dead remake), but my distaste for Dawn remains unchanged.  It is pointless, sloppy, unrealistic garbage that drags on and on despite numerous moments when they could easily have ended the film and shown everyone mercy.  But no, they have to tack on more plot developments (like the biker gang that randomly shows up) just so we can suffer for another half hour.  And the main characters are too stupid for us to relate with them-- one of them doesn't even know what a mall is, and then they steal money from the bank even though civilization has fallen apart and they can just take whatever they want from the mall anyway.  The acting is equally awful, particularly the helicopter pilot and the bikers.  Mix in some painfully obvious continuity mistakes (the disappearing zombies next to the exploding car, the scene where Roger gets drenched in zombie blood that vanishes in the next shot) and you've got one of the few genuinely awful movies.  Films like this achieve a kind of dark grandeur-- it's not easy to make movies this bad, but somehow Romero pulls it off again and again (something must have happened to him right after he made the great original Night of the Living Dead).  Odds are you'll probably like this film for whatever reason everybody else has for liking it.  But if you watch it and hate every stupid, repulsive moment, take comfort-- you're not alone."
"This has got to be one the most boring, lack luster, truly horrible horror movies I have ever seen. This film did not scare me nor did ever thrill me. Maybe I expectations were too high or maybe simply I read to many fan reviews online and they over-hyped it. Whatever the case was this film is simply terrible. How did this film ever become a classic?The first thing that is wrong with this movie is the slow moving zombies. Zombies that chase after you at .001 miles per hour is hardly scary. It is so easy to escape slow moving zombies that I wonder how on earth you could make 3 movies in a row where the zombies are the antagonist. The zombies are so dull and boring that not even the characters in the film are scared of them.There are so many scenes in this movie where a character would see a zombie coming at him/her and they would show this look of mild concern. Whenever a zombie would charge someone that person would casually and calmly load their gun, take aim, and shoot. This is a lesson all film makers should learn. If the characters in the movie aren't scared of the villains whoever he, she, it may be, then the audience won't be scared. If the characters are going to casually, and easily, dispose of the zombies then I am not as hell sure going to feel scared whenever I see one.The make up & gore effects in this film is quite simply a joke. Maybe at the time they were top of the line & state of the art. But now I look at them and I simply laugh at the cheesiness of it. Tom Savini is a great make up artist. I know because I've seen his work elsewhere like in the Firday the 13th movies. I don't know if the lousy effects were a result of low budget or lack of talent at the time. The blood in the movie is orange for god sake. You think the least they would be able to pull off is real looking blood and not blood that looks like concentrated orange juice.This film is also known for its symbolism & stabs at the American consumer society. How on this earth this film ever got that reputations is beyond me. There is one, count them one, line making a stab at American consumers. It is when the characters first land on the mall roof and they begin to wonder why there are so many zombies there. One character remarks that it is probably because those people spent so much time there that it becomes almost instinct. Thats it. That is where this film get its fame for insulting consumers. Its all because of one quick, non-important, non plot related, line.I will never understand why this film has managed to stand the test of time. I can possibly see why this film might have been scary when it was first released. But looking at it now I am amazed its not under comedy isle in the video stores."
"I don't understand how this movie can be rated to highly. Maybe it has got a large cult following? That must be it! Anyway, don't be fooled by the high ratings, this movie is rubbish from start to end! I starts with an annoying scene set in a TV studio. It's just chaos! It then switches to a scene where a SWAT team storms a building without any explanation. From the start, it's clear that ""acting"" is very bad i this movie! Also, the zombie make-up and blood just looks stupid! There's no horror here. As I watched this movie (I had to turn it off two times because it was so boring), I found myself sitting in disbelief with an open mouth wondering what on earth the director and script writer had been thinking. Everything just seems stupid and without reason. Take the scene where the two SWAT guys race around the parking lot in vans while ""flyboy"" is circling overhead in his helicopter. There's no explanation for this scene whatsoever. What were they doing racing around in the parking lot? Why was the helicopter overhead? Got no clue! At a point during the last 15 minutes, the whole thing becomes so surrealistic and bad that it's almost funny. But make no mistake. This is not fun! This is terrible, and one of the worst movies ever! The only good thing to be said about this movie is, that it spawned a remake in 2004 which is actually pretty good!"
"CAUTION: Possible spoilersBefore I watched this horrible atrocity, I didn't expect it to be good and what I saw scarred me for life. In this movie, the main characters get locked in a zombie-infested mall. I was saying to myself ""how are they going to survive?"" But that question was answered by the characters using guns and fists to easily defeat any zombie that got close to them. Horror movies are good when there is lots of suspense, this movie had none! The characters were killing zombies left and right without any fight back! Also, in the middle of the movie, the characters attempt to live normal lives in the mall while the zombies were still in mall as well. Theres even a poorly done love story in this part. Toward the end of the movie, a motorcycle gang comes in and slaughters the zombies. This scene was supposed to represent human cruelty because the motorcyclists were ripping the zombies apart. I have seen this done in many more effective ways. So if your planning on seeing this movie, don't, and if you already have then your probably suffering the same pain Iam from watching that long torturous film. Pure dreck."
"The helicopter pilot traffic reporter Stephen (David Emge) and his pregnant lover Francine (Gaylen Ross) decide to steal the radio aircraft and fly to Canada, looking for a safer life without the epidemic of zombies. Their friend Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) and Peter (Ken Foree), two Philadelphia SWAT team members, go with them. Due to the short autonomy of the small helicopter for such a long flight, they seek refugee in an abandoned mall. They clean the place, sealing the entrances and killing the zombies in its interior, and live a quite reasonable life for months, when another external menace threatens the group of survivors. The original 'Dawn of the Dead' is an insuperable classic. Yesterday I watched it again, maybe for the fourth or fifth time, to compare with the recently released remake, and although being a 1978 movie, the special effects are spectacular and the story is amazingly original. The second part of George Romero's trilogy is an excellent horror movie, highly recommended to any fan of this genre. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Zombie  Despertar dos Mortos' ('Zombie  Awakening of the Dead')"
"As the dead continue to rise up and live again as flesh hungry zombies, civilisation begins to crumble as the problem becomes too big to be easily defeated.  In Philadelphia a traffic reporter and his girlfriend use the helicopter to take refuge in a mall where they are joined by a couple of SWAT officers.  Their first mission is to seal the mall and clear it of the undead.  However as they fortify the army of the undead only continues to grow.Having recently made the rather scary and fast paced remake, I thought I would revisit the original just to see it again.  The main thing I prefer about the original is how the gore is served up with a satirical edge that the remake pretty much didn't even bother with.  Here, much like Shaun of the Dead, the zombies are just trying to do what they did in life - walk aimlessly around a massive mall, not entirely sure what they're after but doing it none the less.  This makes that point reasonably well but I actually preferred it in Shaun (but I know it could be because this is an older film).The horror of this film comes from the gore as the zombies are far too slow and easily avoided to be really truly scary.  Again this may be down to the film's age as jaded audiences will scare a whole lot harder than they did back then simply due to the excesses that have been piled upon us.  The gore is still quite hard for me to watch though and there were quite a few moments when I watched through my fingers.  The idea is still good and the number of zombies involved (as well as some other aspects) covers from plot problems that arose in the remake.The cast are all pretty good and it isn't as predictable who will make it and who won't as it is in some other slasher movies where you can spot the fodder miles away.  The problem with this film to me is that it has dated badly, the story has been opened out from the Night and has lost tension and atmosphere as a result - with only the bloody red gore to replace it.  The scares have been lost with familiarity and the film's comedy just doesn't really work in the context.  It's a shame, because I usually don't like remakes but I do have to say that the remake is a lot scarier and Shaun of the Dead is a lot funnier and makes the same sort of comments on society.Overall this is still a good movie that uses the horror genre to make comments about a commercialist society that is (literally) eating itself with the pursuit of stuff for stuff's sake.  Age has not treated it well but it is still worth seeing."
If this review is lacking then apologies but I find it a difficult film to review mainly down to the fact I`ve seen it umpteen times since the early 1980s . Unfortunately I first saw it on video which meant DAWN OF THE DEAD gets lumped into the rest of the video nasties that came out at the same time . In fact all my peers believed it to be a sequel to ZOMBI FLESH EATERS when it`s a sequel to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD . Incidentally most of those same peers liked ZOMBI FLESH EATERS but postively hated NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEADIt`s certainly flawed as is everything Romero has done . The acting is amatuerish and it`s no surprise that the cast didn`t go onto bigger things . The technical aspects suffer badly from the lack of budget like the sound where it`s sometimes difficult to hear the dialogue while the editing is all over the place in some scenes and as for the make up it`s sometimes laughable or sometimes non existant . All this is a great pity since there is a truly great story in here somewhere . If truth be told DAWN suffers from the fact that like 28 DAYS LATER the zombi element overwhelms the main story which is trying to be a gritty and realistic survivalist drama along the same lines as Romero`s earlier bleak and depressing THE CRAZIES . Despite the flaws this an intelligent film which concentrates on human interaction and relationshipsBy the way the BBC showed the director`s cut last night and I can see what the problem was with it . I really enjoyed the exploding head but there`s far too many scenes where the camera lovingly lingers on the gore . The gore isn`t distressing in anyway but as I said it`s unintenionally laughable as zombies tear open stomachs and stuff that looks like cooked macaroni pops out of victims bodies
"There's no much to say about this movie that wasn't said before. This is one of the hilarious, horrifying and goriest movies of all time. George A. Romero brought us a masterpiece of black humor and violence, also with a very interesting and relevant critic content. Dawn of the Dead isn't just a horror movie. Dawn... is an acid, pungent and veracious social critic about alienation, consumerism and lacks of communication. OK, there are some continuity errors and also the acting is not so good, but that's doesn't bother so much when you have such a genius screenplay and a brilliant direction like in Dawn of the Dead. A horror movie that have so much to say. Groundbreaking and unique!"
"Some people believe that ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the greatest zombie film ever made. I respectfully disagree. While it is certainly ""one of the best"", I am a firm believer that its predecessor, ""Night of the Living Dead"", deserves that honor. Be that as it may, this movie essentially takes up where ""Night of the Living Dead"" left off. The zombies have multiplied to an extent that society has broken down and chaos has emerged. In this environment, four humans (3 men and 1 woman) have escaped by helicopter to an abandoned shopping mall. Realizing that this is a good place to hide out, they decide to make it their temporary home. It has food, liquor, guns and ammunition. It even has an arcade for entertainment. Their main task then, is to secure the mall to keep the zombies out. Once this is accomplished though, the zombies on the outside continue to want to get in. And they never quit trying. Unfortunately, the zombies aren't the only ones who want to get in. At any rate, rather than give away the entire storyline I'll just say that this film has plenty of blood and guts for the hard-core fans of this genre. It also has some humorous scenes interspersed throughout as well. And while some of the humor is a bit over-the-top, it just seems to fit in for some reason. The acting is decent and the director (George A. Romero) is probably the world's greatest expert when it come to this kind of film. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think that most zombie fans would probably say the same thing."
"With a unique perspective George A. Romero gives a story that deep you could see it in a billion different ways. As a Drama, or an Adventure where our protagonists trying to be Kings of the Mall, perhaps a Horror epic where humans brink of destruction clearly takes away our humanity that lowers us even below the Zombies. The undead are used as a tool to bring up what Romero wants to say. Only that is creative beyond all brilliance. Humans battles and arguments for fighting goes on while these creatures tries to be a part of the rich hierarchy. Sometimes we could bring some of the issues home to our reality and the underlying fears are powerful. The fact that this movie is very easy to ovaranalyze just makes it more interesting. The characters are mostly very memorable and all the wishes for them to survive trough the ordeal are there. The movies tone is also special and sarcastic but dealth with such a masterfully hand that knows what its doing. The line ""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth"" was that great that it also was used to represent the Movies Tagline. Which is a wonderful touch i never seen before. Not a perfect movie, since i don't believe in them."
"""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"".Romero completes the 2nd entry in his series of living dead movies. Four friends (Two PA. SWAT team members, a pilot, and a television studio coordinator) hijack a TV studio's helicopter in their effort to escape Philadelphia, which is being over-ran by zombies.

"Dawn of the Dead is positively one of the worst films ever made.  Yes, it is.  It's worse than Manos the Hands of Fate, worse than Severed Ties, worse than Battlefield Earth, worse than Igor and the Lunatics... worse than just about any movie you could name.  It redefined my conception of how bad a movie could actually be.There's nothing here.  There's no horror, no poignant social satire, no scathing attack on American consumer culture.  How can these characters be making some kind of a statement about American society when they're so stupid they don't even know what a shopping mall is?  Look at them--they're dumb enough to steal money from a bank even though society has completely fallen apart and they can get anything they need from the mall anyway!  And what kind of social commentary can you attach to that awful scene where the biker gang throws pies into the zombies' faces?  Or the utterly useless racketball scene?  Or the completely inappropriate Pac-Man musical score? Dawn of the Dead is NOT a socially relevant film.  It's just two very long hours of garbage--ugly, poorly acted, ludicrous garbage. 
I've tried to like this movie, I really have.  But there's nothing worthwhile in it.  It's not scary, it's not entertaining, and it's not meaningful.  It's just a sad, painfully misguided waste of time.  Heaven save us from George Romero and his alien brainwashing ray."
"...and one of my all-time favorite movies, George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" reset the standards for cinematic horror as the 70s drew to a close. Its inspired combination of bleak realism, social commentary, gallows humor, and cartoonish-yet-viscerally-effective Grand Guignol special effects paved the way for all that was yet to come. The only horror movies of the period with remotely comparable influence (imnsho) would be John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" both of which already owed immense debts to Romero's seminal lo-fi classic ""Night of the Living Dead"".I feel sorrow for today's young, ADHD-impaired, insufferably jaded audience, many of whom are seemingly unable to invest themselves in a film. I have no doubt that most of the negative comments on this site are from viewers who've never seen ""Dawn of the Dead"" on the big screen and haven't got the ability to imagine the experience. Some blame must be placed on the advent of home video, which has removed the cinematic experience from the theater and placed it in the uncloistered and distraction-laden venue of the home, but mostly I attribute it to unrealistic expectations and a general atrophying of the imagination, attributable somewhat to the tidal wave of in-your-face gore that ""Dawn of the Dead"" helped unleash, but more so to quantum leaps in sfx technology that have seduced filmmakers away from the suggestive to the overt. All I can really tell you is that back in the spring of 1979, after first viewing of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I had zombie nightmares for weeks. No lie, and I enjoyed every one of them. Quite literally, there had been nothing like it before, not in its disturbing, benighted totality. Herschell Gordon Lewis may have first tapped the vein of overt grue in schlock classics like ""Two Thousand Maniacs!"" and ""Blood Feast"", certainly, while auteurs like Hooper, Carpenter, Wes ""Last House on the Left"" Craven, and Romero himself explored the possibilities of effective indie low-budget frights, but Hollywood had pretty much steered clear of such nasty business, notwithstanding its growing love affair with squibs for bullet wounds (cf. ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""The Wild Bunch,"" and ""Soldier Blue,"" etal.) and its undeniable need to sublimate the rising tide of violence in post-Vietnam, post-civil uprising, post-Watergate America. I'm sorry, but today's spoiled, couch potato audiences have nothing but my sympathies and condolences for their impaired appreciation of cornerstone genre cinema.Any horror fan worthy of the appellation already intimately knows the plot and characters of ""Dawn of the Dead"" inside out, and I won't subject whatever zombie virgins might be reading this to yet another summary of the story. If you're one of them, you can go read someone else's comments. Suffice to say that Romero adapts the only truly effective zombie movie scenario---living survivors attempting to weather out a plague of the implacable, ravenous living dead---to his anti-consumerist theme to once again effectively expound upon human fallibility within when faced with inexorable pressures without.""Dawn of the Dead"" is not without its faults, of course, despite my highly subjective rating of ""10"" here on the IMDb. Only a fool would deny them. The make-up and sfx by Tom ""you have to ask?"" Savini and crew, a benchmark in its day, are certainly dated, though they still play well with Romero's satirical intent, and serve to somewhat soften the sheer repulsiveness of the gruesome violence they depict, a quality that soon disappeared in later Savini projects like ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Maniac,"" and ""The Prowler."" The acting, though nowhere near as bad as some wet-behind-the-ears curmudgeons on this site would have you believe, is occasionally zombie stiff but more than serviceable; Ken ""The Devil's Rejects"" Foree unquestionably has the best acting chops of Romero's quartet of anti-heroes, and has enjoyed a successful B-movie career, but I remain quite fond of the other three as well. Michael ""Day of the Dead"" Gornick's cinematography is unflashy but effective, thanks to Romero's able editing and a screenplay that drops the viewer right smack in the middle of apocalyptic mayhem and confusion.Mostly ignored on this site is the fact that ""Dawn of the Dead"" was one of the first films (if not THE first) to demonstrate that success could be had outside the purview of mainstream distribution channels despite the onus of refusing to submit to the demands of a currently decade-old MPAA. Released unrated (with an advisory that no one under 17 would be admitted due to the violent content), ""Dawn of the Dead"" recouped its production costs on opening weekend and went on to make tens of millions of dollars, for which any horror buff ought to be immensely grateful. In a way, it was the ""Star Wars"" of indie horror movies.I don't expect these comments of mine to change anyone's opinion of the film. Part of the beauty of the filmgoing experience is that it is so highly subjective; one man's meat is another man's poison. So be it. As my judo sensei once told me long ago, some people have eyes but do not see. If just one person who's never seen Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is motivated to give it a shot because of these comments, I'll count the time and effort composing them well worth the bother. After all, when there's no more room in Hell, the braindead will worship remakes and belittle the originals that made them possible in the first place, and there's just something wrong with that."
"No matter what everyone out there says, this flick is ""THE"" zombie movie of all time, period. Pappa Romero is at his peak as a writer/director, delivering engaging character development (withdelighted nods to underrated Ken Foree, simply chewing the scenery as the true hero of the proceedings), gruesome and splattering violence(some shots are really disgusting), hard-hitting criticism at the society (which are unfortunately still valid) and, to end the whole thing, a touching love story!!!! Damn, is this fella good or what? The quite long running time and slow pace can be harmful to most viewers,specially those not accustomed to use their brains while watching a movie. The plot unfolds step by step, with more than occasional scenes of the main characters doing jack-nothing, like gathering food or testing clothes. But it has a purpose, I assure you guys. Because all of it is important to hint what is between the lines. The social commentary beneath the exploding heads and guts pushes the experience to another level. Some shots of the mall are really disturbing in their simplicity, creating an uneasy and insanity-inducing atmosphere throughout the whole thing. The special effects and make-up are creative and effective, aiding the tension and fear into an almost unbearable high. The relentlessness of the monsters (both human and zombies) is bone-wrecking, with many cool and violent action sequences to balance it all. Violent, smart, tense and then some! ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a must-see for all film fans, even those who can't stand the genre; it excels in expert film-making and intelligence."
"Sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"". In this one it seems the dead are taking over the country. Four people (three men, one woman) escape to a shopping mall and try to fight off the living dead and figure out what to do.It starts off great with a confusing and VERY gory sequence and then sort of slows down when they get to the mall. There are still the occasional bouts of gore but it quickly turns into a satire on consumerism! There's nothing wrong with that but it makes that point...and keeps rubbing it in the audiences face. It slowly starts to get dull...until a gory rampage kicks in to end the movie.In 1978 this was considered a strong movie in terms of gore and satire. The gore still works (there's a lot and it's graphic) but the satire seems very dated now. Still this is a classic--in its way. It was released unrated but no one under 17 was allowed in the theatre. Despite that it was a big hit and a rare horror film that critics actually liked. I remember finding this great back in 1979--but it seems kind of weak and dated over 20 years later. However the gore still holds up and it does have a few moments guaranteed to make you jump. Great music score too. I do agree it's a classic but I can truthfully only give the movie a 7. The satire really weighs this down."
"Terrible cinematography.  Terrible lighting.  Terrible script.  Terrible acting.  Terrible score.  Terrible . . . aw, it's not worth the time to go on.Though be forewarned: don't let the high rating and favorable comments fool you.  Most of the people voting are cult fans of the movie and are rating it high for that reason alone.If a wider audience viewed this movie, then voted, it would have a rating of 1.0 at best.Let me tell you, it took the Exorcist - a true horror masterpiece - to cleanse me of this garbage called Dawn of the Dead.I suggest watching just about any other horror movie than this."
"The zombies from ""Night of the Living Dead"" have continued their rampage... and our heroes are forced to hole up in a shopping mall. Now they have everything they could ever want, except for the continuous onslaught of the undead.The commentary track is with George Romero, wife Christine Forrest Romero, effects maestro Tom Savini and Anchor Bay DVD guy Perry Martin, who knows this film inside and out... recorded in George's living roomDario Argento's role in this film should not be downplayed, as allegedly the sequel was proposed by Dario Argento, not Romero (though Romero discovered the mall and its crawlspaces prior to Argento's suggestion). Argento's cut of the film was for European markets, with the humor removed to make it more Fulci-like. Luckily, we rarely see that one. The film stars Ken Foree, who went on to do more great things, but Romero alumnus John Amplas shows up (as well as his job as casting director and makeup assistant), and the DP is Michael Gornick, who went on to do directing of his own.Tom Savini tells us that a ""drunken zombie stole a golf cart, drove it around the mall and crashed into a pillar"". Savini makes a great biker, except when he goes through the break-away glass -- the stunt crew poured the glass too thick and he injured his knee. Tom says his work on this film got him ""Friday the 13th"", and one can only wonder how horror would have gone different if he had not been on that film.You really should see this one if you have not, and while watching it, drink some Iron City Beer."
"Dawn of the Dead is truly the masterpiece of Zombie movies, putting George A. Romero at his pinnacle. It follows the same premise of Romero's original work, Night of the Living Dead. The recently dead are coming back to life and feeding off the flesh of the living, turning our familiar world upside-down. Two t.v. reporters and two S.W.A.T. team members go on the run and hold-up in a huge mall. Ironically, the place of dreams becomes their own cell. Trapped in materialism, their sense of survival dulls. Unlike its predecessor, Dawn of the Dead gives us a little more depth, better acting, and a better script. A little camp must remain, along with more humor, such as special effect guru Tom Savini also doing some acting and a stunt. Ultimately, this gives Dawn of the Dead a less cynical ending than Night of the Living Dead. Dawn of the Dead is simply one of the best horror movies ever. It is one of a very few ""thinking"" man's horror film. The zombies, themselves, are caricatures of modern-day America, trapped in consumerism and desire for food. In the end, who really becomes the walking dead?"
"Dawn of the Dead is a bona fide, cast iron classic. Forget the remakes and the cash ins (good to see someone has stumped up the cash for Romero to make Land of the Dead rather than pay-rolling every Hollywood hack, McG wannabe to rip off the master) - this is the original and the best. From the beginning, starting off in a TV station in a state of chaos, the film never lets up. It skilfully expands upon the situation that first emerged in Night of the Living Dead, cranking it up to the max. Zombies are running amok, killing and eating the living. The killed stand right back up and become zombies. The odds are already stacked against humanity and the film acknowledges this by taking the brilliant decision to follow a group of survivors trying to flee the situation. This isn't a film about coming up with the big solution to the problem, this is a film about trying to stay alive. A masterful social satire, black comedy and balls out horror film Dawn of the Dead has it all. What's truly great about this film is the way it isn't afraid to suddenly shift gears and change tone. We're fleeing with our heroes in a helicopter. Hey, lets suddenly drop in on a bunch of rednecks having a great old time using the zombies for target practise. That was fun wasn't it. Oh wait, here come some terrifying zombie kids. Scared again? Romero keeps bouncing us around, perfectly in control of his material and yet happy to let it break loose once in a while. Spontanteous custard pie fight in the middle of a pitched battle between zombies and bikers? Yeah, go on then. Dawn of the Dead doesn't skimp on the gore but it's also got the smarts to back it up. Like the other entries in the Dead trilogy (and hopefully in Land too) there is a rich vein of satirical social commentary running through the film. See those zombies wandering aimlessly around the mall? They're us they are. Whilst I love and admire the truly nihilistic ending to Night of the Living Dead (surely the bleakest ending to a film since Clouzot's Wages of Fear) Romero does right by his heroes and gives them an escape, a chance to run and try and stay alive some more. Why do I keep calling them heroes? They're flawed, selfish, stupid, honourable and brave. Guess they're us too. When there's no more room in Hell the dead will walk the Earth (undoubtedly THE greatest tag line in the history of film). It seems now that when there's no more room in development Hell brainless Hollywood execs will remake every film ever made. Give them a miss and check out the original. It will haunt you forever."
"i couldn't bear watch the whole film. it was really stupid. annoying music, incredibly bad acting and zombies who would make you laugh to death before they ever reach you. this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. i would not recommend this to anyone.... a total disaster..."
"well, this movie started out with lots of people running around, shooting zombies... and it ended that way... with just shooting in between. basically: watch the film for five minutes, and you have the whole plot set out. watch the last five, and you see the ending. if you want to stick around for about another hour watching whats in between - bad make up, blood that looks like paint, and generally annoying actors who repeat the same stuff over, and over, and over again, then enjoy; but in my opinion, every copy of this movie should be burned and its memory swiped from mankind to make the world; a better place. oh and for those people who like this 90 minute spectacular, get a life, and start watching better movies."
"This movie is lame! Does anyone really find people painted blue and moaning constantly scary? A quote from a critic on the back of the video box went as follows ""one of the best horror films ever made"". Upon reading this I was foolishly suckered in and rented it out looking forward to having the living daylights scared out of me! Instead, I had a laughing attack not afforded to me since childhood! It really berates the horror genre when this movie is considered a classic. Its boredom all the way as people that look as though they've been face painted at the local church fete pass themselves off as zombies. A man on crutches heavily sedated could outrun these flesh-eating fiends. So to summarise, the make-up is poor, the script works well as a comedy and the film is as about as scary as a rice pudding without jam!"
"Dawn of the Dead is my favourite of the ""dead"" series next to the original Night of the Living Dead. It begins pretty much right after ""Night"" ended. A couple named Francine and Stephen along with Peter and Roger take a helicopter and head out to find some sort of help or a safe place to stay for a while. They end up stopping on the roof of a large shopping mall and decide it's the perfect place to stay. It has all of the necessary resources they'd need including food and ammo. The only obstacles in their way are the hungry zombies and a biker gang hellbent on looting the mall.The main filming location of the shopping centre was a brilliant idea. It's a lot of fun watching the characters roam around the mall picking up whatever they want or need all the while battling zombies who are hungry for human flesh. The gore is at an extreme in 'Dawn' thanks to Tom Savini. We get blood and organs and everything imaginable being eaten, really brutal stuff. The zombie makeup wasn't that good, they looked purple and gray and very ordinary but no big deal. I also really liked the character development in this film. You feel for them and want them to survive the attack.I love this original Dawn of the Dead, it is better than the remake which I've seen. The moments in the shopping mall are classic, and with such a low budget you have to commend Romero and the entire crew for putting together such a masterpiece.8/10"
"I was a little bored of this film, but as it went on, I grew to like and respect it for what it was and when it was made.So, the plot is set up a few months after ""Night."" A group of survivors of this plague that turns the dead into zombies take shelter in a shopping mall. Put two and two together now.First off, I want to say of how smart it is to camp out at a mall if we ever end up in a plague like this (I don't think we will, but who knows). You've got everything in here; clothes, food, accessories. You could basically live inside of a mall, and I guess that is what this film establishes: how we, as a society, love to go to the mall because that's where they have the stuff. I mean, even the zombies here go to the mall because that's where their instinct tells them to go. It's perfect. Bravo, Mr. Romero.My one complaint is just a minor one: I heard about this scene in which a zombie gets his head chopped off by a helicopter. Well, the version that I saw didn't have that, and I was really looking forward to seeing that. When I didn't see it, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I wasn't looking when it happened, but I don't know.Other than that, this is a really good film that has left its mark on horror genre. I truly recommend it if you are a true horror fan. I know that this got the remake treatment, although this time, I heard that people were pleased with the remake. I have nothing against that, but I still believe that people would rather see this film over the remake. A 9/10 for me."
"Great zombie effects and an excellent setting, make this a must see movie for any zombie fan. As for everyone else, you'll either love it or hate it, but I recommend you experience it at least once. Zombies are taking over the world and humans are becoming an endangered species. Two s.w.a.t. team members and a couple of TV station employees, hold up in a shopping mall, while the undead gather outside and lets just say things go a little awry.Executed brilliantly by Romero and helped along by Tom Savini's cool make-up effects. You can tell that the director is passionate about his work and enjoys commenting on political and social matters in his own unique way. A message to all newcomers to this genre, don't forget to check out it's remake and companions in the series. The're all just as good, and are essential viewing for any zombie fan."
"One of the most important components in a horror film is its premise... Do you buy off on it? Is it possible in some weird way? Could it happen here and now? If the answers are yes, the film is that much more effective in pulling you in...You become involved in a visceral way... This film does just that. Dawn of the Dead throws you on a roller coaster ride, that despite its over-the-top violence and gore, you have a ball with (even if you are a little nauseous at the end)!MINOR SPOILERS> Dawn of the Dead doesn't waste time... It cuts right to the chase in an urgent, chaotic manner that grabs you and never lets go... Through the haze, we start to grasp who our main characters are going to be...It doesn't matter much if we like or care about them - They don't even know that much about each other. We all end up going along for the ride in a desperate escape attempt that through the course of the film, almost succeeds. There are so many memorable shots in this film; The SWAT caper at the start, the Zombie who gets his head lopped off by the chopper, the Zombies at the mall when everything is powered up, the ""shopping"" sprees with all the freeze shots of the mannequins watching our heroes, countless battles with the Zombies, the ultimate confrontation with the biker gang, and many others in-between. Through everything, we grow fond of our characters and root for them. We forgive their irritating idiosyncrasies and sympathize with their plight. We feel like we're in battle with them. We hate losing them and want them all to survive. This is one ""Monster Movie"" that through great shooting (no pun intended), overcomes the goofy makeup and gore effects which permeate the film. Rather, these effects become humorous and campy at certain points and shocking and horrific at others. The no-name cast is effective and their low-key approach (based on their circumstances, I thought it was pretty low-key!) to their situation was the way to play it. Ken Foree is right-on as the self-appointed leader. Scott Reiniger is great as his young buck sidekick. Scott is the most likable off the gang, and the chances he takes battling the monsters have us biting our nails. David Emge and Gaylen Ross play the TV News couple that hook up the chopper and get things rolling. While at times Stephen irritated the heck out of me, I figured if I was in his shoes I'd probably be worse. Francine was good as the 70's Ice Princess who hangs tough despite being pregnant. There are many messages in this film. The first time I saw it (I was 17), I could only think how cool it was and what a fantastic time I had seeing it with several of my best friends...Watching it again and again through the years, I began to notice the great camera work in spite of the low budget, the GREAT work of all the Zombie extras, and I think, the ultimate message (also in its great predecessor, NIGHT of the Living Dead) that humanity is on a course for disaster that we may not be able to control. God help us and boy, I love this movie!!!!!"
"OOOOOoooooohhhh, what a great zombie movie! This is really the real stuff, zombie walking into the rotor blade of a helicopter! Where else can you perceive such a delicate manoeuvre performed by a Nobel prize candidate master mind zombie? See this movie, for your own sake, it's definitely worth the time."
"After the cult success enjoyed by Night of the Living Dead, and the box office failures of his next few films, one might think that George Romero would return to the Living Dead for a quick buck. If you thought that, I would encourage you to reconsider. Dawn of the Dead is, in some ways, superior to his 1968 classic. First of all, the production values were much higher, allowing Romero to accomplish more in terms of sets and talent. Tom Savini was back from Vietnam, so he was available to gross out the world with his fabulous effects. But this film goes way beyond gore; there is a strong social commentary that exists throughout this film. Romero's message is that of commercialism, and how much it seems to mean to Americans. It is no mistake that most of the film takes place in a shopping mall. When I walk through my local mall, it always brings me back to visions of this movie, and all the mindless zombies who just can't wait to get inside the stores. Before I ramble too long, I would just like to thank George Romero & Co. for a really great film."
"George A. Romero gave us a great film when he made Night of the living dead but in this sequel he gave us the greatest horror film of all time. The gore and effects by Tom Savini were amazing considering it was a late 70's film.The movie's four protagonists segregate themselves from the world hiding in a shopping mall. Making the place into a sort of home where they have everything they will ever need. Until they are found by demented bikers who ruin their plans of living in the mall. The gore at this point is lots of and plenty of. The heads are rolling and the blood is pouring in this horror masterpiece. Starring Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross, David Emge and Scott H. Reinger.When There's no more room in hell the dead will walk the Earth"
"Dawn of the Dead is a fascinating movie.  On the surface, it's a typical zombie movie, but as usual, George Romero is really saying so much more.  This movie isn't about zombies.  It's about people.  It asks the question of who the real monsters are.  The mall setting in this movie is great.  The zombies are shown as a reflection of American society, the way we are so drowned in consumerism.  At one point in the movie, Fran says, ""You're all hypnotized by this place.  It's so wrapped up in a neat little package you don't realize it's a prison too."" And throughout the movie we see the survivors slowly become what they despise as they become wrapped up in the materialism that the shopping mall offers. This is such a great movie, and it's much better if you watch it not just as a gory horror movie, which some people make the mistake of doing.  It's so much more than that."
"I'd heard a lot about how this movie was a horror classic, so I went ahead and bought it when I saw it on sale cheap. All I can say is ""Huh?"" On the upside, there is indeed some social commentary, broaching topics such as racism, consumerism and the fact that the bikers in the end seem a lot more evil than the zombies. But that's all there is in this movie, and the rest of it, quite frankly, is awful.1) The movie is not at all scary. The zombies look idiotic; I don't mind low budget but smearing grayish paste all over someone's face (they didn't even bother with the rest of their body) is the kind of makeup job I expect in a high school play. The zombies never seem at all threatening, as they move at the speed of a snail and are totally uncoordinated. The only way I can see them killing ANYONE is if you're an idiot who runs into a dead-end room and just stands there waiting for a whole horde to come to you.2) The movie fails to deliver ANY kind of atmosphere. Aside from a few bare bones newscasts on the fate of various parts of the US, most of the movie takes place in a brightly lit mall, where the characters don't feel at all in danger and a 'the world is ending' feel is totally nonexistent. There's no appreciable action element either; I think pro wrestling looks more realistic than this. And why the hell do the characters keep wasting their time shooting zombies in the chest when it's been clearly established that only head shots kill them? 3) The acting is very, very bad. The dialogue is hackneyed and weak, and the character development is forced and mostly just made me roll my eyes a lot, thinking ""They expect me to buy THIS?"" The social commentary in this movie could be made with a half-hour documentary, or better yet, a 6-page paper for a high school sociology class, and I would have been saved $10 and 2 hours of my time. I will not forgive it."
"This is not a review. This is a warning. Before I start to slay, three things I have to say:1) Dawn of the Dead is a B-movie. Weapon grade BALONEY. 2) George A. Romero is a very, VERY BAD director. 3) Tom Savini is a cool dude.Dawn of the Dead (DOTD) is not a horror movie, it's not a comedy, well, in fact it's a big NOTHING! Why? I tell you why!CONCEPT/BASIC IDEA: The basic idea of this trash is quite good. A couple of people hide in a shopping mall to stay away from flesh eating zombies. The set-up is promising but the delivery is ridiculous. A good idea was wasted in the hands of a director who has no clue of what is good and what is bad. SCRIPT: Romeros 5 year old niece, who obviously wrote the script, is not very talented and a bit inexperienced. Romeros contribution made everything even worse. Dario Argento didn't read the script, he just pretended that he did. When it came to the Euro Cut, it was too late to make changes.ACTING: Half way into the movie I thought that I saw a zombie holding cue cards for the ""actors"". Think of Steven Segal or Jean Claude VanDamme trying to deliver a credible performance. It is not possible, because there is no acting talent. My theory is that between two takes the zombies ate certain parts of the actors brains which are needed to give a convincing performance. Romero should have noticed this but maybe he was too busy coloring some sexy blonde zombie boobs with red paint.MAKE UP/EFFECTS: Well made gore, guts and cut off limbs are crucial to a zombie movie. What do you do when you realize that you are short on money and everything looks like garbage? You make a satirical comedy that tries to reflect society with a biting edge! What do you do if you are George A. Romero? You produce an unfunny mush-mash without focus and fail miserably!MUSIC: Scary, suspenseful music is neglect-able, after all it is a comedy! Goblin used all the good ideas for Suspiria. You don't try too hard when you get paid 2 Dollars for a movie score. Romero realized that after he finished coloring the boobs and bought the cheapest synthesizer of 1978 to create some ambiance.THE ENDING (Spoilers): Big black man tells dumb blonde girl that he doesn't want to escape with her. He does not want to live so he prepares to commit suicide with the smallest gun in the entire movie (a model that evil ladies used to hide in their stockings). When the zombies finally arrive and attack him he suddenly changes his mind, climbs onto the roof, combats a couple of zombies like Bruce Lee on a bad day, and gets into the helicopter to fly away. That's it. That's the climatic ending.Seriously, I think that DOTD has become a ""classic"" because a lot of American people are in love with guns and shooting. The body-count is really high so this may satisfy some urges. If you want good horror that leaves you disturbed and speechless, look elsewhere. Luckily a friend of mine borrowed me this movie, so I didn't feel bad when I finished it. I was glad that I haven't bought it.The real brain-dead zombies are the people who give this film a high rating and call it ""one of the best horror movies ever made""."
"...for saying this, but this movie truly isn't good. Not at all. The zombies are un-frightening(what with them having only white makeup to show that they are undead), the concept is rather silly(world being taken over by slow-moving, killable, stupid zombies) and the soundtrack is not related to the events in the movie in any way. The actors tend to do really strange thing, like staring blankly into space when they know they're in a zombie-infected area or leaving the girl unprotected and un-armed. If you like to be scared, don't expect anything from this movie. It doesn't even try. That said, I've better build a hideout from the angry Romero fans."
"Dawn of the Dead (1978) **** (out of 4) Sequel to Night of the Living Dead has four people holding up in a mall where they try to figure out what to do next due to the zombie outbreak, which is taking over the country. It's not often a sequel to one of the greatest horror films ever made manages to be even better but that's what Romero pulled off in this masterpiece, which isn't just one of the greatest horror films but it takes its place as one of the greatest films period. The movie works on so many levels because it's disgusting, vile, violent, sadistic, depressing, funny, smart and technically brilliant. The movie not only works as a blood and guts horror film but it also works perfectly as a drama because Romero's screenplay gives us plenty of time to get to know the four characters and feel for them. That's something brave to do with a horror film and in its theatrical cut, running an epic-feeling 127-minutes, we get a lot of character development and there's even a large stretch where we forget the zombies because we're so wrapped up in the character stuff. I think the screenplay contains the perfect mixture of drama and horror but it also manages to throw in some social comments as well as some great humor. The screenplay never really gets the credit it deserves, which might seem like a strange thing to say considering it's one of the most respected horror films by critics and fans. I thought it was a masterful job to set the action inside a mall, a place where the characters can get everything they need to live a perfect life yet there is that small problem of the zombies. The performances are another major plus even though these too get some bashing by some. Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, Gaylen Ross and David Emge don't deliver Oscar-caliber performances but they do suit the characters just fine and really bring them to life, which is a rather hard thing to do. Being able to bring the characters to life isn't possible if the performances are bad. We also have the masterful special effects by Tom Savini, which are still breathtaking all these years later. There are countless classic gore shots including the head being blown off at the start of the film, the blood pressure death and the unforgettable gut pulling sequence. The zombie creations are all simple but very good. I stop short of calling this the greatest horror film ever made but it's certainly in my top three. The movie works on so many levels that you can't help but get caught up in all the drama each time you view the film, which isn't something that can be said about too many films within the genre."
"When George A. Romero first shocked moviegoers back in 1968, it was with ""Night of the Living Dead"", a dark, brutal zombie film saturated with atmospheric black and white cinematography and unflinching gore, which was quite unheard of at the time.So audiences may have been somewhat surprised when they saw Romero's follow-up, ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978. The suspense factor has been turned down considerably, the eerie atmosphere (largely due to the gorgeous B&W cinematography) is all but gone, and the cynical commentary on human nature has been replaced with a rather different, though still somewhat cynical explication of mankind, which I'll get to later.First, the story. ""Dawn"" supposedly takes place right after the events of ""Night"", even though Romero has made no effort to hide the progression of fashion from the '60s to the '70s. The film centers around four people: Francine (Ross), a headstrong woman trying to prove her worth; Stephen (Emge), a helicopter pilot and also Francine's boyfriend; Peter (Foree), a laid-back SWAT team member; and Roger (Reiniger), a rowdy and at times juvenile SWAT team member. After Francine and Stephen escape a chaotic TV studio and Peter and Roger survive a brutal raid, the four of them take to the sky in a chopper to find some kind of refuge from the ever-growing zombie epidemic that is engulfing the planet. What they find is a sprawling shopping mall that has been abandoned by everyone except a substantial amount of undead denizens. They land, grab some supplies, and, eventually, make the mall their home.As I said earlier, ""Night"" featured some very cynical social commentary on human nature, but Romero has moved on to what's bugging him now: modern consumerism. The zombies in the mall are meant to represent the raving masses as they flock to shopping centers to buy things they don't need. This is made rather obvious at many points in the film, especially during this exchange: -Francine: ""What are they (the zombies) doing? Why do they come here (the mall)?"" -Stephen: ""Some kind of instinct, memory of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives."" Is there even any doubt as to what Romero was trying to say?But don't worry, horror fans, for while Romero was layering in all his clever little metaphors and commentaries, he didn't forget the one important little element that makes ""Dawn of the Dead"" so infamous: gore. ""Night"" was nothing compared to this. We're talking graphic, unrelenting, envelope-destroying zombie carnage, complete with beheadings, disembowlings, and more than enough head-shots to go around, including one particularly memorable scene where a zombie loses his entire head due to a shotgun blast. While the blood itself looks extremely fake, Tom Savini's groundbreaking make-up effects more than make up for it. In fact, the candy-colored blood actually adds a certain indefinable something to the film, as it tends to focus more on macabre humor than actual horror and suspense.The acting is cheesy and rather poor, but this IS a 1970s zombie film. The dialogue is at times decent and at times laughable (in a good way, sort of). The Goblin's score is, like the acting and dialogue, cheesy, but still manages to create a certain appeal. It grows on you, trust me. The direction is quite good most of the time and maintains a very cohesive visual feel throughout the 127 minute running time (or 139 if you're watching the extended version, or 119 if you're watching Dario Argento's cut). But the flaws I mentioned are minor and can most certainly be overlooked due to the film's good qualities, which are staggeringly high.The recent surge of zombie films has yielded some good (28 Days Later) and some bad (Dawn of the Dead (2004)) results, but no modern film full of sprinting undead will ever surpass ""Dawn of the Dead"", a true classic and the quintessential zombie film that will reign supreme for years upon years to come.9/10"
"I'm a horror fan. I've watched and enjoyed every horror movie I can get my hands on, from Halloween to Jeepers Creepers. And I'm always looking for the classics. I've seen the oldies (Universal movies), Hitchcock films and everything since. Halloween is a great movie with a unique use of the camera to create suspense. Friday the 13th is a good follow up to the genre with a nice twist at the end. Nightmare on Elm Street has the greatest villain ever created with a completely new notion (you die in your dreams). Hellraiser takes you to an incredible crazy world of gore. The Shinning is touched with the genius of Kubrick. And I could go on and on, quoting classics and discussing the reasons why they became cult movies for hours.But this? What the hell is this? How can this underdog movie become a classic? How can someone like this stuff? Terrible acting, even worse effects (if you don't have the money to do it right, DON'T DO IT!), the story has more holes than swiss cheese and the ending is just ridiculous! The more I think about it the more I hate it. I never understood the ""so bad it's good"" concept. This is so bad it's bad! The humour in the film is not intended, it's there because Romero made a laughable attempt at a scary flick. He is the Ed Wood of the seventies. If you want to laugh a bit then watch a TROMA movie!"
"I never really saw the original Dawn of the Dead until now. Saw the remake but the original is better than that remake of Dawn of the Dead. It starts off at a TV station showing how the zombies are slowly attacking. Also The Goblins, the band used for the Dawn of the Dead, I first heard they're music from Hell of the Living Dead when the Cinema Snob reviewed it. Dawn of the Dead also looks good in color especially in High Definition. Then at the TV studio a girl and a guy try to leave the studio while some SWAT guys do a raid on some building. When the shootout happens it's kind of terrible seeing the living kill the living in these movies. Zombies are also at the building where the SWAT team is and they try and kill them. The makeup I think is okay for the movie and in color, so was the Walking Dead too. A black guy and a white guy from the SWAT team try to talk, bond, and escape the SWAT team. The guy and girl meet the SWAT guys at a police station where they take a helicopter. When going around in the helicopter they see the activity on the ground of the living trying to kill the zombies. They go to refuel and when the guy gets in trouble the girl doesn't seem to help. There's also a scene where a zombie gets his part of head cut off from one of the helicopter blades too. Also black guy kills some zombie kids as well. They then discover a mall where they decide to live there. Also they lure and contain the dead so the place can be safe inside. There's also some subtext about mall shoppers as well in the movie. Even though mall are kind of dying today with all this online shopping now. They seem to enjoy the place and most of the movie I think is this. They also find out the girl is pregnant even though there's scenes of her smoking and drinking still. Then some bikers come by and try to raid the mall and Tom Savini's one of them too. The gore in this movie isn't too over the top like in Day of the Dead and I'm kind of glad. Then the guy, I think his name is Steve, gets shot, then bitten by the zombies. Black guy and girl then finish him off to save him from a fate worse than death when they get inside. The end I can say is a bit on the lighter note then in Night of the Living Dead I can tell you that. I also heard they did the movie at night when the mall was closed. Which would seem kind of hard if you think about it. Anyway this is a great movie and a classic regardless of the zombie craze. give it a watch if you can or not as scared easily."
"George A. Romero is heralded by many as the pioneer of the zombie genre and I for one have not heard of any other filmmaker that has made this much of an impact in the horror genre other than Romero. Dawn of the Dead is the first film I have from his work but I have seen the 2004 remake which I thought was good.The film was written by George A. Romero and my I felt that the writing was the reason that brought this film down. Romero was so focused on writing a great plot that the dialogue was suffered because of this. The dialogue in this film is a hit and miss for me as some of the dialogue felt too straight forward and simple that it doesn't add any personality to the character, in the beginning in particular. I enjoy the fact that Romero starts the film swiftly straight to the point with the problem already progressed significantly that the stakes are immediately high. The banter between the two men about the existence of these beings and how we can diffuse the situation. The first few minutes of the film did feel like a drag in its plot and dialogue, but when they arrived at the shopping mall then the film started to pick up and it starts to become very exciting and entertaining. Romero does try to incorporate the relation of zombies to the current society, implying that we have become victims of consumerism. This concept is very interesting and forward thinking as it still applies to societies today.Romero's direction for this film is very two sided as he wanted to make a horror film and a black comedy. The horror is fueled through slow psychological horror, as we know that the zombies are out there and they do have the potential to get in but even at their slow pace they feel even more frightening. The comedy definitely was great here as it didn't feel awkward or out of place. The funniest of moments are the shots that focuses on their faces as they don't always look that terrifying but rather it feels like an exaggerated emotion. Romero wasn't trying to make something epic but instead the terror comes from the most intimate and claustrophobic scenes. Night of the Living Dead had a much smaller budget so I assume that he was limited by budget and cannot fully express the vision in his mind. Dawn of the Dead had a bigger budget and Romero decided to do all out with the film filled with violent scenes, abundant with special effects; which I thought could be a bit tiring but rather it gave the film this personality that attracts me to revisit it in the future.The film was shot by Michael Gornick who doesn't have a lot films in his catalog. The film's cinematography is not fantastic but it does do it's job well. The image is quite warm and feels quite upbeat, which is very ironic. This kind of film would have been a great opportunity to create something incredibly dark and terrifying but this would conflict with the comedy that Romero was going for. Gornick and Romero have chosen to the camera to have shots to be very set in place or have minimal movements as this adds to the frightening feeling of the zombies coming closer and keeps the audience feeling helpless in looking away from the gore and horror, which is a decision I admire a lot.Dario Argento and The Goblins are credited as the composers for this film and they did a pretty good job here. I enjoyed the use of synthesizer in the score which I thought was pretty unique for the zombie genre. The score may be a bit melodramatic but it does add on to the weight of the plot and supports the tone of terror that Romero wanted to show. In delivering the comedy of the film, half of it comes from the elevator/shopping mall music that plays as the zombies casually walks around the mall. This approach had me laughing until the end of the credits and does leave the film with a lighter tone.There are only really 4 actors that drives the film and for the most part, they are all great in portraying their parts. These roles are not the deepest of written characters but the actors do what they can with what they are given. David Emge was good here especially heading towards the second half of the film. Ken Foree was good playing as the badass protector but at the same time he does show hints of vulnerability that makes the character feel human and not just another killing machine like the zombies. Scott Reiniger and Gaylen Ross were good but I felt they didn't stack as high as the other two actors in their roles. Foree and Emge showed a much better performance in their physical acting making the stressful scenes feel believable.Dawn of the Dead may be heralded as an instant classic for some and it's flaws that I see maybe seen as a great aspect of the film but it just didn't work with me."
"George Romero began the modern zombie movie craze in 1968 with the black and white classic, Night of the Living Dead, made for a reported $100,000. He followed up ten years later with Dawn of the Dead and $500,000, which allowed him better sets; mostly a shopping mall in Pittsburgh, and color film for all the blood and gore. Oh my, what a difference ten years and $400,000 makes. Again, an unknown virus causes the dead to rise seeking the flesh of the living.. SWAT teams and the US military battle the undead, and two of the SWAT guys, Roger and Peter, hijack a traffic helicopter with Stephen and Francine, who work at the local TV station. They land at a large mall to hide out at. Once inside, they argue with others as to staying inside or leaving. A motorcycle gang breaks into the mall to loot it. The zombies follow them inside, and all hell breaks loose. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Francine is four months pregnant, and so, she is taught how to fly the chopper. As the carnage continues, she must try to escape to the roof to escape with her unborn baby. Will she make it? You will have to watch this bloody massacre for over two hours to find out. Romero has said that his idea to use a mall was inspired by observing his fellow Americans wandering around one as if they were zombies, or just mindless consumers. The perfect gathering place for the end of the world; how appropriate."
"""Dawn of the Dead"" is the 1978 sequel to Romero's zombie classic ""Night of the Living Dead"".The story takes place several weeks after the first movie's events. The zombie attack is only getting worse. Two reporters (Francine and Stephen), and two SWAT team agents (Roger and Peter), steal a helicopter to escape the urban environment and find a place to hide till the crisis is over. They come across a secluded megamall in Monroeville, in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. They clear out the zombies and secure the mall entrances and exits.Barricaded inside the mall, they sit and wait out the attack. Unfortunately, the undead are on to them bit time and attacking in hordes from outside. What follows is a lively splatterfest and action flick that is a pretty good sequel to ""Night"". It is highly entertaining, especially if you're into the zombie sub-genre of horror, and it is by far superior to the 2004 remake."
"This movie was amazing, plain and simple. The actors were great in the roles they were given. It's as if they were living the parts they played. Roger and Peter are 2 of my favorite characters in the whole ""Dead"" series. They make an awesome, funny duo. The beginning was great, and I didn't expect the rest of the movie to keep my interest as well but it did! The biker gang was great, especially the knife/machete wielding Blades (Make-up specialist Tom Savini). For a low-budget horror movie, this was truly one of my favorite movies from start to finish, I was never bored or disappointed watching this. PS- Yes its a sequel, but it easily compares with and possibly passes Night of the Living Dead. 10/10"
"Dawn of the Dead is one of my favourite Zombie movies, George A. Romero did a outstanding job with this film and it's one of his masterpieces. The film takes place some time after Night of the Living Dead and the zombies are increasing and taking over more places, a Air traffic reporter Stephan and his executive girlfriend Fran decide to escape using the helicopter while at a building the Police have the place surrounded and soon the SWAT team move in. One of the SWAT Wille goes berserk and starts killing civilians so he's gunned down by Peter, another SWAT member. Roger a fellow SWAT member meets with Peter and they decide to leave the city. Stephan and Fran wait for Roger, Stephan goes inside the building and meets some Police officers that are also running, Roger and Peter arrive and they go off into their helicopter while the officers go off in the boat. The next day they land for fuel while the locals are hunting down the zombies with the help of the army, after encountering some of the zombies they go off into the helicopter again, they soon come across a huge Mega mall and decide to land to check it out. Discovering a storage area they stay their, Peter and Roger go into the mall to see what's down there while Fran stays with Stephan who's fast asleep, dodging the zombies while checking through the mall they get trapped inside one part of it. Stephan takes the Rifle and goes to find them, after encountering a zombie he goes into the mall section and hurries to Roger and Peter. Using a diversion they quickly escape past the zombies while one of the zombies walks off where the storage area is and soon Fran is attacked by him but as it's about to get her they come in and get rid of him. While Fran is in the bedroom the others decide to stay here since they have everything they need, Stephan then tells them that Fran is pregnant but they still want to stay. Stephan goes to Fran and she tells them that she doesn't want to stay here but Stephan explains to her that they've got it good here and should stay. The next day they make a plan to block the zombies from getting in and that's by driving the trucks near by and block the entrances, Roger and Peter go to drive the trucks while Stephan observes them from the helicopter and Fran covers them from the roof. Roger starts to fool around by shooting the zombies and running them over, and on their way to get another truck he leaves his bag with the zombies so they must go there again and get it but when trying to get in a zombie bites a chunk out of his leg, after blocking all the entrances they bandage up his wounds and they come up with a plan to cover the stairway with a fake wall so that the zombies and intruders won't know where it is and after doing that they need to eliminate all the zombies so they can move around with ease so going into the gun store they take a handful of weapons and shoot every zombie in the mall and lock all the door from the inside, once that's done the mall is safe but Roger is slowly changing into a zombie because of the bite. They put all the zombies away and the mall is theirs. They take the money from the bank in case they may need it, they get food from the stores, they have fun in the arcades, the ice rink, take clothes from the clothe store and various other things. The storage room is soon made into a huge fancy apartment full of things from the mall, when Peter is Roger he soon becomes a zombie and Peter has no choice but to shoot him. Fran wants Stephan to teach her how to fly the helicopter in case something happens and he gets injured and they need to escape. A while after teaching her how to fly the helicopter a gang of people discover the mall what they've done with it and decide to take it for themselves but they need all of them, so that night they enter the mall and go to take everything while letting the zombies get in. They go around killing the zombies and taking the stuff while Stephan and Peter take the guns and go to stop them. Trying to stop them Stephan gets chased by them and quickly hides in the elevator and climbs onto the top but one of them shoots up at the top and a bullets hit him in the arm, climbing down he gets surrounded by zombies and bitten by them. He gets them out and shuts the elevator door but when after a while he comes out as a zombie while Peter shoots some of them and they retreat leaving the mall but some of them get eaten by the zombies. Peter returns to Fran and tells her to go without him, zombie Stephan shows up and he shoots him in the head. Fran goes to the helicopter and gets ready to leave while Peter sits in the bedroom with the gun to his head ready to pull the trigger but instead he doesn't and shoots a zombie in the head then he runs out the bedroom and climbs out then quickly runs up to the helicopter and gets in then they fly off leaving the mall going to find another place to go. Dawn of the Dead is a great zombie movie in George A. Romero's Dead series and should be seen. 10/10"
"Dawn of the Dead is probably the best horror movie ever made. The sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" takes place about 3 months after zombies, or as George A. Romero (writer director)likes to call them ""ghouls"" start attacking the living. If you haven't seen ""NotLD"" go see it before watching this movie its definitely worth a peek.Taking place in a world thats falling apart, four people attempt to just stay alive by escaping to a shopping mall via helicopter. Most of the movie follows them attempting to regain control of the mall which happens to be over run by zombies. DotD is more a movie about the personal feelings of George A. Romero on consumerism and materialism. The whole idea is basically a metaphor for people who just mindlessly pass through life, and often just spend money for no reason at all.The acting is pretty much top notch except for a few moments which are actually laughable. (Watch for Steven running into a zombie at an airport... you'll know what I mean. It's hilarious... also take note how many times Fran says ""OH FOR GODS SAKES!"") Other than what I just mentioned this movie does not suffer from any over the top acting, just typically movie mistakes.DotD is a top notch horror movie that pulls no punches, definitely one of the goriest movies I have ever seen in my life. There is a scene in an apartment complete that should surprise you. There is no lead up to the gore it just happens which definitely makes it hard to get ready for when someone is torn apart by 20 zombies. I haven't really ever been frightened by this movie but I am a huge fan of horror so I think I'm just too used to it. A must see for horror fans, or gore fans in general.All the music in this movie, with the exception of one song was all written by a band ""Goblin"", and from what I can tell was written for this movie. I enjoy the bizarre music in this movie, however, I can see how it would annoy some people to no end.All in all this is my favorite movie which I have watched probably a hundred times! From the first time I saw this movie I was hooked. If you enjoy zombie movies this is THE zombie movie to see. If your a fan of horror this is probably the best horror film ever made period, though not as scary as the first ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" it still surpasses it with the fairly detailed plot and tons of social commentary. If you don't like horror films, or zombie movies, or anything to do with the apocalypse then you probably wont enjoy this piece too much, this ones for fans of the genre.-After watching this one watch ""Day of the Dead"" an amazing sequel (with none of the same characters unfortunately) and the OK final zombie film from Romero in the series so far ""Land of the Dead""9/10 because it seems to be somewhat of a cult film and I think a 10 should appeal to all audiences. This is the flagship zombie film, the best ever made."
"""Dawn Of The Dead"" is an acknowledged high watermark of late 70's horror movies in general and of zombie cinema in particular. All but the most contrarian fan-boys agree that this may very well be George Romero's masterpiece, and I am inclined to agree. The atmosphere of Dread (with a capital ""D"") descends immediately as we are introduced to the main characters in two initial segments. An ultimately over-matched SWAT team invades an inner city building and comes face to face with the living dead, most memorably in the basement, where a veritable pig pen of corpses are coming to life. A TV station struggles to stay on the air as more and more news piles in reporting that the dead are rising up and devouring the living. Without reservation, I can say that the film makes me feel like I am right there, threatened with harm which is right outside the door. When the main characters escape in the helicopter, searching for somewhere to start over again and escape the zombie plague, I feel relief and hope right along with them. The synthesized music also is very atmospheric and lends its own air of menace. Apparently Romero is acknowledged as a top notch editor who was notorious for using his own hands, a knife, and a roll of movie tape to cut his films. Well, it works great because the editing is energetic and the pacing very well suited to each scene. The action and gore scenes are visually ""wonderful"" (read; putrid, gross, perfect) and intermittently humorous, while bearing the unmistakable stamp of the great Tom Savini. I would highly recommend reading about the background of the making of this movie, or watching the well regarded extras documentaries in the expanded DVD editions. The story of the dedicated personalities and circumstances behind the making of this awesome movie makes it all the more enjoyable to experience. This is one horror movie that delivers in every respect, fires on all cylinders, grabs and holds your attention, and is worthy of all the praise that has been heaped on it over the years. Belongs in every horror fan's library without a doubt."
"Dawn of the Dead is the first zombie movie I have seen and i thought it was very good. An epidemic of zombies are rising from their graves so two Philadelphia SWAT team members go to a shopping mall that is invaded by zombies.This movie wasn't scary and the blood and guts are fake. Several scenes are packed with humour e.g the zombie pie-splatting scene, the Mexican guy that always takes his blood pressure etc.Although the blood and guts look a little fake, it can look sick, so if you have a weak stomach. Don't See this. If you don't than this is recommended. 4.5/5"
"*Dawn Of The SPOILERS* Young reporter Francine (Gaylen Ross), her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge), and two SWAT members, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reinger) manage to escape the Living Dead, who are running rampant through the whole USA, by hiding in a mall.But for how long? And when a gang of bikers bursts through the mall and begins a war not only against zombies, but against other survivors, and two of the main four get bitten, things look real bleak...Who will survive the Dawn Of The Dead? George A. Romero, the man who created the Zombie movie with the epochal 'Night Of The Living Dead', now ups the ante with this nihilist and terrifying portrayal of a society literally eating itself.Absolutely better than the dreadful 2004 retread.Dawn Of The Dead (1978): 10/10."
"This is an excellent movie. It has horrific special effects (especially for a film with as low a budget as this). It has great acting, and realistic characters. After redefining the horror genre with Night of the Living Dead"" George A. Romero released this in 1978, and he shocked audiences around the country with his no-nonsense approach to the cannibalistic monstrosities. As for the 2004 remake of this film, in my opinion, this one is much better. It has more story, more action, and more gore (so much in fact, that the distributors wanted to give it an X rating, but settled with it as ""unrated""). Keep in mind, though, when you see this movie remember that it was filmed on only $500,000, so don't expect it to have as good of special effects as the remake."
"...when there's no more room in hell...the dead will walk the Earth.Never in horror cinematic history has a tagline made me chill even before watching the film. I can remember at the tender age of five--when vhs was the ""new big thing"" and the complete and utter bliss of consumerism was wild and rampid and everything seemed like a fantasy. I slowly walked into this small independant video store with only one objective--and that was to give my imagination what it wanted--brainfood. Horror has always been a part of my life...even in my early years. I am now a grown man in his early twenties with still have the same affliction for that fantasy world as I had as a kid. George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, in my own humble hearted opinion has literaly shaped my life and my beliefs and my sense of imagination in general, whether it be in writing short stories or creating an idea from a morsel of his masterwork. As a child I didn't (nor would any child) grasp what what Romero was saying right there on the silver screen in technicolor for everyone to see. I didn't realize at the age of five that the film in general was nothing but a mere depiction of us in all our consumer lust with greed in our eyes and with shopping carts in hand ready to capture some new gadget. It is a scenerio of us slowly sliding into that inescapable pit of dept and materialism and everything that accompanies it. I thought it was amazing how when Roger (one of my all time favorite characters) was bitten, Peter pushed him around in a cart, just like he would have pushed his newly boughten goods he paid his hard earned money for.  Roger WAS ""the goods""...used up and forgotten as some toy when it performs less perfectly or not how one would like it to. Hell, go buy another one! Another scene that really hits home is when Roger is in the makeshift hospital drained and stoned on repeated shots of morphine...""We whipped 'em and we got it all!.."" Roger exclaims from his lips in victory, but little did he know that under his drug induced state was the truth...the truth that soon he would no longer live and breath and soon be useles--just like a heroine addict on the street..blinded by the drug and fueled by the money he needed for other things. This film is no average horror film. It goes deeper than that. It is what some people will call ..""a thinking man's horror film.""While Dawn of the Dead is not without its flaws, the shere determination and storyline overcomes the mistakes and makes way for one of the best experiences one could have in front of a television set. For those of you who haven't seen it...please do! And for those who have let's take our hats off to Romero for even casting this marvelous idea into his great mind..Thanx George!"
"The best walking dead movie ever made. Romero's direction and Savini's effects create a world of the undead. The acting is second rate, but would Deniro and Streep work in a film like this? If you enjoy zombie movies, or you just want to go to the mall for a couple hours, rent this one. On second thought, buy this one for your collection"
