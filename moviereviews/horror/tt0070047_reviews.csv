Reviews
"There's a lot of anxiety that goes into viewing The Exorcist, ""the scariest movie ever made"", for the very first time. And with that anxiety comes a lot of expectations and preconceived ideas about what The Exorcist *should* be. Especially for someone born after the film. Then on top of that waited years before finally seeing it.I love the Exorcist, and after exposure to God knows how many horror films, the Exorcist remains my favorite within the genre. And even from a die-hard fan I have to admit, I hate hearing ""scariest movie of all time"" associated with this movie.First of all, there's no reason to compare fright factor of films, so forget that anyone ever called The Exorcist ""the scariest movie ever made."" Take any movie  I don't care what movie  and stick a ""greatest/scariest/best"" whatever tag next to it, and you'll have audiences investing in what they *think* it should be instead of letting the film present itself for what it is. And all they see is that it is not what they expected (expectations, I might add, that are shaped by the current gimmicks and trends in Hollywood).I love the Exorcist because it dared to defy my expectations. This is not a wall-to-wall, credits-to-credits montage of scary imagery inspired by a mere scenario that's supposed to pass as a plot. This isn't a movie about that long dark corridor and something waiting to jump out of the darkness and attack (which is always preceded by a false scare featuring a cat). It's not about that cheap gimmicky scenario of X amount of people isolated from the rest of the world, with a killer/monster/ghost/whatever on the loose.The Exorcist is a very slow movie that actually features a full blown plot, its characters, and their associated arcs. The original ambition of The Exorcist was to scare the world with imagery and concepts never before seen in cinema. Shocking moments that the audience of 1973 could not believe they would ever see on the silver screen (from a major studio, no less.) After 30 years, the movie isn't so shocking because times have changed, and the success of the Exorcist has guaranteed countless imitation in all forms across all boards. However, the Exorcist is still one of the most ambition horror films ever made, because (are you ready for this?)  the Exorcist dares to tell a story.Everyone remembers the pea soup, the head spinning, the vulgarities spewed from the demon's mouth, the stairs, the infamous cut (now restored) spider walk. But I adore this movie for the things no one seems to bring up  I love the setup in Iraq where Father Lancaster Merrin detects the signs of his final showdown, and how these abstract scenes on subsequent viewings give the movie a more epic feel. I love the transition from Chris MacNeil to Father Karras walking across campus that's reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock. I became absorbed watching Father Karras caring for his aging mother and the close relationship they have, seeing him depressed and sharing a drink with a fellow priest as he discusses his own issues with faith.And what impresses me most about a movie named the Exorcist is how it seems to reject the possibility of possession and exorcism as its ultimate and final solution. The characters in the movie don't want it to be true, and in fact don't really even know about the possibility of Exorcism, thus they explore and exhaust all other possibilities (both medical and psychological). I smiled with delight (after all the hospital scenes) in that priceless moment when Chris MacNeil asks Karras, ""And how does one go about getting an exorcism?"" which stops father Karras in his tracks as he, a man of the church, looks at her as though she's lost her mind.The fact that the movie resists the temptation to jump right into the acknowledgment that Regan is possessed continues to build up the epic Good versus Evil, God versus Satan, the exorcist versus the demon, feel. Like the characters, the movie doesn't want it to be true, it doesn't want to go there and embrace that possibility, but we the audience know what must inevitably happen. And it's almost magical how the movie finally acknowledges Regan's only hope. There's no glorious fanfare nor is there boastful ultimatums, instead the movie lamentingly and silently surrenders to it as we watch Lancaster Merrin walking up the sunny garden path, staring down at a newly delivered envelope. He doesn't have to read it. He already knows what it says, as do we.The imagery then fades to an ominous foggy night as a taxi pulls up to the MacNeil place in Georgetown, then we're treated to the haunting imagery that inspired the cover art. What must be done, must be done. I love how the movie implies that Merrin has faced this very demon before through its imagery, and through the dialogue as Karras explains he's identified at least three manifestations to which Merrin answers, ""No. There is only one."" I can address more  the acting, the beautiful cinematography, brilliant makeup  but I'll stop to keep from sounding like a raving fan who over hypes every inch of everything. I'll close with these thoughts: I'm not the type of person who will watch the same movie over and over and over. Most movies I see, the specific imagery and specific ideas don't make a deep enough impression to stick with me for more than a few months. I remember the Exorcist, not because I thought it was the ""scariest movie ever made"", rather because of the wonderful craftsmanship, the fact that it dared to tell a story, and it defied my expectations.When Friday the 13th, the Grudge, Skeleton Key, and Cursed are reduced to vague memories and general ideas, I will still clearly remember the Exorcist."
"Some movies are landmarks. This is one of them.Good : There are a lot of goods that I can talk about this particular film. First off, every gothic horror, for example, The Conjuring, are inspired by this film in one way or the other. But, none of them are as good as this one. I love Conjuring 1 & 2, but that might have never existed if it weren't for this movie. So, what makes it so good? We are given a mysterious introduction to an old priest who would play a prominent role later. It gives layers to the character of young priest, which is quite interesting. The set up is done quite well. The story is being told quite well. And it has the most important aspect that most horror films today lack - the dread and actually terrifying scenes. Right from the opening credits, it feels uneasy. It tries to give us a really terrifying vibe. And it just intensifies further and further. Even the scenes having no tension don't feel like so. And, it cuts to some terrifying scenes so suddenly but smoothly that we will be exclaiming ""holy (you know what)!"". That's some true horror film. It was 1973. You had absolutely no technology or CGI. They still made an entire bed shake which looked so scary and realistic! The 180 degree turn is still an awesome effect. They did it way better, and all of it looked more realistic than CGI! It had some ideas involving Ouija board and exorcism, which are now termed as ""clichés"". Having watched so many horror films before watching this, it should've felt corny. But it felt real good. There is probably no horror movie, in particular a supernatural or gothic horror movie, that has not been inspired by this movie in some way or the other. And the ones which got as many things right as possible as in this one, were respectively better. This movie is a masterpiece!!Bad : It has sequels. Damn those pathetic sequels!! But again, good God almighty, only few people know about those stupid movies.Conclusion : It is a must watch for every horror fan. Some parts may feel clichéd to some, but that's where those ""clichés"" started. Go with a fresh mind and examine how it all started. I am optimistic that you will love it.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+"
"In late 1973 and early 1974, women and men were lined up for blocks. People were known to become ill watching it. Some fainted. Some ran out of the theater in tears. There were reports of people having to be institutionalized, and at least one miscarriage was attributed to viewing it. No, it wasn't a Rolling Stones Concert. It was a film called The Exorcist.The first time I had heard of something called The Exorcist was on late night television when the author, William Peter Blatty, was a guest on The Tonight Show. The conversation centered around how horrible some of the things in the book were. I had also seen the novel listed on The New York Times Bestseller List, and it seemed as if it would remain there forever. After having been on the waiting list for what seemed like an eternity at the local library, I was finally able to obtain a copy. It was the first book I had read in one sitting since probably Nancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase quite a few years earlier. And yes, for it's time it was filled with gut wrenching details of what happens when for some unexplained reason; an innocent girl is possessed by Satan. While reading the book I was sure that if it ever made its way to film, most of the details would certainly be either `cleaned up' or omitted altogether. As you know the film was made and it spared the movie going public absolutely nothing in the way of details.Certainly many of the people who lined up to see The Exorcist did so to watch some of the more gruesome scenes, the worst of which involved Regan's masturbation with a crucifix. Yet, the hysteria went well beyond the fact that such scenes were so vividly depicted. I think one needs to look no further than Mel Gibson's The Passion to find the answer as to why. I'm sure most of you have read the story of people leaving Mel's film in tears, some to the point of being hysterical. From most articles I have read, it seems that the majority of the audience that was moved were those people of strong religious beliefs. For many others, the depiction of the brutality in The Passion may have been uncomfortable to sit through, but weren't emotionally effected to any degree. Much of this same feeling can explain the hysteria surrounding The Exorcist. Those who had a definitive belief in Heaven and Hell, of Good and Evil, of Jesus as The Savior and Satan as the epitome of pure evil were affected by The Exorcist far more than those who were agnostic or just never had a strong belief in spiritual matters. There is no doubt though that much in the way The Passion did, The Exorcist caused many to reconsider how they felt about their faith. The Exorcist made the prospect of Satan being alive and well and a life of eternal damnation a very uncomfortable prospect. The fact that Blatty claims his book and screenplay were based on a true story seemed to give the film even more credibility.For me, The Exorcist has always been more about the never ending conflict between pure evil and pure innocence than about being an average horror story. There are many more levels to this film than what initially meets the eye. There is no doubt that while the main story revolves around an innocent young girl, Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), being inhabited by Satan himself, Blatty enhances it greatly by adding different characters in various stages of conflict. Regan's mother, Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) obviously cares deeply for her daughter. Yet she is not beyond reproach. In one scene when Reagan's father hasn't called on Regan's birthday, we see her desperately on the phone doing battle with an overseas operator. The problem is not how vicious the phone call is, but that she does it within ear shot of her daughter as if to drive the point home to Regan how worthless her father is. When, she finally does seek the aid of Father Damian Karras, we don't feel that she believes in exorcism anymore than he does, but is desperate enough to accept the fact that it is possible and will take any and all measures to save her daughter.Father Karras (Jason Miller) is a priest torn by conflict. He is ridden by overwhelming guilt for having abandoned his mother to enter the priesthood. He is torn spiritually by the confessions of those priests who seek his help as a psychiatrist, so much so that he now questions his own faith. When he states to the Bishop that `Regan's case meets all the criteria,' we know that even more than Chris, he doesn't really believe in the power of Satan to inhabit a living being in the manner that it has taken over Regan. Yet, he will do what is required of him as a priest concerned about the health of a child.Jack McGowran gives a terrific performance as the alcoholic director filming Chris's latest film in Georgetown. Kitty Winn is Sharon Spencer, the secretary who works for Chris and always seems to be in the line of fire when Chris is angry. She is always there but for all the horror she witnesses, Winn appears too bland and emotionless and her performance is probably the weakest in the film.Max Von Sydow as Father Lancester Merrin is a no nonsense aging priest. He has done battle with evil before and he shows us its effect in every scene he occupies. One could pass it off to being just good make-up but it is so much more than that as Sydow demonstrates all the nuances that brings to life a man who has faced Satan and lived to tell about it. He knows what he is up against, understands he must do it again and the consequences of what that battle may be.If I have a small complaint with The Exorcist it is in regards to the character of Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb). I have never been able to buy into the character. It is not the fault of Cobb who is his usual stalwart self in the role. The whole character should at best have only been necessary for a few brief scenes yet; he has several that go on way too long and do not add anything to the story. Even in his scenes with Chris or Damian, Kinderman is so odd that he distracts us too much from their characters and it is Chris and Damian's reactions that are more important to us, not his investigation. For all you trivia buffs out there, Blatty once sued the producers of Columbo, stating they based Peter Falk's character on Kinderman. If memory serves me correctly Blatty lost that one.As for Director William Friedken, although he won the best director award for The French Connection, for me The Exorcist will always remain his defining film. The Final half hour of The Exorcist are still as dynamic today as they were 31 years ago, French Connection car chase be damned.It seems that to many of the younger movie audiences of today, The Exorcist has become more of a joke than anything else. That's not surprising considering how many times it has been lampooned, even by Linda Blair herself in Repossessed. Yet, if they were to view the film in a more serious vein, not as just another creature feature, they may just find that there really is more to this film than a little girl spewing pea soup and spinning her head around 360 degrees. It is the ultimate battle between Heaven and Hell and Good and Evil. It is the story of the complete and total degradation of innocence. It is a study in character, and whether a man torn by the forces surrounding him, can regain his faith and his belief in God and mankind to save the life of a little girl, caught up in forces beyond her control.Call it a horror film, call it a religious film, call it what you want. For me, The Exorcist is and will always remain a classic in every sense of the word. And if I regard you as a classic of any kind I have no choice but to leave you with my grade, which for The Exorcist is an A."
"There is a reason for the hysteria and mystique surrounding THE EXORCIST. And it's called genius.Never have I seen a film matched in shock, terror, writing, or performances. This isn't a horror movie.  The film itself is both a moving and terrifying drama that takes a realistic look at what would actually happen if a young girl were possessed in modern America.  William Peter Blatty's script is amazing, bringing depth to the characters, and presenting the mystery of faith that they all deal with.  Is Regan possessed?  Is she insane?  And most importantly, Is there a God?  In the course of two hours, we see a sweet and innocent young girl become a cross masturbating, head spinning, murderous, creature.  We see a successful actress overcome skepticism to save her daughter, and we see a brilliant psychiatrist struggle with his devotion to God as a priest.Friedkin's direction is marvelous, with wonderful uses of light, dark, and color throughout the film.  Jason Miller (as Damien Karras) is beautifully subtle in his first film acting role.  Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb provide engaging supporting performances as the experienced priest who senses his impending doom, and a detective who senses something sinister is at work. Ellen Burstyn gives a brutally honest performance as a grief stricken woman trying to save her daughter.  And most of all, a 12-year-old Linda Blair gives one of the most terrifying, convincing, and beautiful performances ever shown on film.  Her range of emotion and connection to Regan are astonishing.  She deserved that Oscar!THE EXORCIST presents to us the mystery of faith in it's most raw form--the battle of good and evil.  It is an incomparable masterpiece of film, done without the aid of computers and special effects.  It relies on story and performances to give us a marvelous and terrifying piece of work.  In the end, it makes us ask ourselves what we believe, and keeps us wondering and shuddering at exactally what might be out there."
"The Exorcist is one of the best movies to come out of the 70's and deserves better than slowly descending down the top 250. It's one of those essential films you have to see in order to understand what a movie truly is and this is more than a horror film. Unfortunately there are so many people who are saying they got bored, I think because they expected a terrifying movie, people! This isn't a slasher movie, this isn't some scary Michael Myers that you can shoot, this is a story about normal people in a normal house and upstairs there is a little girl who happens to be possessed by ""The devil himself"". Faith is so strong and when it's shaken, anything in your imagination can run wild.First off the actors: Ellen Burstyn plays Chris McNeil, an actress working in Washington, D.C. on a film. She is the mother of Regan, the little girl who is possessed. I felt such sorrow for Chris, when she begs Father Karras to help her with Regan, I almost cried for her. Her daughter is not sick, this is nothing she can give Regan a pill and she'll be better. Her speech to Father Karras later on in the film: ""You show me Regan's double, same face, same voice, everything. And I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut. Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!"" sent shivers down my spine, this woman knows what Regan needs and will do whatever she can.We have Linda Blair who plays Regan and she was so great for a 12 year old actress. This little apple faced girl became one of the most frightening images of the 70's and still to this day. She's not scary because she's swearing, this little innocent girl has been taken over by forces that she shouldn't even know about. Jason Miller as Father Karras, for a man who had never acted professionally before, he was quite amazing as a priest who just lost his mother and his faith has been shaken up. Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin was so strong and he was like in his 20's playing a man in his 90's. He was robbed of an Oscar, he was so believable and just amazing during the exorcism scene.The effects? People! This was the 70's and they made a bed float! They turned this little angel's face into a hideous creature! If you watch the documentary ""Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist"", Ellen Burstyn gets slapped by Regan in the film and she had kind of a rope tied around her waist. When the stunt man pulled her back, Billy the director told the guy to let her have it and he YANKED her back hard causing real pain in Ellen's back and that was an actual scream in the movie. They froze the room to the point as were moisture got into the set and there was a layer of snow in the morning they were shooting. There was no CGI, this was the real deal and I believe could truly help the actors. Linda Blair was being thrashed up and down during one of the possessed scenes where the bracing came loose and caused slamming of metal to her back repeatedly and her screams were also very real and bone chilling.William Freidkin is the director of The Exorcist, and there was no better choice. This guy took this picture seriously, so far as to shoot a gun offstage or scream obscenities to get an actor's shocked reaction on film. He slapped almost punched Reverend William O'Malley who played Father Dyer to get him to shake during his reciting the Last Rites to Father Karras. He almost would have killed to make this picture and anyone doing it.Weither or not the set of The Exorcist was truly cursed with a total of 9 deaths linked to the film, a fire on the set with no apparent reason, and the total feeling of evil around the room, we'll never know. But The Exorcist is a true motion picture never to missed or deserve no more than the true compliments it should get! This is the film that should be shown to any aspiring film makers. It's a masterpiece of a film that's more than a mere horror flick.10/10"
"Many people complain that this movie's too slow but those are the kind of folks who only like 80-minute splatter films with characters so dumb and one-sided, you pray for the bad guy to kill them.  This monster of a drama is both beautiful and bold.  It has CHARACTERS and not simply LAMEBRAINS lined up for slaughter.  It has class and purpose.  It takes the audience into the darkest recesses of humankind and then brings them back through a message of hope and self-sacrifice.  The movie is NOT anti-religion, it's anti-evil.  Anyone who likes smart, clever, meaningful horror-drama should see this film at least twice.  It is surprisingly touching and amazingly powerful.That said, the cast deserves a hand for their wonderful performances.  Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension of a mother of the cusp of tragedy; Max von Sydow is hauntingly perfect as the story's ray of light;   Jason Miller embodies the sadness of a defeated man; and Linda Blair is far above average even at her young age.Once again, see this movie.  You won't forget it."
"""The scariest movie of all time"". Some movie goers agree and some disagree. I belong to the former group, though I would like to rephrase it to ""One of the scariest movies of all time"". For those of you who have been living in a cave for the past twenty two years, the story is of a pre-pubescent girl, Regan (Linda Blair), possessed by a demon whom purports to be the Devil himself (""Now kindly undo these straps!"").In this day and age of schlock fest horror films being relentlessly released (or spewed out for want of a better term) by the big wig studios on a quest to cash in on the latest teenage trend, this premise for a horror story may not seem so scary to most. However, it's the road we take to arrive at this supposition that makes this film stand out from the rest.The seeds of dread and fear are planted early with screen legend Max Von Sydow's Father Merrin receiving disturbing and familiar Omens of what is to come during an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.We're then taken to the setting where the real horror will begin in the Georgetown home of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), a successful divorcée film actress living with her daughter Regan. We're initially presented with a Regan who loves horses, has a close and loving relationship with her mother, is uncomfortable with the strained relationship between her parents and has the innocent demeanour and narrow vocabulary of every normal young girl.The carefully crafted and ever so gradual change in Regan's personality, the strange drawings and figurines she creates, the emergence of Captain Howdy (Regan's imaginary friend) and strange outbursts (""You're gonna die up there"") and so called physical convulsions force Chris to turn to doctors and eventually psychiatrists to try and get to the bottom of Regan's ever worsening behaviour. Her vocabulary becomes quite extensive with spine chilling, sudden maturity and her outbursts more terrifyingly violent. After exhausting all the ""somatic"" possibilities for Regan's troubles Chris desperately seeks help from world weary Jesuit Psychiatrist Priest Father Karras (Jason Miller) requesting an exorcism.By the time Karras meets Regan, any semblance of the innocent young girl has completely vanished. Karras is grappling with his faith and subsequently doubts she is truly 'possessed'. Finally convinced that an exorcism is the way to go, he seeks permission from the Catholic Church, who grant him with the condition that he perform it with the help of the experienced Father Merrin.Merrin arrives like a knight in shining armour for the ultimate showdown! A great screenplay by William Peter Blatty (based on his book), intelligent directing from William Friedken and outstanding performances from all the cast, particularly Ellen Burstyn as the traumatised mother make for a classic piece of horror that will stand the test of time. 10/10"
"For as long as I can recall, I've always possessed (no pun intended) an innate feeling that there exists outside the realm of our established dogma things that defy conventional logic. When I was in the sixth grade, I read the book, ""The Exorcist,"" which scared me senseless. The idea that the Devil could infiltrate the delicate core of one's being called a soul absolutely terrified me at such a young age. After seeing the movie, I was speechless. Have been ever since. William Friedkin's transformation of the book to the movie was superb, in my opinion. (Not all adaptations are.) Dick Smith's special effects, in contrast to today's make-up advancements in the film industry, are still able to stand the test of time. The acting was splendid, from Lee J. Cobb & Jason Miller, to Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow's limited appearance in the piece. Friedkin's slice-of-life direction enhances the essence of the fear-factor in an oddly subtle fashion, as though the viewer were actually alongside the characters in the film. Lending to the creepiness of the film is the fact that there exists a minimal musical score (Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"" does accompany two nuns strolling gingerly down a Georgetown street in autumn, their robes billowing slightly in the wind). The palpability of what happens to a young Linda Blair has astounded me for over three decades. Having been so taken with the notion that inhuman entities DO stalk the earth and have never existed in human form, I've written a couple of novels on the subject matter, myself. I liken the new version that had been released a few years ago to the last nail in the proverbial coffin of effectiveness, making this one of the best horror-genre films of all time. Simply put: I've never seen any film that remotely comes close to what this movie has done to me (in terms of frightening me senseless). Linda Blair's cute Regan MacNeil is utterly transformed into a beast which is flat-out disturbing to behold. The movie has moved me ever since I had seen it at age fourteen, and I suspect will always. Put simply, at age forty-three I still have a difficult time watching it on my own. Great job, Mr. Friedkin and crew!"
"The Exorcist is simply a masterpiece. Great Cinematography darkens the atmosphere and a superb screenplay enhances the dialog. There is plenty of excellent actors in this film as well. Loads of great performances from actors such as: Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow. I pressure you to see the re-edited one. Trust me, it's not a remake. It's a better editing of sound and picture, and even some NEW footage that is of the same quality.If you enjoy horror movies of any kind, and/or like a good drama, this film is for you. A Head-spinning performance from Linda Blair makes it even more horrific, seeing a little innocent child getting possessed by a horrid demon. Ellen Burstyn give another great performance, as a mother going through shock and worry about what is happening to her daughter. This acting is all together very powerful, realistic and leaves for a better cinematic experience overall. Other great notable parts of the movie, are the satisfying amount of good dialog, quotes, and scenes. Gut-wrenching horror conjoins with gritty drama in this absolutely awe-inspiring movie. See it for yourself if you haven't yet, you must; because it is definitely a memorable film.4 of 4 Stars"
"The Exorcist is the best horror film ever made and there is one reason for this,the subject matter is treated with dignity and respect,too many ""horror films"" are made today that just don't try,it's as if they give up half way through and fall into self  parody and amusement.the Exorcist is an exception and one of the very few good horror films around.the film works on a number of levels and is one of the few films I know of to do this i.e subliminal imagery,multiple storylines. a lot has been written about this film drawing mainly on sensationalism surrounding the films release that it would be hard for someone who has not seen the film to not have any preconceptions,but if you have not seen the film do try to keep an open mind because it will scare the hell out of you.this is also one of the rare cases where a film could arguably be better than the book it was adapted from.in my opinion the film could not have been made any better,the cast throughout are superb, the locations and production are second to none,all the characters are totally  believable and there are points in the film where you think all this could really happen and it is for that reason the film is frightening and continues to frighten people to this day....a true shocker and one that has not lost any of its impact over the years."
"Two terrible sequels and one irrelevant remake were never replaced with the original, the 1973 version of The Exorcist; and no other version will never be any more. Written for the screen and produced by William Peter Blatty, both The Exorcist movie and the novel are incident driven basis of the actual happenings from 1949.Looking at the most remarkable movies of 1973, there are 3 other important ones that the history of cinema will remember: -- A slow and touching movie from Ingmar Bergman ""Cries and Whispers"" -- Bernardo Bertolucci's depressive movie, a study of love ""Last Tango in Paris"" -- A crime story with Redford and Newman ""The Sting"". Among all and all the other movies that are produced in this year, The Exorcist stands one step further than the rest for its uniqueness on genre renewal. It's not the first movie that features the Demon in its content, yet in the Exorcist the Demon is introduced in the human level. The idea of being possessed by a spirit is used for the first time ever on the silver-screen. Horror genre featuring spirits didn't need to refer to Crime any more like it used to be in Hitchcock ages. Thus crime became a separate genre, and mostly acted conjointly with thrillers from now on.This uniqueness profits from its sound mixing, great lighting techniques and of course a perfect screenplay. Director William Friedkin was lucky to find his producer Blatty, being also the novel-writer and the idea creator. The plot and the story development goes very smoothly: From Father Merrin's encountering with the Demon Pazuzu in Iraq; to Ellen Burstyn looking for the cure for her daughter's disease, going for visits to every type of doctor... From the noises in the attic, to Regan's peeing on the rug... From decoding the Demon's speech of speaking English in reverse, to the arriving of Merrin... Both the editing and directing gave high qualities to this film.The 25th Anniversary edition DVD is in my movie collections. It's a must to have for horror fans. Either you have this version of DVD or the year 2000 version; you should check out the special features that reveals the real-life 1949 incident, the missing and the deleted scenes including the Spider-walk scene, sound mixing and sound effects tests show how they created the demon's voice and the BBC documentary: The Fear of God, all in the special features."
"What scares us more than anything? The answers are multiple : the dark, the evil, a mysterious presence, death ultimately; in fact, anything incontrollable. And when you think about it, all these elements have something in common: they refer to an unknown force whose presence is palpable. Indeed, the unknown scares, because it can't be seen, can't be controlled, therefore, can't be fought.These are the primitives fears that tortured the life of people since the dawn of humanity, and we inherited this fears in the same unconscious way our children will. We're aware of our mortal nature, and each of our fears is driven by this awareness, which is due to the biggest fear, the fear of the unknown. And the genius of ""The Exorcist"" is that it perfectly plays on these primitive instincts of ours, to provide the greatest Horror film ever made, a thrilling masterpiece of realism that'll haunt cinematic memories for ever. As soon as the Tubular bells start ringing, the film is inhabited by an atmosphere that will never desert it, a fearsome and gloomy ambiance absorbing any place we're watching the film in. Everything is directed with such confidence and meticulousness, the thrills almost come precociously. Indeed, before anything happens, we feel something WILL happen, but we don't know what. It seems like a cinematic trick, but not any director has the guts to let you wait more than almost half an hour before the oddities happen. The set-up is slow paced in ""The Exorcist"" because it's a movie that respects our intelligence, and doesn't try to provide cheap thrills. William Friedkin who had just made another realistic masterpiece, the Best Picture Winner ""The French Connection"" is so confident he gives us enough time to discover the characters, to get into their daily life, patiently waiting for the pivotal point that will join their fates. The direction, the writing are all in subtlety, and work because even though nothing happens yet, we keep our guard up, we know there's an evil presence somewhere, we can feel it.This is an old cinematic device started by directors who hadn't enough money to portray credible monster-type villains: they understood that sometimes, the scare is more efficient from the suggestion of a presence than its explicit depiction. When you see, you know, and if you know, you can control, but in ""The Exorcist"", the villain is here, but we never see him, he's like the shark from ""Jaws"" or ""Alien"", with a slight difference, he's not visible because he controls the body of a poor little girl. Linda Blair, as the demonically possessed Regan MacNeil , is so convincing, it broke my heart to see how the evil can have so devastating effects on a pure little soul. And the tragedy of Regan is the torment of her mother, Chris, Ellen Burstyn, perfect as a totally helpless woman, incapable of saving her little girl. And this is the fascinating aspect of the film, more than a horror drama, it also works as a thrilling mystery. A mystery where the Lieutenant Detective Kinderman, Lee J. Cobb in one of his great last roles, is the one who investigates about the strange phenomena that occurred and acts as a bridge between the victims and the priests.So many questions are raised in the beginning, we understand that sooner or later, we'll have an exorcism. Well, it's the title, isn't it? But the set-up is necessary. The parallel stories where we're transported into the universes of Father Damien Karras, portrayed by Jason Miller, and the iconic Father Merryl, Max Von Sydow, challenge our patience: we can't wait for the exorcism ... but without the build-up, the climax would be worthless. It's a movie where any flaws can be caused by an impatience from the director, an eagerness to distract the masses with thrilling moments, but a big impatience could have ruined such a magnificent and ambitious project. And ""The Exorcist"" would never have been the masterpiece it is without this patience. However, this would never have been such an iconic horror masterpiece without the few horrifying moments that punctuate the movie between the set-up and the climax. And by horrifying, I won't give any clues, let's just say it works on every level: visual, sounds, atmosphere, cinematography, dialogs, special effects, and of course, timing, since all these effects come at the least expected moments, provoking reactions in total symbiosis with the characters. We feel and fear for them, as the realism implies that it could even happen to us. This is no Hollywood, this is true horror.Lately, the American Film institute listed the Top 100 movies and I must admit I was shocked not to see ""The Exorcist"" in the list... it's a classic, probably the most horrifying horror film ever made. It has everything, a dazzling cinematography incarnated by the iconic shot of Father Merryl's shadowy silhouette coming from the mist, an unforgettable villain, and of course shocking moments where the make-up, the visual and sound effects prove how vital they are for such a genre that relies so much on realism. But this realism would have been nothing without the genius of the script and the masterful direction, that could finally let the film exude all its greatness in the last act, one of the most unforgettable climactic sequences ever, putting ""The Exorcist"" among those films that transcends the simple act of watching, becoming more of experiences.And this is why I waited for years and years before finally getting to watch ""The Exorcist"", one of the few movies that scared me even before watching it. And all I can say is that it met my expectations. And watching it at night (with someone, I would recommend) gets more hypnotic and absorbing after each viewing  ""The Exorcist"" is a must-see and ... be careful, any second, it can surprise you, really "
"Stunning visuals, effects and overall horror for 1973. The characters are very strongly portrayed and the feeling of hopelessness is ever-present throughout the movie. Even though some scenes are outright shocking and provocative, there is also a strong element of the uncanny present. This is a very haunting movie that still shocks, amazes and intrigues after all these years."
"I recently revisited this film on Blu-ray after some 45 years. It still rates as one of my favourite horror films, one of my top ten films and a masterpiece of film making. Beautiful photography, great locations, sets, special effects and acting.
It still stands up as a great film today"
"A young girl becomes possessed by a demon. Her skin becomes a grayish color and stays that way. Two Catholic priests are asked to remove this demon from her. While demanding that the demon leave her body, some of her skin rips open and her head even spins around. An image of a demon appears luminating across from them over the girl in her bed on her knees, wincing. The image almost looks like a hologram. In another scene she does the crabwalk down the stairs. What are her parents going to do? Will they ever get their little girl back? Watch The Exorcist to find out."
"I've never really been much of a fan of horror films because I've never been able to suspend my belief long enough to let a monster scare me. To me psychological demons are much more effective than overdone makeup jobs. I prefer The Haunting with Claire Bloom, or The Shining with Jack Nicholson. But the all-time classic has got to be The Exorcist. One of the reasons The Exorcist always scares the bejesus out of me is because it treats an epistemological subject very seriously, even when the one character you'd expect to step forth willingly, young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), does his best to dissuade Ellen Burstyn that her daughter is possessed by a demon. Of course, by that time Karras has already confessed to a fellow priest that he's started to lose his own faith because he realizes that the problems he has to deal with of his congregation are too much for one man, especially a man who keeps neglecting his own mother during the last days of her life. I think one of the reasons this is such a successful film is that the concept of a demon is treated as intangibly as our imagination's reach: How WOULD the devil deal with us if confronted? By reading each of our souls, finding whatever carefully hidden secrets there are and spewing them back in our faces as spiritual ammunition. Not only that, but when you see Regan (Linda Blair) in the opening scenes gently horseplaying around with her mother and her sister, the charm and goodness she radiates leaves you completely floored when she finally does become possessed and turns into a creature so horrible that you forget all about Regan. The lynchpin is having Max von Sydow cast as the aging priest who comes to finish off the work that Father Karras has started. Von Sydow who has been Ingmar Bergman's spiritual warrior for so many of his films dealing with the epistemological nature of the universe. And credit must go to Mercedes McCambridge for supplying the voice of the demon.I think The Exorcist is one of the best ""lit"" and photographed films of all time. The use of shadow is brilliant; very low key (simple things like showing a lit hall, yet having the far stairway at the END of the hall not lit...very subtly eerie stuff) yet incredibly evocative. I mean, the shadows damn near have colors. Director of Photography Owen Roizman, whose work can be seen in ""The Addams Family"" and ""Grand Canyon,"" shot ""The Exorcist."" Roizman's credits include such famous titles as ""The French Connection,"" ""Network,"" ""Tootsie,"" ""Three Days of the Condor,"" ""The Electric Horseman"" and ""Havana."" In a movie that took 180 days to make (three times the average), the exorcism alone took three months-and on some of those days the crew felt lucky to get one shot. That was because director William Friedkin wanted to make it visually clear that the satanic spirit inside the possessed girl had made the room unbearably cold. A refrigerated set representing her bedroom was constructed on a sound stage, and air conditioners worked all night to lower its temperature to 40 degrees below zero. ""When we set up the lights in the morning, that would raise the temperature to around zero, which was necessary if we were going to be able to see the frost on the actor's breath,"" Roizman explained. ""We also kept the humidity very high. It was an unbelievably uncomfortable way to work.""Look closely using stop-action laserdisc to reveal the flash-frames of Satan's face, which Friedkin inserted almost subliminally at two places, and to reveal a subtle double-exposure in which the evil spirit seems to peer out through Blair's eyes. There are semi-subliminal single-frame shots in this film: when the priest is dreaming of his mother coming up out of the subway, there is a single frame shot of a face (Eileen Dietz), painted black and white, grimacing. There are two other places where this image is supposedly displayed: when Regan, lying on the bed, turns to look at Father Merrin and Father Karras, and just after the head-turning scene. Do not watch this alone."
"More than thirty years on, The Exorcist remains a very powerful film and was a cinematographic milestone in 1973. Repeated duplication of the genre has, no doubt, 'desensitized' a new generation of movie-watchers, though it remains an unnerving masterpiece. It is not difficult to understand why the film generated such a seismic global impact all those years ago, since it imposed an unprecedented sensory attack on the viewer. Regan's vile physical appearance, combined with her vile language and blasphemous diatribe sent a shock wave around the world. Moreover, many people seemed to believe the claims that the film was based on a true story and could therefore actually happen to them. Electricity consumption must have soared for several months in 1973 as people who had seen the film slept with their lights on! It is still not a film I would feel comfortable watching before going to bed. On another level, I found parts of it profoundly moving and actually cried at the end when Regan was finally released from her possessor and wept in the arms of her mother and Father Damien, having lunged himself through a window and down a precipitous flight of steps, managed to find just enough life in himself to indicate that he had retained his faith and repented of his sins by motioning his fingers in the sign of penitence when comforted by a distraught colleague. Possibly the only thing that lets the film down if one really sits and thinks about it is the underpinning concept that an ancient demon which had existed since the dawn of time should wish to possess the body of a twelve year old child and emit a string of juvenile profanities. But then the film was designed to shock all along!"
"I was influenced into watching this film after maybe the 100th listen to Mike Oldfield's masterpiece ""Tubular Bells"" (the full, 48-minute album, not the 4-minute edit!), which was used in this movie's soundtrack. I wasn't exactly frightened or scared by the movie. I was expecting something gory and gruesome in this movie, but oh, was I wrong. And that's good, because I don't like movies that are gratuitously gory and gruesome. This movie is anything but gratuitous. I wasn't scared, but I was amazed and fascinated by the atmosphere, intelligent story and masterful filmmaking. It feels really genuine, and there are maybe 2 or 3 movies I have seen that felt genuine. It's a beautiful story about faith, and deals with the ""good vs. evil"" scheme in an unusual way. There are so many layers to the story, it's difficult to discuss them all in one or two paragraphs. Suffice to say, all of those different elements come together seamlessly. The story is beautiful. The build up of tension is truly gripping. It is not scary, it's disturbing. Those looking for gory scarefests should look somewhere else. I was truly intrigued by the movie, and the glorious resolution was both shocking and uplifting. Did good defeat evil, after all? That's up for the viewers to decide.A haunting movie, this is - especially for Mr. Oldfield, whose ""Tubular Bells"" would haunt him for 30 years."
"This known story concerns about a mother (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter (Linda Blair), the latter is possessed and two Fathers , Karras (Jason Miller) and Merrin (Max Von Sidow) attempt to free Regan MacNeil from possession by the devil . Meanwhile , a Police Inspector (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the weird events . And the priests suffering incredible risks trying to unravel mystery of demon living inside Regan .This is a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story, based on a supposedly true flick . The movie begins well and grows more and more until the scary and eerie finale . Top-notch picture, thanks to fine acting , tight pacing , well mounted edition and skillful special effects with magnificent make-up by Dick Smith . Creepy acting by Linda Blair , due to death threats against Linda Blair from religious zealots who believed the film ""glorified Satan"", Warner Bros had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film's release . On the first day of filming the exorcism sequence, Linda Blair's delivery of her foul-mouthed dialogue so disturbed the gentlemanly Max Von Sydow that he actually forgot his lines . The script is awesome , the acting excellent and the direction by William Friedkin plenty of good pace and conviction . Enjoyable secondary cast such as Lee J Cobb , Kitty Winn and Jack McGowran who died at the time finished the movie and added a legend about Exorcist's curse . Dark cinematography in sinister and mysterious atmosphere by Owen Roitzman and frightening musical score adding Mike Oldfield's soundtrack ¨Tubular bells¨ . The tale is rated ¨R¨ for graphic violence and profanity but contains gore and guts . Reiussed in 2000 by means of a special edition by director with ten minutes approximately additional footage with new amazing scenes as Regan downing stairs .Followed by two sequels and numerous imitations , in 1977 ¨the Heretic¨ by John Borman with Richard Burton , deemed awful and in 1990 titled ¨The Exorcist III¨ by William Peter Blatty with George C Scott, Brad Dourif , Ed Flanders and Nicol Williamson . Furthermore, spawned two prequels starred by a young Father Merrin , Stellan Skarsgard , and set in Africa , both of them directed by Paul Schrader and Renny Harlin ."
"Among the most authentic horror ever made with shockingly well done practical effects! Best of everything, Regan (Linda Blair) and Damien Karres (Jason Miller) were so damn good! Nothing to judge about this incredible film, it's better than hundreds of horrors out there especially possession wise it's spot on with grossness and very disturbing satanic aspects. Christians wouldn't be happy to watch this lol."
"This is a very highly rated horror movie for a good reason, when it was realised it broke the mould of everything that preceded it, and set the standard for the horror genre for decades to come; because of this it should retain its place Movie history forever.The sheer terror this movie instilled in people, during the year of its release is even today unmatched by anything. Time, however has altered its effect on its audience, we simply are not as easily shocked as we used to be.For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet, my advice is this, approach it with an open mind, and remember when it was made, this is the only way you will appreciate it for what it is.Difficult for new audiences to appreciate, but it is still a classic, time won't change that.8/10"
"One of my all time favorites! This is a classic horror film, from the content, to the lighting, editing, sounds, and special effects. The lighting is that of a classic horror film using lack of lighting and shadows as a trademark. Other lighting effects were used as well to add to the overall feel of the movie. The editing was flawless helping to add to the overall content of the film. The sounds were amazing! The sound effects used during the ""demon"" scenes make the film believable. While the special effects and editing used again during the ""demon"" scenes seemed effortless, making the film as a whole truly convincing. What an overall amazing classic horror film!"
"This one has lost none of its power to shock or terrify.You've heard of the head spinning round, the green vomit, probably even the crucifix masturbation scene.That doesn't prepare you.It's not the material itself that makes it so shocking, although, over forty years later, even the language retains an edge. I've still never heard that variation of the c-word in any other movie, I don't think. It's the direction, which always takes you by surprise, which lulls you into a state of security it punctures again and again until finally letting the horror take over like a bad dream you can't wake up from.It's the screenplay, too. This is a movie about people. About people suffering an unspeakable trauma. About people driven to the edge where the supernatural meets them.It's not about special effects or shocking violence.The characters live and breathe, you feel what they feel, even the disbelief.The Exorcist carries you along. It takes you to places you don't want to go, working its magic in ways you can never fully understand.And it remains shocking and terrifying."
"The Exorcist (1973): Dir: William Friedkin / Cast: Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb: Terrifying masterpiece based on the book by William Peter Blatty. There are many Biblical accounts where Jesus himself drove demons out of people, so an exorcist is obviously someone who rids what doesn't belong. Ellen Burstyn stars as an actress whose daughter is possessed by demonic forces. After the shocking image of her daughter screaming atop a shaking bed, she seeks professional help. When doctors fail in finding answers it is suggested that a Priest see the girl. Intelligent, shocking with a sense of insight where Burstyn asks the right questions regarding exorcism. Quite an accomplishment for director William Friedkin who previously made another masterpiece in The French Connection. Burstyn brilliantly mirrors frustration mixed with fear. Linda Blair is both sympathetic and commanding as the possessed victim. Jason Miller plays a troubled Priest whom questions his faith after his mother's death. Lee J. Cobb steals moments as a police inspector. Then there is Max Von Sydow is compelling as the exorcist who sensed the demonic force in the film's opening and ultimately understands the standoff he will eventually face. A masterpiece in horror with excellent makeup and spellbinding measures of faith. Score: 10 / 10"
"When I reflect back on the movies of the 1970's, I'm struck by how many of them helped reinvigorate their respective genres. There was ""Star Wars"" for fantasy, ""Alien"" for sci-fi, and ""Jaws"" for the shark crowd, though I don't think that's really a genre. For horror fans, ""The Exorcist"" was the one that had everyone talking in 1973, and not only talking, but lining up around the block to get a chance to see it. In fact, the first time I tried, the person directly in front of me in line was the last one allowed in for that showing.When I finally did get to see it, the experience left a marked impression. It was fascinating, horrific, sensational and scary all at the same time. Having read the book, I wondered how much liberty would be taken with the story, but it was pretty much all there. At the time, hands down, it was the most frightening film I'd ever seen.The movie played last night as part of AMC's Halloween Fest, and though largely sanitized for TV, the impact of the film is still alive and well. It's a movie that plants a nagging seed of doubt in one's mind - what would happen if Satan himself could take over the body and soul of an innocent young girl? The gradual unfolding of the parallel stories in ""The Exorcist"" are built on credible real life situations, so that by the time Linda Blair's demon face appears on screen, you're ready to grab the holy water and say a prayer.Now if you're a younger viewer born of a more recent era, I'll grant that the film might not have the same effect. Though Blair's possession makeup was visually stunning at the time, special effects since then have far surpassed that effort. But it had to start somewhere, and as a precursor to virtually everything that followed, this was the one to top. And when Regan's head spins, yikes!, but I thought mine would too. For 1973, that was an incredible piece of work, with visuals that stay with you long after the film is over."
"For those who watched this film on the big screen when it was re-released and thought it was 'comical, funny, not disturbing nor scary' are  just do not understand the complexity that surrounds this movie. Back in '73, no one was expecting a film of this kind, and I know it has been said many times but it WAS way ahead of its time. A time where cinema was in its infancy, religion was practiced on a larger scale than today and showing such violent, graphic and disturbing scenes was not thought of as being possible, one can understand why it has been banned for so many years.I recently watched this movie (at night, before bedtime) and it really left me thinking of how such horrifying scenes could be shown and portrayed in such a way. There were many scenes that would not get out of my head (for those who have seen the movie would know what scenes they are). I could not sleep that night and that hasn't happened since I saw Nightmare On Elm Street Part 1 when I was 6!What makes things worse is that there are well known cases where  people have been possessed by the devil or a supernatural being, which leads them in doing evil deeds.When you mix a horror movie with religion on such a large magnitude, things can heat up and become very unpleasant."
"Almost 40 years has passed since ""The Exorcist"" was released and it still is a haunting, exciting, thrilling and frightening horror movie. Lists after lists are made to elect the best horror movie of all time and this film always manage to get to the Top of almost every single list. Not only that: it's also an very complex dramatic film with a compelling story. A story of a devoted mother to save her teen daughter of a strange possession.After finishing the filming of a movie the actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) finds herself with an awkward situation after her adorable daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave differently. She is taken to all the best doctors but nothing is found and doctors suspicion is that the kid may have a brain tumor. But after all the medical treatment fails and when Regan's starts to move frantically Chris is told to get a bigger help: a priest to exorcise what possessed her daughter. Father Karras (Jason Miller, incredible acting in his film debut) is called, but he himself is a tormented man, who has recently loss his elderly mother, almost faithless and with few skills to perform an exorcism. Even with all that he agrees to see the girl who has increasingly gone worst. She vomits, masturbates with a crucifix and says countless bad words and profanation. Karras's verdict: she's possessed by Pazuzu, a mysterious and powerful demon. But this demon has a weakness and this weakness is Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow in a very aged makeup), or better saying The Exorcist. Father Merrin knows everything about exorcisms and demons and he knows how to fight it. Even with all this knowledge (as it is showed in the beginning of the movie when he's in Iraq investigating an occurrence) you can feel that he has some fears, (his hands shaking) but he'll do everything to kill the demon and save the poor girl. The last 40 minutes with Karras and Merrin together performing the exorcism in that freezing and haunting bedroom is priceless, scary and the best horror moment of the 1970's. I must salute director William Friedkin for his efforts on present us a movie greater in its genre different of everything seen before. He was mean with actors to create realism but he get what he wanted and the audience was terrified by those images (Ellen Burstyn's face when she was thrown to the floor; Jason Miller's face after the vomit comes right into his face which wasn't supposed to happen). On the technical side of ""The Exorcist"" an interesting thing must be noticed: all the horror moments are shown without music. This works really great, it's not a manipulated movie where a soundtrack must be added to create tension. And without the music it was much more scarier and fun to watch, listening to all the strange sounds created by the sound group (Won Oscar). Makeup effects and visual effects are stunning and many of it it's not dated or old-fashioned. Impressive! About the screenplay: William Peter Blatty writer of the original book and the film's writer created a whole new thing here. The drama, the horror and even some humor are perfect. Although I think that some scenes, characters and clues aren't well explained, there's too much mystery. For example, we heard that the film director (Jack McGowran) died on the long stairs. This scene isn't showed and if it was it would be too frightening and unforgettable. After that the movie lover detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb, very good and funny) starts a investigation about the event. Then he gets some clues about many things he didn't even saw. The public may wonder how did he get to that evidence or clue. Two moments I would like to see or questions to be answered: Who puts the crucifix under Regan's bed? And what happened to Father Merrin in that bedroom after he leaves Karras and exorcise the girl alone? Not only the technical team worked well. All the actors have fantastic performances: Burstyn, Cobb, Miller, Sydow, Blair, even not professional actor the Reverend William O'Malley has a great performance here, and at last Mercedes McCambridge who plays the devil's voice (one thing I hated in the Portuguese dubbing version is that her voice was made by a man). Even being the biggest blockbuster of 1973 it only won 2 Academy Awards (Adapted Screenplay and Sound), and it deserved the award of Best Picture cause it was greater than ""The Sting"". And it must get a higher rating on IMDb's Top 250 list. This movie is awesome, one of the very few horror movies to still shock me, to not be dated or cheesy. If you haven't watched yet or didn't find time to watch it run and buy it if you can. The power of this film compels you to watch it now and over again. Must see film for horror fans and for movie lovers just like Lt. Kinderman. 10/10"
"The Exorcist was a movie that I had been interested in seeing since i was in middle school. I was rather intrigued about what is considered to be the scariest movie of all time. Having recently seen it for the first time, I can say that it's probably not exactly scary in terms of modern horror movies, but I knew that going into it. Older horror movies favored slow build-up and dread over jump scares. They work better for repeat viewings, versus getting jump scared once and not even flinching on the second viewing. Despite the creepy elements, what really stood out to me about the movie was the sheer craftsmanship of the whole thing. This is one of the best made movies I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, particularly from Linda Blair as Regan. The make-up done on her is iconic. The effects still hold up for the most part. The atmosphere is top notch, you always feel that something is off,even in the calmer moments. The only issue I feel worth mentioning for someone who hasn't seen it is there are quite a few slow scenes of people talking, but even then the actors are giving such good performances it hardly matter.The Exorcist is considered by many to be the scariest movie of all time, and if it's not quite that, it definitely stands as one of the best made scary movies ever."
"What's remarkable about The Exorcist, especially when you compare it to other horror films, is its patience. It takes the time to calmly develop the ordinary home life of a modern postnuclear family, letting you get comfortable in the setting, and then things slowly get stranger and stranger, until eventually everything you knew has been upset or overturned.There's a fear of the future here, of a new deviancy that the older generation can neither understand or control, which very much positions The Exorcist in the social battles of its age, possibly even as a backlash against the youth revolt of the 1960s. But there's also a more universal fear here -- the fears of parenthood, and the unshakable notion that your child might turn out to be a monster and you would be responsible.More than this social commentary, what stands out is the excellence of execution -- the note-perfect direction, pacing, cinematography, and acting. None of this is very flashy, but it all has a kind of technical skill that makes The Exorcist a terrific movie, and one of those rare gems that can be admired for both ideas and craftsmanship. It's considered a classic for a reason, and should absolutely be included in the canons of not only the horror genre but the New Hollywood era of major studio art films."
"The Exorcist is one of the scariest films of all time and in 1973 it was a smash hit and now it is a movie that people even today are talking about and you can't call your self a horror fan unless you have seen this classic. the plot follows two priests who attemt to stop a demonic presence in a 12 year old girl and one of the younger priests questions his faith and must trust in his faith to stop this demon.
the cast includes Ellen Burstyn,Max von Sydow,Lee J. Cobb,Kitty Winn,Jack MacGowran,Jason Miller and Linda Blair it's a great cast and they work so well together and Linda Blair gives a amazing preformace as the possesed girl.
Personally I love the exorcist and I think that it is one of the best horror films of the 70s and all time and it was before any of the horror movie cliché's of horrror movies from the 80s which uses cliché's quite a bit so overall it was a ground breaking film and will always be amazing."
"I always cringe a little when I read some people's review of the 1973 classic the Exorcist. There is simply no second place movie in the horror genre that even comes close to this ultimate classic. The Omen?, Rosemary's Baby? The Amityville Horror? the Blair Witch Project? The Exorcism of Emily Rose? Psycho? The Rite? Not even the sequels Exorcist II, III, Exorcist The Beginning 2004 hold up to the original. There is nothing currently even close in second place!!! I have often thought how modern computer technology in 2011 could improve the 1973 classic. Other than inserting additional subliminal images, it might be close to impossible to improve on what was depicted in the 1973 movie for the following reason: What an audience member saw in the 1973 movie ACTUALLY HAPPENED. William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin physically created what the audience saw. It would be difficult to improve on reality. I admit, the head spinning 360 degrees might be improved upon slightly. This is really *only* part of the 1973 film that could stand some minor improvement; the movement looks a little 'mechanical'.Again, I ask: What is in close second place to the 1973 Exorcist? A better question is: What has surpassed the 1973 classic? In almost 40 years, there is nothing to even come close to surpassing the original Exorcist. Without belaboring the point, I respectfully rest my case. Purchase the BluRay release and turn off all the lights and turn up the sound... This movie is simply a brilliancy without peer at this time in movie history."
"The Exorcist is widely regarded to be the scariest movie of all time. Personally, I would put it a little differently. Instead of calling it the scariest movie of all time, I think that it would be more accurate to say that it's the best horror movie of all time. These may be just two different ways of saying the same thing, but I think that there is a notable difference. I just watched The Exorcist again, and I experienced the nervousness and tension and fear that it was meant to cause and I jumped a few times, but I've watched several other horror movies that have caused those same feelings  The Shining, Pet Sematary, The Sixth Sense to a certain extent, even the remake of The House on Haunted Hill had a few quality scares. But I think that the thing that sets The Exorcist apart is that everything was just done right. The acting was great, the story was unique and well presented, the gruesome special effects were skillfully crafted, even the gore and the sickening profanity were put into the film with good reason and with good results. It's so rare to see a horror movie come along (and it gets rarer and rarer as time goes on) that is actually worth watching, and when one comes along that is absolutely ground-breaking, like The Exorcist, then it's a huge cinematic event. The Exorcist is just as timeless as horror films get, and it should be noted for its style and its effectiveness.  There have been so many imitations of this film that have popped up over the years (which is to be expected, because it created so many possibilities), but none of them, not even any of the sequels, even come close to the greatness of the original. Not only is it original and unique, but it also contained some stunning performances, particularly on the part of Linda Blair as Regan, the 12-year-old girl who was the subject of the exorcism. There were some frankly shocking things that she did for the film, and the brilliant special effects and make-up added to that to make Regan's possession amazingly realistic, which is probably the most remarkable thing about the film. Another thing that was done especially well in The Exorcist was the sound effects. Probably one of the main reasons that the movie is so scary is because it is so unexpected and therefore so unsettling to hear some of those noises come from a little girl. William Friedkin's skillful but relentless directing style clearly played a large part in the convincingness of the final outcome, which stands as one of the definitive films in cinematic history."
"A classic among horror movies. Clever, well-planned plot. Solid direction by William Friedkin. Friedkin builds the tension masterfully. Incredible suspense and a very sinister and eerie feeling. Great shock value tooThe result is a very scary movie, and one which reminds you that horror movies don't have to be b-grade schlock, they can be works of art.Good performances all round. Three of the cast got Oscar nominations: Ellen Bustyn (leading actress), Linda Blair (supporting actress) and Jason Miller (supporting actor). No nomination for Max von Sydow but his performance is spot-on and the movie made his career."
"I have just realised a couple of weeks ago that The Exorcist is probably the only horror classic I haven't seen. I mean I've seen Dracula, Frankenstein, Psycho, Halloween, The Thing, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Thing, even stuff like Friday The 13th. So when I heard how many people considered it the scariest movie ever made (and even after I told friends I watched it they said they couldn't get through it) I was intrigued. To this movie's credit while it isn't my favourite horror movie, I will say it definitely makes my top 10 and maybe my top 5.So the plot, an actress is in the middle of a film shoot and despite problems she has a loving 12 year old daughter and paid people to help around the house so things, while not perfect I'll say they're pretty good. Until her daughter begins acting strangely by one minute being... well, herself and another minute being a borderline psychotic brat that uses profanity frequently, she has her bed shake and sometimes loses control over her body from peeing on a rug to violent spasms (sorry that's the best way I can describe it) and her crab walking down stairs. The mother, when this starts and only the profanity, psychotic brat personality change, bed shaking and bodily problems are present decides to consult medical and psychiatric help and all the doctors help go nowhere with finding out what the f#ck's going on and as things worsen and get stranger even from what I've described they decide to suggest exorcism (which looking things up I'm shocked is actually used medically).I'll say what my problem is with this movie. Every scare is parodied in some way by pop culture. I'll say I was on the edge of my seat while watching it but I knew the head spinning, the projectile vomiting, making stuff move and all that would be coming at some point in the movie and it's a shame because while it does give off a creepy tone regardless, I don't think there's much left in terms of scary scenes.Okay, my compliments. First of all, having me buy a realistic depiction of Demonic possession is something that the screenwriters should be congratulated for (which looking at the awards... they were). It does well in easing people into believing the situation by having the reaction to the Demonic possession not be something that they just leap onto. The make-up should congratulate themselves not just for Reagan's Devil face but for making a 44 year old Max Von Sydow look almost exactly like he would in old age. That and I really love the sound design, in most of my favourite horror movies there's usually an uncomfortable silence in some scenes that builds on the suspense and fear and while that maybe apparent here they add so much more to it.If you want to see it then I'll say do it. It certainly has reasons for being considered a horror classic and it has a lot to it that I would say would be worth the look even now after pop culture has parodied most of the scary scenes. I heard people ran out of the theater screaming and while that might be lost a little bit over time (although to be fair I didn't watch it in complete darkness on a huge screen so maybe that's the reason) it still has a lot to offer if you're looking for scares and to add the fact that it does do a good job in making a demonic possession in the everyday world seem believable."
"Without a doubt, 'the Exorcist' is one of most terrifying movie ever made. With a minimum of special effects, director William Friedkin and his small crew, including make-up artist, Dick Smith, art director, Bill Malley, cinematographer Owen Roizman and others, has made the existence of demons and the reality of possession into a realistic scary watch. It absolutely terrified theatre audiences when it came out, as some people went into convulsions, fainting or shock. It was even report, that a movie goer attacked the screen in an attempt to kill the demon and others got possession by it. Mass hysteria led to paramedics being called to some theatres, and others were picketed in protest but for me, even years after I saw this movie, I still have nightmares of the imagery, it use. It remains unparalleled in its ability to make the most confirmed atheist horrified by its depiction of primeval, mystic evil. It's really that compelling. Loosely based on a true-story of the possession of Roland Doe, and Assyrian and Babylonian mythology culture. The film and the best-selling novel of the same name by author William Peter Blatty in which it was adapted from, tells the story of Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), a young daughter of a movie actress, Christie MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) whom started to develop very odd symptoms of sickness and increasingly aggressive and violent behavior. After not finding a rational explanation of the cause of the illness, Chris seek the help of two priests, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) & Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow) to explore the possibility of an exorcism. Without spoiling the movie, too much, several versions of the film was released with different cuts, due to its controversial content. Some of them, were edited to cut out some of the more obscenely scenes like the notorious crucifix-masturbation scene, the spider-crawling moment and the bleeding Virgin Mary statue shot, others not. Instead, they added to it, inserting new or delete unused footage. Despite that, this film is still notable for being one of the biggest 'R' rating box-office successes of all time even with all the leftover controversial content, like depictions of desecrations, graphic gory self-mutilation, and crude harsh language. To get the best version, seek the 2010's 'The Exorcist' (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) on Blu-ray version as it has everything to get through the film, including restored and remastered soundtrack, both with Mike Oldfield's unforgettable song 'Tubular Bells' and the three pieces from Lalo Schifrin's rejected score. Anyways, one thing, I didn't really like, how this movie is how much, Friedkin went to some extraordinary lengths to get realistic reactions. From what I heard, from the crew, he was a jerk to work with, often shooting guns and slapping his actors. He even went so far as to put Blair and Burstyn in harnesses and have crew members yank them violently, causing injuries like breaking Burstyn's coccyx, which led to permanent injury to her spine. Not cool! Not cool at all! Suspense was also heightened by tales of a cursed film set, whichexperienced mysterious fires, hospitalized, and even death. Even with that, I think the film deserve ever Oscar nomination, it got that year including Best Picture. All of the acting in it was great. Burstyn was amazing as the mother of Regan, showing not only a sense of fear, but her wiliness to take some real physical bumps. She really deserve the Best Actress nomination. For Blair, while she wasn't the one who did the voice of the demon as that was Mercedes McCambridge; she did help deliver the best performance with her body language. Her transformation to the evil demon, Pazuzu is stunning. The things, the filmmaker put her body, through were rough. Plus, due to death threats against Blair from religious zealots who believed the film ""glorified Satan"", Warner Bros. had bodyguards protecting her for six months after the film's release. That proves, that she deserve her nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. Nevertheless, I still glad to hear that McCambridge got credit for her role as the demonic voice after not getting it, for a very long time. That legendary radio actress did a lot for this film. The way, she alter her vocalization by bounding herself, chain smoking and swallowing raw eggs, is crazy! Furthermore, the actress gave up sobriety as she knew alcohol would distort her voice even more, and create the crazed state of mind of the character. The extremes which the actress put herself through to gain authenticity—still haunts the director to this day. That legendary radio actress did a lot for this film. Miller's performance in this film is a little bit more, questionable since Friedkin really had to go extremes to get a required startled reaction from him. I really didn't think, he stood out, that much to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. From what I heard, the actor seem hard to work with, as he felt too disgust, and depress, while filming this movie. It shows in the footages, they use. Don't get me wrong, Miller isn't bad actor, but he wasn't great. If anything, Sydow's character is more memorable. I'm surprised, he wasn't nominated. However, I really didn't think the movie need, all of those scenes in Africa with his character as it expose too much of the backstory. It really felt like time wasting. It really took the movie, forever to get to the possession with all the establishment shots in Georgetown. The movie has really bad pacing issues. Also, I didn't like how Reagan started to feel ill, after playing with an Ouija board. It felt too clichés even in the 1970s. Even with that, overall, it still hold the benchmark for being one of the best horror films ever. It's still a must-watch."

"This is one of the scariest movies of all time. The first time I watched it, I was 12 years old and I was with some friends and with my brother. We all were pretty scared with this story of possession and horror of the poor girl named Regan Teresa MacNeil,specially because all the time they were showing the connections with demon's statues, figures and faces. Reading the trivia section, I can see that many things were quite spooky and hard even for the actors and actresses, like when they say that the '' Director William Friedkin went to some extraordinary lengths to abuse the cast. He fired off guns behind the actors to get the required startled effect. He was said to have slapped one actor across the face before rolling the camera. He even went as far as to put Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn in harnesses and have crew members yank them violently.''But Linda Blair, even know until today for her role as Regan and almost with her career ended, was an amazing actress who was spectacular in the role of a possessed girl."
"Few movies shocked people like this one when it came out. Almost 35 years later, it will still shock you if you've never seen it. It's definitely recommended, but beware of some very gross scenes, brutal language and a sordid and genuinely frightening story. The special effects still hold up. They don't look dated and they are just as creepy. The story starts a bit slowly, but once in kicks in, it's tough to put this DVD on pause. This is still an intense, repulsive and scary movie filled with memorable scenes as a demon takes control over a young girl's body.Two things bothered me in the film that probably don't upset most people: way too much usage of the Lord's name in vain - almost all by the girl's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn. The second - and I am not Catholic - is the pitiful portrayal of yet-another Hollwood weak priest. This priest is smokes, drinks, swears, steals, etc.. etc, and is a pitiful excuse for a cleric: just the kind filmmakers love to portray. One priest - get this - says his idea of heaven is to be a nightclub performer for eternity and have everyone like him. Obviously, people who makes films have NO clue about ""religion."" Not a single clue. But, this was '70: the most irreverent film-making period in our history, so it's no surprise.However - to its credit - the film does an excellent job of convincing even the most ardent atheist that demons do exist, that there really is a devil, and that he is not to be taken lightly. It's no joke, and the shock value of this film might have gotten some people to start thinking there is something to all this ""spiritual stuff.""Whatever your theology, or lack of it, this movie is one you will never forget. It is beyond anything seen before it or since. I recommend the DVD that advertises this as ""The Exorist: The version you've never seen."" That's the best and most complete version of this terrifying film."
"I'll keep this brief - most every horror fan has seen The Exorcist and all of them have an opinion of it. While many people would most certainly list The Exorcist as THE scariest movie ever made, there seems to be a growing number of fans who find humor where it was not intended. I don't get it. Maybe it's a generational thing, but The Exorcist remains as effective today as it was in 1973. If the story of a young, helpless girl being turned into a snarling creature isn't horror enough, add to that the desecration of sacred religious symbols and you've got something quite shocking. Beyond the story, the strong performances by a good cast really help put The Exorcist over the top. Max von Sydow was never better. And the performance of an incredibly young and inexperienced Linda Blair is nothing short of remarkable. Add to that the excellent lighting, sound, cinematography, and special effects, and you've got not just a scary movie, but a very well made movie as well."
"Oddly, it's sometimes the repulsiveness of imagery that surpasses ""horror,"" becoming captivating in its revoltingness. This contrary advantage of primeval effect is the core of Friedkin's vision. Regan's thrashings are ugly, ferocious, but they've such effect on us since it's seen: Friedkin directs the viewpoint of these moments from the point-of-view of those seeing.And each setting's especially natural. This is also what made Jaws so exciting. No Transylvanian mansion with thunder, lightning. Throughout the whole scene between Burstyn and Cobb's detective, there's a deathlike silence. Just their voices, the sporadic tinkle of a cup. This amplifies our sensations. Burstyn's agitation becomes ours. Seconds after Cobb departs, Friedkin stuns the tautness with a piercing clatter and Regan's shouts. Burstyn dashes inside the room to terrified astonishment as books, papers, records, toys orbit hysterically.Visually plot items are realized with that contrary entertainment. Friedkin augments the authenticity of these scenes by not underscoring them. The dialogue, sounds, images bring the effect. And Friedkin knows how to develop to that dreadful pragmatism. Firstly, Regan says her bed shakes. We glimpse a black-and-white photograph of her, adding plain uneasiness to her pose. When she urinates on the floor at the party, the abnormality becomes visual. Seeing's believing.Friedkin intensifies each new shock, culminating in the masturbation, surely the most powerful moment due to the degree of debasement. We're constrained to watch, as Friedkin's wicked advantage is the lure of unspecified dread brought alive. Friedkin creates apprehension with his first image, black-and-white sunrise dissolving to an overwhelming orange. One practically feels the gleaming surges of heat. At the archaeological site, picks strike soil, sounds intensifying, shriller still when Von Sydow trembles finding the talisman.Apprehension becomes conflict. Von Sydow informs the keeper that he must leave. Then, he's almost run down by a black horse and carriage, a malevolent forewarning. Friedkin visually achieves a sensation that something horrific's impending. Von Sydow searches through the ruins, and faces Pazuzu's massive, menacing statue. Dogs fight ferociously, the effigy rigid versus the wailing winds while Von Sydow's bowed figure stands in bold resolve, action illuminating character.The feeling of dread and fear lives not just in the shadows but in broad daylight. Friedkin dissolves to barking neighborhood dogs in the damp gray over Georgetown, the bedroom of Burstyn, who hears bizarre scraping from her attic. Friedkin's taken us to a climax, a fearsome, unrestrained world, then deposits like a ride, gets underway again to the next climax. In illustrating the bizarre but accurate, the biological and cognitive potential justify the possession, also utilized to exciting, vile effect.As each medical option's reduced, the tension mounts as we see the possession intensify, causing Friedkin's attaining our surrender, agreement. Burstyn's sure Regan necessitates a priest. Burstyn's portrayed, basically, as an atheist, though her passion in this situation persuades us that she's certain her daughter's definitely possessed. The horrors begin in ordinary settings. Once we behold the cross masturbation, Friedkin's taken us from leg-pullers like attic scratchings to Regan's vicious, outlandish doings.Screams intensify tension, topping scenes emotionally. Friedkin employs sound as character. We're pacified fleetingly by silence, then the scream shocks. The distinction from tranquility to disorder in the dream sequence has the upshot of thrashing us instantaneously from relative comfort to a animal anxiety.Moreover, the handling of light contrasts is effective for its paradoxes. As in the dream, silver medal strikes black rock, cut to Regan in a vibrantly lit examination room, an icon of righteousness descending onto blackness, contrasted with Regan's hideous exploit in the barren luminosity. Familiarities such as tennis-playing students juxtaposed with Inspector consulting Miller about church defilements and McGowran's bizarre demise. Even in the daytime terror of the masturbation a gloomily shadowed image crowns the moment before the subsequent luster. Friedkin's most dazzling paradoxical disparity's in Von Sydow's re-emergence, a black outline in the lone gleam, wearing all black, invigorating the impression of wickedness Friedkin's founded, handsome visualizations assuming threatening connotations.The possession's cruelty is directly counter to Miller's vulnerability-become-power-via-selflessness. When he's introduced, he's visiting his mother in a dilapidated apartment. Her delight at seeing him is unadulterated, but he's swarming with self-reproach. He advises other priests but thinks he's losing his faith. When his mother dies, his remorse crushes. Nevertheless, despite private difficulty and misgiving, he does battle for a stranger. While he's not swayed it's a possession, Miller acquires the bishop's consent to do an exorcism. To Miller's disenchantment, Bishop thinks it best to have a man with practice: Von Sydow exorcized a demon years ago in Africa. Friedkin again expresses that Von Sydow and the demon are deep-rooted enemies, from their confrontation in the ruins to Regan's manifestation intensifying with Von Sydow's entrance.Friedkin advocates no principles, just illustrates the dismay defeated via fierce eradication. Nevertheless, it's the majestic shock of Miller's ultimate revelation and sacrifice that outdoes ""horror,"" becoming enlivening. It's all the power of a twilight sky observed through a nihilistic lens."
"In the documentary on the DVD, von Sydow says that if you are open to it, this film will scare you and perhaps affect you spiritually. Certainly true. Why this and not the many other similar films? Keep in mind that essentially all the rest of Friedkin's work is mundane, worthless.A large part of the question, I think, is that the creators of the film have stumbled into a rich field of archetypal conflicts, stuff deeper than just a sweet kid cursing and masturbating.The film is set in a Jesuit University. Even today, if you go there, you find a very strange vibe. The notion of authoritarian faith being crammed down from above certainly has a place in society, but such a brotherhood running an academy of open inquiry is a puzzling, disturbing mix. And that's underscored and mirrored by a similar (though less militant) conflict around psychiatry. Here we have the priests of `medicine' torturing this little girl to confirm their theories.The priest is the center of the film, and embodies all this: Arcane `faith' versus modern inquiry; Taking direction blindly rather than acting on knowledge; Understanding the mind versus understanding the soul; Serving the weak (his mother) versus battling powerful evil. Friedkin increased these ambiguities wherever he found them, usually against the positivist stance of Blatty.Interesting in this context are two tricks, one conscious, the other I suspect not.The conscious one is the self-referential wrapper. This is film about a film star, making a film. What triggers the possession are the visits by the director who probably had some deviant intent or action. He is the first victim. Thus, Friedkin places himself in the action and himself openly exploits Linda Blair. Meanwhile the actor playing the director dies in real life.The unconscious one is the Persian reference. Best scholarship has Judaism coming from Zoroastrianism flavored by Egyptian superficialities. A lower form of Zoroastrianism devolved into the much more widely adopted Mithraism, characterized by the warring of good and evil. This is sort of the professional wrestling of religious belief, both in style and substance, and continues today to be the root of `fundamentalism.' So in a very real way, Satan was invented in northern Iran, and any student of religion will end up `digging' around there.How sad and strange that this film seems to have bolstered the Catholic church."
"I saw 'The Exorcist' 32 years too late. This was not the kind of films to be allowed in the Communist Romania of my youth. It's really a milestone in the horror movies genre.I dare say that if 'Exorcist' was made today it won't go controversy-free. In the current moralistic climate, and with the on-going debates about the role of the Catholic church, a film about Catholic exorcism would generate some debate. The thing is that three decades passed and as we got used with this one, we can argue now about the 'Da Vinci Code'.The art of the movie is to take the very un-believable story of a pre-teen-age girl with a deteriorating mental health and make us believe that the only logical explanation is that she is possessed. We would not believe it in real life, we truly believe it on screen. The means to achieve this artistic truth are mostly classical cinema, good story telling and solid acting but at the same time the film is revolutionary by bringing to screen for the first time elements of the horror genre that have become routine since then - levitation, psycho-kinetic capabilities, and especially the make-up that transforms the angelic Linda Blair into a demonic kid-monster.Director William Friedkin had 'French Connection' in his record when he did 'The Exorcist'. This was to be his last great film, unless the future will bring us surprises - he is still working, now in his 70s. But these two movies are more than most directors do good in their whole lives, and well enough to book him a place in the history of the seventh art."
"This has to be one of the most well-known horror films, one of the highest-rated, and obviously a classic.""The Exorcist"" is exactly what the title implies. A demon has possessed a young girl in Georgetown, and two priests are set with the job of exorcising her after experiencing the horrifying proof of the demonic presence in the young girl, Ragen McMeil. (Linda Blair)This has got to be one of the most dramatic and saddening horror films that I've ever seen, and it's got to be one of the very best. In the religious area of horror style, it probably IS the very best, and is likely to be for years to come."
"William Friedkin has a reputation in Hollywood as one of its great directors of fast-paced ""chase movies."" ""The French Connection"" (1971), the controversial ""Cruising"" (1980), and ""To Live and Die in L.A."" (1985) come to mind. ""The Exorcist,"" his 1973 masterpiece of horror, is a chase movie in that regard, albeit a rather ""contained"" one, in that the ""chases"" all occur in one place, and don't involve cars, guns, or explosions.""The Exorcist"" has a reputation as the scariest movie of all time. I'm inclined to agree. I've never seen such horrific imagery from a movie in my life. Much of the ghastly imagery and scenery in ""The Exorcist"" still remains fresh in my mind. On top of that, I've never been so thoroughly unsettled by a horror film before. Before watching this movie, I knew (knew is italicized) that ""The Exorcist"" was the scariest movie of all time; I just needed to confirm it with my own eyes, and ears.The chase elements in this movie come into play in its second half, when Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) and Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) work together to save Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) from possession by the Devil, and to ""chase"" it back to Hell. Regan is the daughter of actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), who at first thinks her daughter is suffering from some sort of strange mental disorder, but is forced to face the horror herself in that fact that her daughter is possessed by unholy forces intent on dragging her kicking & screaming into the darkest depths of the demonic underworld.Based on the controversial novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty (who also wrote the screenplay), ""The Exorcist"" is THE horror film, and essential viewing for any true fan of the genre. Some will agree, some will disagree, but I don't think that lessens the film's impact. I've never been so thoroughly shocked by a motion picture before; all the warnings I've received beforehand proved out to be true. The film relies on realistic performances, Friedkin's precision direction, innovative and ground-breaking special effects, mood, horrific imagery, and disturbing bits & pieces of dialogue for its effects on the viewer (basically anything uttered by then-14-year-old Linda Blair while under the effects of demonic possession).I don't expect many of today's younger viewers to probably understand the significance of this picture, and its lasting effect on horror movie-making. They're too accustomed to gore and special effects. I should know, I'm one of them; I'm only 24, but I know powerful film-making when I see it. ""The Exorcist"" is the scariest horror movie I've ever seen. Don't believe me? Just watch it for yourself.10/10"
"Everyone has watched the exorcist at some point and its so well know that franchises like Scary Movie have ripped it off so well that its difficult not to raise a smile when scenes which were lampooned show up in the first few mins of the exorcist. Or so I thought.
It doesnt take long for the creeping dread of this movie to make you forget Scary Movie ever existed.
Theres no real need to explain the plot as its so well know.
Having watched this when I was much younger what I recalled were the possession scenes and the exorcism itself, however that isnt where the magic lies.
What stands out re-watching this as an adult was the sinister and creepy build up towards the exorcism.
What seems to be forgotten is that in this movie the possession is never really confirmed until the final third of the movie, a host of psychiatrist use the crude science available at the time in order to try and explain away the behaviour of the possessed girl. Watching the mother try to come to terms with whats happening and the ordeal the girl experiences at the hands of the medics is also harrowing.
The reason this is regarded as one of the best movies ever made are the human relationships and trials as an adult which are tested by the devil. Its aim is to drive a wedge between families and exploit the guilt families may feel towards each other. It is also authentic and was aided in production by the church who ensured it treated the matter seriously.
Sure some of the effects may look dated but its still effective. Or it was when I watched it this halloween in a freezing, dusty and decaying cinema. The environment certainly added to atmosphere of the movie.
I have heard reviews that some younger audiences have found this funny and cannot take it seriously, I doubt that will be the case when they grow up and watch this with the eyes of an adult. Its much more than one of the best horrors, its one of the best movies ever made. Period."
"There are certain scenes in ""The Exorcist"" that have a great power to them (the exorcism itself is a masterful set-piece) and others that are a bit shaky (including the drunk, unfunny director cracking Nazi jokes in the presence of a German butler); but overall, it is a film that mines genuine fear from a pervasive sense of vulnerability. In dealing with the possession of a young girl (Linda Blair) by an unseen, inexplicable force, we feel as if nothing is safe, therefore making the potential of horror that much greater. I suppose the story is probably the most familiar in the annals of horror at this point, but to recap: actress Chris MacNeil's (Ellen Burstyn) daughter, Regan (Blair) comes under the spell of a vile, vulgar demon (at one point implied to be the Devil itself), and when the most well-paid psychiatrists and doctors come up clueless, the Catholic ritual of exorcism is suggested. While the performances of Burstyn and Blair aren't revelatory (Chris often seems like an overly dramatic starlet in need of a Xanax, and Regan is confined to heavy make-up), the thread of plot dealing with Damien Karras (the Gabriel Byrne-ish Jason Miller), a priest who suffers the death of his mother and is afraid he's losing his faith, adds a believable, consequential depth to the tale--the visible doubt he conveys during the exorcism finale (alongside the brilliant Max von Sydow) makes the tension resonate on a higher level. ""The Exorcist"" is cerebral, plausible, and compelling...in my book, it may not be 'the scariest movie of all time,' but it unlocks an undeniably gripping fear."
"I took my Little Brother to see this movie when it was re-released in the theatres. We were both hoping to see an intense, psychological horror film. Instead, what we saw was a dull, tediously cloying film. The only way in which this film works at all is if you know beforehand that Linda Blair is possessed by the devil, otherwise, apart from the overbearing menacing soundtrack, there is almost no suspense. There's next to no explanation as to why Blair is possessed, I had no feeling of warmth for any of the characters, and it feels like the director didn't either. Its an intensely ugly movie and I felt cheated by it.I suppose that since it was one of the first movie's of this kind, then theatre-goers at the time viewed it very differently, but it really doesn't stand the test of time, and these days it seems like just an attempt by Hollywood to cash in on the commercial success of ""Rosemary's Baby."""
"Purists may enthuse about the lack of modern day special effects but what they fail to mention is that without these, The Exorcist captures all the excitement of an insurance seminar without an interlude.  To dispute with the purists, not all supernatural movies are spoilt with the dabbling of special effects.  With a premise not entirely different from The Exorcist, Poltergeist succeeded in enthralling an audience with the discerning use of ""garish"" effects and yet still managed to work up searing tension in the quieter moments.Not that any amount of editing would have brought this decaying carcass to life but the movie would have been better served missing the entire prologue, where we were treated to Max Von Sydow ambling along dusty passageways whilst looking horrified at finding some cheap bauble from a Christmas cracker.Without doubt, this so called masterpiece has surpassed all others in exploiting the ""event movie"".  It seems that by succeeding in getting a film withdrawn on it's initial release, in time it can become regarded as a classic - however underwhelming it may be. Simply by throwing in a few blasphemous expletives by a minor, this movie has been hailed as an icon of the horror genre.  Classic status should only be awarded to pictures which have stood the test of time.  Judging by the laughter from the audience at my screening, The Exorcist has not been able to sustain any fear factor 25 years later - if it ever did at all!  For those salivating over their first screening of this horror behemoth, prepare yourself for the fact that it plays about as frightening as an episode of Scooby Doo. In the case of The Exorcist (re-issue), the event is undoubtedly bigger than the movie.Please don't consider these views solely a ranting from an upstart of the MTV generation.  There are many horror movies made in the pre-Wes Craven era which have maintained classic status through the test of time and are still capable of terrifying today's audience - not just those who saw it way-back-then and still harbour fond memories.  With that in mind, special message to Gus van Sant:  You didn't need to waste your talents on a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho.  If you really wanted to challenge yourself, you could have concentrated on creating something resembling an effective chiller from this overhyped pap."
"Is the exorcist scary. Not very. Is it shocking Yes but so what anybody can shock you by having a little girl grab a psychiatrist in the private parts and then show a close up camera shot of the man's face as he writhes in agony. or doing unmentionable things with a crucifix or swearing about Jesus. Does it make any sense. Not really. Why would the devil enter the body of a little girl who is then strapped to a bed and has holy water thrown at her to torture her. If I was the devil I'd enter the body of someone with more power or the son/daughter of someone with power not the teenage girl of some old movie actress and I would hope that they'd make a better movie about my possession than this one. If someone's head rotated 360 degrees then they would be dead. It make for interesting shocking effect but it doesn't make any sense. Peasoup vomit. Please. I would give this movie 1 out of 10 and that only for it's shock value. Go see The b&w version of the Haunting if you want to be really scared. Even Damien is a more interesting well told story than this one. The only scary bit for me was when the priest listened to what Linda Blair was saying on the recording and it turned out to be in English but backwards. ""Dimmy why you do this to me"". And the first 10 minutes or so was about the most boring 10 minutes I've ever spent watching a video. The clock that stopped ticking for no reason was the only strange and interesting bit for the first 1/2 hour is this boring overrated overhyped movie."
The only movie I have ever ranked 10/10 on IMDb. Masterpiece!
"Everyone will have a different reaction to this movie. I thought it was very scary when I was young, but not as much anymore. I didn't feel like fainting or puking. I listened to the 40th Anniversary audio-book before watching the theatrical version.
All the actors did a great job of portraying their characters. The makeup of Regan and Father Merrin was very good. The sound effects and cinematography were great.
There were some minor flaws in the movie. During the exorcism scene, the statue of Pazuzu appeared when Regan was kneeling on the bed. That special effect was unnecessary because it's obvious she is possessed by that time. I think the conversations between Regan and Father Karras could've been longer as well. Other than that, the movie was very good. I give this movie a 9.8/10."
This is an incredibly disturbing film about a possessed child and an exorcism. Definitely beats modern remakes and very disturbing indeed
"By the time I was old enough to see 18 rated films. The Exorcist was not available on home video in Britain as the censors would not give it a certification.I eventually saw a special edition of the film and re-watched the original version more recently.William Friedkin has effectively made an art house horror film. It is leisurely paced and the exorcism part only plays a small part right at the end of the movie.The film begins at an archaeological dig in northern Iraq. Catholic priest Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) finds a representation of the devil.In Washington DC. Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is shooting her latest film. Her bright and normal 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) suddenly starts to display disturbing behaviour. Chris consults doctors and psychiatrists who cannot comprehend her increasingly erratic and bizarre behaviour. It includes mouthing obscenities or her bed violently shaking.When the drunken director of Chris's film dies by falling out of Regan's bedroom with his neck twisted, detective Kinderman (Lee J Cobb) investigates.In desperation, Chris consults Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller.) He is a young brooding Jesuit priest who studied psychology. He is also having a crisis of faith as he was not there for the death of his elderly Greek mother.Father Karras is shocked to see Regan's condition and believes she is possessed. The church puts him in touch with Father Merrin who has performed an exorcism before in Africa, something that almost killed him.Over 45 years later the antics of Regan now look less disturbing. I can imagine audiences would be shocked when the movie was first released. Even more bizarre was the furore that Linda Blair's demonic voice was dubbed. She was 14 years old during the making of the film, it looks obvious that the possessed voice is not hers.The film has a languid pace, it does seem an age before the exorcism takes place. When the exorcism takes place it is both potent and shocking. The performances from both Von Sydow and Miller is intense as they shout: 'The power of Christ compels you.'I found on second viewing that The Exorcist works better if you look at it as the story of Father Karras. His torment, his crisis of faith, his visions regarding his mother coming out of those subway steps. The movie benefits greatly in the special edition when both priests have a discussion as to why such a young girl was chosen by the devil to be possessed."
"The Exorcist is really something else. The editing is superb, especially when the daughters voice changes to the demon inside of her. Her convulsions on her bed also look perfectly unnatural, nobody just has a nightmare and does all that in their sleep. The style of dialogue used by the demon makes me laugh, but not in a comedic way. It is just so out of place, all these men of the cloth/ doctors surrounding a demon screaming obscenities. I found it amusing. The ""neck effect"" is also timeless, nobody who sees this movie forgets it. The makeup used to illustrate the demons possession was also awesome. My favorite part was the eyes, I couldn't look away. The exorcist is an absolute masterpiece, 10/10."
"Long thought of as one of the, if not the scariest film ever William Friedkin's The Exorcist is a scary excursion for two hours. The film's story is rather basic- a girl is possessed by the devil himself but filmmaking is so much more than the story. What works for the Exorcist is some haunting atmosphere, great make-up and fantastic acting especially by young Linda Blair. The theme is excellent and has become very popular and the pacing of the film is good- even though this is a long film."
A must watch for any die hard horror fan! The acting and music is superb!
"The main thing I really liked about this film was how different it was from many of today's horror films. It wasn't just your classic slaughter movie with the worst actors or just completely dumb characters who you almost want to route against, but instead was interesting with characters who actually had purpose in the movie other than to just be butchered. I would call this movie a horror but it may also be a drama as well. It takes a great look at what would actually happen if a young child were to become possessed in 1973, and I believe that's why so many people became so afraid of this movie or of the idea because of how realistically sounding this was. This movies impact reminds me a lot of like the movie JAWS. Once that movie came out and people heard if shark attacks being reported their was a mass hysteria which just added to the intensity of the movie and same with THE EXORCISM. The movie is one of the few horror movies where it actually has meaning and life to it instead of it just becoming a slaughter house halfway through."
"Okay, so this movie is a masterpiece. This is one of the best horror movies of all time, but its not the scariest movie of all time! It says that on the cover on all the physical copies, but thats not true at all. I can agree that it might was horrifying when it came out, and you went to see it, and had no idea what this movie was, but now its not so scary, except for a few scenes. Its more disturbing and mysterious, but i would still consider it a horror movie because of the darkness in the movie. The movie is about a 12 year old girl, called Reagan. She gets possessed by a demon called Pazuzu. In the start of the possession, they think it is the nerves and signs of puberty. But they are horribly wrong! A absolute must- see for horror fans, and one of the best movies of all time! Enjoy it!"
"There is a very frustrating scene from Jaws 2 where Brody walks into the selectsmen's meeting carrying the photograph that the two divers took as they were being eaten.  Brody sees the outline of the mouth and the eye. And he should know what a shark looks like.  But when he passes it around, Harry saysSeaweed?"" Verna Fields says, ""it's under water isn't it?  That's why it's so dark?""  They can't see something that is so obviously and that is bothersome.  That is how I feel about my reaction to the Exorcist. Everyone has told me how frightening it is and how it is a psychological trip.  And I know the reaction that audiences had towards it in the 70's. But as much as I try, I just can't see it.  It is not a scary movie and it is not even an enjoyable one, and I would even go so far as to say that it is not even a good movie.First off, there are so many parts of this film that have nothing to do with what the film is about.  The first hour is nothing.  It really has no relevance to the rest of the film.  And for the life of me I really can't understand what the beginning is about.  Why do we need the background of the Exorcist in Iraq?  What does that have to do with the film and how does it further the plot?  I don't get it.Secondly, this is a very poorly editted film.  There were times that I cringed at some of the editting.  It was such a blatant cut that you felt like you could see the editors crazy gluing the film together.  And I am not saying that to be cruel, I really mean that.Thirdly, and this is the big one, what is so scary about this film? Really, all Regan did was get her face scarred a bit, vomit a lot, yell out obsenities and blugeon herself with a cross.  Now that is interesting in the fact that this must have sent a shock wave through the religious community because you are not supposed to say or do anything bad towards the church. But in terms of scares or chills?  No way, they just weren't there.  I can admire a film like Halloween and Blair Witch for being innovative enough to scare us but no this film.  Frankly, I was bored.  I really was.  There were times that I wanted to turn this off and watch the baseball game, and we all know how boring baseball is on the tube.  But this film moved at a snails pace.  And if they would have cut it down by about thirty minutes, it may have been better.The other element that I can't get past is the fact that this was the devil himself.  Okay, let's just say it is.  Why does it allow himself to be tied down?  Why does it jump at water that isn't holy?  Why does it possess a girl when it can come onto this Earth in human form if it wanted to.  When Lucifer was kicked out of Heaven, he was abolished because of greed and a lust for power.  So for an angel to be that despised must have been considered dangerous and powerful.  If that is so, then why all the scenes of Satan being dominated by humans?  Are you saying that the best he could come up with is making a girl puke, levitate, and throw a few things around the room?  That sounds more like he was just having a bad day because he couldn't get his own way.  That doesn't sound like the personification of evil.  You want to see real evil, watch DeNiro in Angel Heart.The Exorcist is a film that has it's place in history and I can admire it for that.  And to be honest I almost feel like someone that doesn't like The Blair Witch Project.  I can't understand why people can't like that film, that is true fear for me.  So when I say that this film is really not that good, I can understand why people may think I'm ignorant, but when you compare this to A Nightmare On Elm Street or Halloween, can you honestly say that this has more to offer?  And if you can say that, well, I just don't see it."
"Having looked over the other user comments, I see there are some definite patterns in how people react to this movie. Religious people think it is horrifying, agnostic people think it is creepy, and atheist people think it is hilarious. But I really can't figure out the people who say it's scary because of its ""subtlety."" How on earth is vomiting, head twisting, levitation, and masturbation subtle? This movie is intended to shock and offend, not scare. I mean, a ""subtle"" possession movie would have the demon murmuring in a low, unearthly voice, not shrieking like the Incredible Hulk. Everything is just too over-the-top.There are parts that are pretty sick and twisted, but nothing really scary. It didn't take me long to figure out that this is nothing but shock schlock. I didn't find it as funny as some people do (although the pea soup vomit was rather amusing), but I did find it disappointing, insulting, and irritating.4/10 stars."
"How then to judge a film? That's a question I found myself asking after reluctantly deciding the Exorcist was worthy of a ""7"".I know of people that would downgrade works despite their aesthetic and artistic merit if they include, for example, violence. Though I feel in assessing a film or any other piece of art then one must judge it objectively. And so we get to the Exorcist. Well-acted, by Jason Miller and Linda Blair especially, it cannot be faulted in terms of direction. Though light and shade contrast beautifully in the Georgetown sequences, it is the cinematic vision of Iraq in the prologue that deserves special praise. On a technical basis, the film is not quite as good, particularly the scene where Blair has an obviously artificial stomach with ""help me"" written on it.This is a film that was banned for fifteen years in England until 1999. While I would stand against censorship and welcome the release of ""A Clockwork Orange"" next year (if only to discuss how good it is in this country without fear of being arrested) part of me wishes The Exorcist had stayed banned.Fans of the movie protest its psychological, and maybe it would have been if the director hadn't removed huge chunks of scenes between Regan and her mother at the beginning. (And what kind of mother would play a game of ouija board with her daughter?) It's supporters also protest that the film is religious, though again maybe this would be the case if a dialogue scene between the two priests hadn't been excised from the final cut. What remains is a depiction of the Devil that demonstrates it's wickedness by defiling a young girl. This is where the film  nicely shot and acted though it may be  falls down.I do not call a girl's head spinning 180 degrees, spitting pea soup or badly lip-synching to a demon's voice psychological. Creaking in the attic IS psychological. A cherubic young girl lousily miming to someone saying the ""f"" word is not. Take away the choreography and it's a schlock-horror film just like any other, but with fancy trimmings. Seeing a priest punch a girl three times in the face is not horror but gratuity. In order to show the evil, Regan (Blair) attempts to force her mother (Ellen Burstyn, Oscar-nominated but largely one-note) to perform oral sex on her. Before this happens we have Regan soaked in blood after masturbating with a crucifix. And there lies the crux of my argument. I don't like minors (Regan is identified as just 12 in the script) being placed into scenes with sexual content or connotation. Seeing a nude girl being scrubbed in a bath or having her top pulled down to be examined is content that would be used for titillation with a much older woman. Lastly we see Regan (actually a 22-year-old body double, but still presented on film as a 12 year old) inserting the metal object inside herself. Think about that for a moment. If you met someone who claimed to have seen a film where a minor is made to appear to be masturbating with metal object and conducting sexual relations with her own mother  faked or not  you'd have them arrested for indecency.Yet hype tells us we have to regard what really is just a tacky piece of filmmaking as classic modern cinema. The Exorcist  0/10."
"The Exorcist remains one of my all time favorite films, along with ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""The Godfather"", and ""The Sound of Music"". The Exorcist treats the whole idea of exorcism with respect, in my opinion. It does address the requirements of possession, according the to the rules of the Catholic church. I love the struggle of Father Karras, which is so common to so many people of faith; their logical mind, and what the eye can see, and the invisible world, which follows it's own rules. Karras is a scientist ( doctor ) and a very well-schooled one at that. I love how he thinks of himself as so lowly, so lacking in faith, when in fact he is shouldering such responsibility and the pain of others, and in the end of course, is completely redeemed, by giving his own life to save an innocent. However, it's hard for me to view the movie through the eyes of someone who has not read the book.The book is fantastic. You see what Father Merrin represents; complete spiritual superiority to so many of us. Yes he has his own little struggles, such as his huge intellect and therefore prejudice of small, trivial minds. And so, what does he do? Does he surround himself only with intellects, where he can freely share his knowledge in the rewarding game of idea exchange and professional validation? No, he puts himself among the most humble, poor and uneducated people he can find, in order to overcome a flaw which he acknowledges within himself. I'm talking about when he is working in Iraq. As Jesus taught, he gains spiritual growth through humility, not high positions and the material gain of this world. He is an awesome character. He beat the demon once before, and I love how he just wants to get to business, as soon as he arrives at Chris MacNeil's home. What time is there to waste? A little girl is dying. In the book, Chris finds safety and comfort, as she opens the door and sees his face, and I think the movie did a pretty good job of conveying that too.There is some essential dialog missing in the movie, which is in the book. It's during the brief break that the priests take from the exorcism, when Karras asks Merrin about the state of Regan's soul. ""There is no sin"" Merrin explains. He goes on to say that even though the demon has possessed Regan, and is a threat to her physical life, that the true victims are the ones watching this event, and the terror, anger, doubt and despair which the demon gives, is the demon's intent. The demon wants to hurt everybody, making them turn away from God, and of course Regan is simply his vessel. She, however is completely innocent. As a young Catholic, I was taught that baptism would prevent any demonic possession of that sort. I always felt very safe in that knowledge. ( ""Honey, Regan was not baptized"" ) However, now as an adult, I know that baptism does not prevent one from Willingly becoming a monster; simply look at the case of Himmler, Hitler's right hand man ( head of SS )to see that. That person was baptized, so that shoots that theory to heck and back.One thing that bothers me is when people say that the ""devil"" possessed Regan. No, it was a demon. Big difference. Any Catholic can tell you that there is a hierarchy here, with little demons working for their big guy ( Satan ) and Satan pretty much holding the same position in hell, as Archangel Michael holds in heaven. Keeper of the door, if you will. Satan is a fallen angel, made by God, not the ""opposite"" of God. If Satan has an opposite, it would be Michael. So it's not ""God versus the devil"". Just a little peeve of mine. Also, it's interesting how ( in the book ) Chris is still somewhat a committed atheist, in the end. She allows for evil spirits, and forces, being real. However, she still cannot acknowledge the existence of God, and the power of Christ. I always thought that was very interesting. If ANYONE would be converted, you would think it would have been her. And, in that way the story is so cool, because it just showcases the existence of religion and faith, and the enduring wisdom contained within, while the rest of the world goes on faithless, scientific, skeptical, and lost. Way to go, Exorcist!! Great movie, great score, cool message. two crosses up."
"The Exorcist (1973) was one of the greatest horror films ever made. It scared the nation and the people wanted more! The movie made a lot of money and it launched William Friedkin's career beyond the stratosphere (he was already a big name thanks to the French Connection). William Peter Blatty's novel was already a big seller when it was optioned for a silver screen adaptation. The conflicts between the two over how it would be presented as a film could make a movie by it's own right. There was as much action behind the scenes as there was in front of the camera.The story is about a priest who's at an ancient Sumerian archaeological excavation site. Father Merrin has been following the presence of an ancient evil deity named Pazul. He confronted it some time ago and is still haunted by it. At the same time, a young adolescent Georgetown resident is communicating with someone named Captain Howdy. Is their a connection? Meanwhile a middle aged priest is having disturbing dreams and doubts about his chosen profession of living a life of poverty as a priest. Are all these stories in some way connected? One must find out when watching The Exorcist!I am a fan of this classic. The behind the scenes tensions made this movie. The cast was excellent and William Friedkin was on the ball (Unlike most of his films after this one). The creepy ""Tubular Bells"" was an appropriate choice for the film's soundtrack. The Exorcist revived the career of Max Von Sydow and made a star out of Linda Blair. Watch it and you'll find out why it scared so many and stirred up a lot of emotions from the religious right and the moral majority. A true classic!Highly recommended!Like all successful films that came out of Hollywood, the Italians and a lot of lower tier American studios couldn't resist and cloned this movie to death. Some are good and others are pretty atrocious. The Italian film industry was saved by making knockoffs and parodies of this movie. I guess the so called ""spaghetti westerns"" were dead."
"Honestly, this was never a good film, it sucked in the 1970's when it was made, and it still sucks today when it is worshipped. How it ever passed for a good film is beyond me, but somehow millions of people still flock to screenings of this stinker while the Catholic Church continues to be outraged for some reason. The honest truth of this film is simple: it is not a great film, and it shouldn't be a controversial film. Its portrayal of the Church is if anything rational and progressive; ""What do you mean your little girl is possessed, what are you, stupid? This is the 20th century."" Face it people, the emperor is naked. There's barely anything passing itself off as a plot, just a series of sad, scary and sometimes silly scenarios that are largely unrelated to each other and a rather ridiculous premise when you actually examine it. Not to mention the lamest portrayal of a character in film history; that of the Devil. It is established that young and unfortunate little Regan is possessed not just by a demon, but (oooh insert scary music) the Devil himself . . . because she played with Ouija board . . . Right . . . Honestly, this is the best the Devil can do? His major forays into the world of mortals consist of puking green slime and making lewd remarks? When did the devil become little more than a drunken frat boy at a kegger? I mean sure when it's a little girl doing it, it's kind of odd, but throw a backwards hat on her and a baggy Lakers Jersey and she'd fit right in at the next Kappa Beta Gama pledge night. Why didn't he do something creative and take over the president and start a nuclear war, or take over a Georgia Prosecutor and then get her to leave law after a string of misconducts only to start her own lousy talk show? If I was Father Merrin I'd be relieved that this is the worst thing the Devil could come up with, pull up a chair next to the bed, throw on a Cheech and Chong movie and have some laughs, and then wonder if the reason Lucifer was actually cast out of heaven was for being obnoxious and lighting his own farts while everyone was trying to watch UFC.Meanwhile all of the other supporting characters have an emotional range that spans the vast gulf of human expression ranging from ""concerned"" to ""disturbed"", oh there's a few party scenes but those get spoiled too and everyone goes back to ""concerned"". There's a sort of half-assed side plot involving a priest losing his faith because his mother dies, a half assed side plot involving a movie actress, and another of a sort of wandering exorcist priest wandering through poor countries looking to cast out demons (apparently demons don't hang around in country clubs or boardrooms, but only in those Sally Struthers countries). The widest range of emotions come from Regan/Satan who goes from looking uncomfortable while being probed by doctors to grinning like an idiot while she grosses everyone out with her cooky demonic antics.If you're going to watch this film for the first time, watch it objectively. Ask yourself what exactly is scary about the premise for this movie. Ask yourself why the devil couldn't come up with anything better than freaking some people out and making a big mess of a little girl's room. Then after you've done this, go and pick up a copy of the only good Friedken movie: The French Connection."
"The Exorcist has often been called the greatest horror movie ever made, and for a good reason. It was revolutionary during its release and the passage of decades has not dulled its impact in the slightest. It's still an uneasy film in the best possible meaning of the word, tapping into several sources of fear simultaneously, while still telling a coherent, captivating story. You get the creepy atmosphere right from the start as we follow an old priest in the desert and find out with him that something wrong has slipped through the cracks into the world of man. Something old and ancient, something that does not belong.But we've seen many creepy films since then and if that was all the movie had, if it was all promise and no payout, it wouldn't have earned its reputation. Luckily, the film is more rounded than that. Many ""horror"" movies nowadays rely on jump scares, easy wrights that momentarily spike our adrenaline levels without scaring the mind. It's physical, instinctive and ultimately leaves no impact. This movie and other films like it, however, do utilize shock value as a mean to create horror, but the imagery they use goes deeper than something that merely looks scary or unsettling. The sight of Regan (Linda Blair) being slowly corrupted by a demon is jarring on an emotional level. It touches the nurturing side within us. It's wrong, it's taboo and because of that it's something we will remember, something we automatically oppose. It's adult fear, to use the technical term, something quite different from being afraid of the monster under the bed.Furthermore, it's a film that shines in execution as well. All the actors do a magnificent job of portraying ordinary people that have to face the unthinkable, the impossible. The movie doesn't shy away from reality in order to make the story seem more plausible. Rather it freely acknowledges the implausibility of the situation, contradictorily making it a more believable film. Add in brilliant sound design, masterful use of music to create atmosphere, stunningly effective practical effects and great lighting and you have a film that quite effortlessly convinces you that yes, a small girl can become possessed, easily in fact.I don't think it's out of line to say you're not a true fan of horror before you've seen this film. It does so many things right and gets so little wrong that it's no wonder people still flock into theaters to see reruns of it, that people still talk about it, discuss it, lose sleep over it. Greatest horror movie of all time? Quite possibly. At the very least it's right up there at the top."
"The Exorcist (1973, Dir. William Friedkin) Something beyond evil is happening in a little girl's room. Regan (Blair) has brutally changed both in the way she looks and the way she acts, with violent outbursts on everyone who comes in contact with her. Her worried mother (Burstyn) gets in contact with a priest (Miller) who comes to the conclusion that Regan is possessed. The top priest who can deal with an exorcism, Father Merrin (Sydow) is called in to help save Regan from the demon inside her.Although the scare factor it once had has decreased since then, this freaky and bizarre horror uses all the successful horror conventions to make a successful horror film. The effects are brilliant and the acting is so realistic. This is a pure horror classic.Mother? What's wrong with me?  Regan (Linda Blair) It's just like the doctor said. It's nerves, and that's all. You just take your pills and you'll be fine, really. Okay?  Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn)"
"I can't praise this movie enough. I am proud and lucky to have watched this movie on theaters. I watched it on it's re-release back in 1999 with the ""new"" scenes. The experience was amazing. I mean, watching the scariest and most popular mainstream Horror movie of all time is something that has no price.""The Exorcist"" deserves it's almost heavenly status (no pun intended) because it's truly a movie that deals with one of the most scary and prohibited topics in modern civilizations; that is, The Devil.The story is simple but effective on every aspect. A young girl has been playing with an Ouija board and soon after strange things start to happen to her normal life and her surrounding. Her house is being attacked in lower portions by demonic spirits, for example. It's until her physical form is completely possessed by Pazzuzu, who is the ancient demon that takes physical form of insects. Pazzuzu, according to the history of humanity, has only been able to possess a few persons. Reagan McNeill is one of them. Her mother hires the best doctors, psychiatrists, scientific that money can buy but none of them can give a solution to Reagan's condition. That is until a priest takes on the case and recommends an exorcism. The roman ritual is applied to Reagan and the demon Pazzuzu finally leaves Reagan in the name of God.But the story is more complex than that. We, as the audience, are taken into another level of faith and beliefs towards The Devil and God. The story also deals with clinical terms and methods. So it's up to you to believe if Reagan was actually possessed or had a sickness. Of course, the director does the necessary to make you believe that truly a demon possessed the young girl. Also, Father Karras who is an active part in the exorcism has issues with his faith for God and is truly a tormented soul for some events displayed in the movie. On the other hand, Father Merrin who is a veteran of exorcisms and once defeated The Devil has his faith at top level and manages to command the ritual. But the complexity of the story does not ends there. There are many references to Reagan's possible possession. It's mentioned that her family is Altheist and do not believe completely in God. We can assure that when Chris McNeill gets really angered when the Austrian home worker puts a crucifix under Reagan's pillow. Also, some strange events make the audience wonder if actually The Devil had something to do for example, with Burke's death.My advice is : be objective with this movie because it will intrigue you, it will make you think, and if you give permission to it, ; it will scare the hell out of you. It has nothing to do if you believe in God or not; the visual experience is powerful and with the aid of a clever script you will experience something that no other movie can deliver. That is, justified fear.The production values of this movie are excellent, impressive. The acting is top notch. This movie carried Academy Award nominations for Elen Burstyn in a powerful, dramatic performance as the mother who tried everything in order to cure her daughter. Her performance is impressive and truly demonstrates her acting skills because acting this character is sui generis. Jason Miller also delivers a powerful, sentimental performance. First, he cries the death of his mother and then he recovers his faith and faces The Devil in the roman ritual. A performance like none other. Max Von Sydow has little on screen time but delivers a solid, believable performance as the elder Exorcist who fights Pazzuzu for second and last time. Linda Blair will always be remembered for this role. Her performance is also impressive. Lee J. Cobb delivers a delightful performance as the clever witted detective who follows the murder of Burke and little by little gets intrigued by the demonic connections.Please, watch this movie if you haven't or watch it again if you didn't like it. It has a lot to offer and truly has proved through time that it's one of the most influential and powerful movies of all time.""The Exorcist"" is more than a Drama Horror feature. It's almost a religious experience if you watch it with enough seriousness.Some memorable scenes: Father Merrin's first encounter with the statue of Pazzuzu, Father Merrin's last battle against Pazzuzu, Pazzuzu making an appearance in the final exorcism; the statue is truly frightening in that scene, the infamous crucifix masturbation, the head spinning 180ª, the dialogs between Karras and Pazzuzu, the bed that gets elevated, Father Merrin's demise, Karras' possession, the nightmare sequences, etc.God bless this movie."
"Alright, let's just be boring and say that The Exorcist is still f***ing chilling to the bone. Shots that William Friedkin designed from paintings (like the shot of Max von Sydow's Father coming to the house in silhouette and seeing the lone light beaming out from the bedroom window), and taking from some ""based on a true story"" stuff from writer William Peter Blatty that the director shoots like a documentary is what sells it for me, for us, for the world. It could be said, argued, that after years of parodies like in the 'Scary Movie' movies that the effect of seeing a little girl spewing green puke and rancid curses in the voice or 70 year old chain smoker Mercedes McCambridge isn't scary as it used to be.But the (surprising) fun of the Exorcist, and the dread, is that Friedkin doesn't back down from taking this seriously, and with an intensity that is unshakable. The acting is so naturalistic, yet still the actors giving screen performances (and it's people like Ellen Burstyn and von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb, you can't go wrong there), and there is a bit of mythology too – in maybe the only slightly over-long sequence at the beginning where the older Father goes about old ruins in Iraq to find spooky things as they say, the devil's in the details. And this is still the film to beat when it comes to stories of demonic possession, by far."
"Exactly what the subject says.This film truly has a way to frighten you, regardless if you are a person of faith or not.There will never be another film like this.If you have not seen this, please - watch, pay attention and enjoy."
"Every little thing about this movie seems to have had a purpose, creating the perfect mood. Even just the first scene with the boy running is perfectly crafted. The way that the camera follows him and switches angles gives the audience a nervous feeling to dive into the movie with. The beginning of the movie is incredibly well-done in terms of sound as well. The diegetic commotion surrounding Father Merrin followed by almost complete silence until the non-diegetic, intense music is played when he faces the demon statue works very well to create an uneasy feel. The play with sound to create a mood is apparent throughout the film, especially with Regan's different, haunted voices and noises. It is not just sound that makes this movie extraordinary. The cinematography and editing are incredible. As the audience, we experience everything from excellent moving close up shots like in the subway with Father Damien walking to incredible, very quick editing to create a creepy feel to Father Damien's dream. The lighting throughout the film is also impressive and gets progressively darker following Regan's psychological state. Of course, the exorcism scenes themselves are also very well-done, combining all of the aspects previously discussed to create a terribly intense, horrific feel. I appreciated how this film actually followed a story unlike many horror movies today that really just feature jump scares. We are immersed in Regan's life as she battles what is inside her, and we become invested in the well-being of the characters we see. As a horror movie lover, this movie leaves me wanting to watch it again and again, appreciating the incredible artwork that made it the haunted film it is."
"What can be said about this unsurpassed horror masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Perhaps the fact that it is so grounded in realism makes it the perennial kind of its genre. Some may look to the themes it so masterfully explores whether it be religion, faith, humanity, philosophy or ethics that puts it on a pedestal by itself. The spine-tingling score, one of the most memorable villains of all-time, the ominous pacing of the film - all reasons that separate this film as one of the single greatest horror films ever made.As for the performances? They are all superb and each are vitally important to the film, since so much of it is the build-up of plot, characters and setting. In fact, the titular event doesn't even occur until much later than one would think. And this is because we have a director in William Friedkin who trusts his audience to be patient in understanding the ambiguity (a little paradoxical) of the subject matter at hand. As one doctor after another continues to feed BS diagnoses to Chris MacNeil, Friedkin forces us to confront our biggest fear: the unknown. Author Andrew Smith once wrote: ""People fear what they don't understand and hate what they can't conquer."" Linda Blair as Regan MacNeil delivers one of the most chilling performances of all-time, transforming from a sweet, innocent and cheerful little girl to the definition of evil incarnate. The images of her slowly degrading condition have that raw power to stay so firmly entrenched in your mind. Ellen Burstyn as Chris MacNeil tragically conveys a mother clinging to whatever hope she has left in saving her doomed daughter. Max von Sydow and Jason Miller also give memorably powerful performances as the two Fathers, Lee J. Cobb is superb as Lt. Kinderman - to single out just one person out of this superb ensemble performance would be fatal, every individual in this film is superb!With images that have that rare power to subside and remain in your memory, The Exorcist is that special film that succeeds in being so realistic with subject matter that can be considered far from. The only other perfect horror film I can recall seeing (at least in my humble opinion) is Psycho. And though you can't compare apples and oranges, the images, music and deeper themes portrayed from both somehow manage to just stay with you; there's no other way to really put it. The Exorcist transcends the horror genre and becomes an experience, with images of beauty and terror that can never be forgotten. A deserved title of being deemed a 'classic'."
"This movie defines the meaning of being possessed, where teenage girl Regan (Linda Blair) is being controlled by a mysterious supernatural being. As a result, her mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) desperately seeks the help of two priests to save her daughter.This is an iconic and great piece of horror cinema with a lot of tension and thrills, from Regan acting bizarre and displaying out-of-character behavior to her being fully controlled by the demon, while her mother watches helplessly. The scenes where the priests, in a fit of frenzy and determination, try to save the uncontrollable Regan from the unholy creature will give you a frightening, yet edge-of-your-seat excitement.Filled with great acting, spectacular make-up, and a good dose of horror mixed in with tense, spiritual drama, this is a must-see for any horror movie fans.Grade B+"
"""Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good. You tell me that!""Definitely one of the most well-crafted horror movies that I've seen. Lots of time is given to developing the characters and atmosphere, which leads to a pretty fantastic payoff in the end. There's a clear sense of expert care taken with every aspect of the movie; there are no slapdash efforts or cut corners, from the script to the acting to the music. This story of young girl who may be possessed by a demonic entity is full of shocking imagery, but never once feels exploitative. The themes of doubt, faith, and sacrifice are clear, but not the least bit heavy-handed. The practical special effects are still impressive today, so I can only imagine the impact they had back in 1973. Frightening, disturbing, and ultimately, even a bit uplifting. The Exorcist is one of those classic movies that's still just as good today, and that every horror buff should see. "
"Adapted from the 1971 novel of the same name by William Peter Blatty and based on the exorcism case of Robbie Mannheim, 'The Exorcist ' is a terrific film, that is eerie, thought-provoking & challenging! 'The Exorcist' is about a young girl dealing with the demonic possession and her mother's desperate attempts to win back her daughter through an exorcism conducted by two priests respectively.William Friedkin is a proficient storyteller, and his body of work proves that. 'The Exorcist' is his finest attempt as a storyteller and observer. More than being a horror cult-favorite, it's a film that questions our beliefs and disbelief's. It has an outstanding start, middle & end.Linda Blair's portrayal as a possessed soul, is exemplary. A legendary performance that not only haunts you, but also makes you empathize the person suffering within. Ellen Burstyn is superb as the desperate/shattered mother. Jason Miller is fabulous in his part.On the whole, This Truly is Hallmark Cinema! An Outstanding Cinematic Achievement! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"This horror film about a girl possessed by the devil became a box office blockbuster. The acting is pretty good and Friedkin creates a chilling atmosphere. However, the story is quite silly. It is not so much a horror film as an exercise in gross effects, with pea soup playing a prominent role. In fact, some of Blair's antics are more comical than scary. The expository scenes are not very interesting, and the prologue in Iraq, while well filmed, does not fit in with the rest of the film. The plot has some holes, and even if one accepts the premise of possession, there is no logic to someone turning her head 360 degrees without dying. It's simply cheap thrills."
