"Perfect Blue is a very strange film.  It's anime, but it's set in circa-1995 modern Tokyo, with a story in which everything could be explained in terms of natural phenomena and present-day technology.  Furthermore, it's a psychological thriller, a genre which probably hasn't ever been done with animation before.  But even if Japan's animators dabbled in this genre more often, Perfect Blue would still be a bizarre film.  It starts off as a fairly conventional thriller about a teen pop singer who may be the target of a stalker, but then the movie goes completely insane, assaulting the viewer with rapid changes of scene, perspective, and context until we simply don't know what to believe anymore.  This is done so subtly and gradually that we become completely trapped in the movie's spell, and we end up just staring at the screen in horror, helpless to stop the nightmarish events from unfolding. Rarely has any movie so effectively conveyed the lunatic terror of a character who has lost touch with reality, and once the movie is over, all you can do is just sit there and try to figure everything out.  Have fun with it.  It's a good head scratch.Unfortunately, the last minute or so of the movie is much too sappy and uplifting (especially the music on the end credits), cheapening the significance of everything that has gone before.  But as a whole, Perfect Blue is an incredibly haunting thriller, a scathing look at the world of showbusiness, and a very worthwhile film."
"OK, this is definitely one anime movie that really has this creepy feel that clings to you as you watch.  The animation is really good as characters and movements appear so life-like, it seems like reality.  There's definitely the theme of 'identity' and Mima's difficulty distinguishing reality from illusion.  Her paranoia and fear tends to grab your attention and as she asks questions, you ask the same ones.  I thought the film also played well with celebrity infatuation and the price of fame.  It really had a lot going for it and the different camera angles give a very dreamy, mysterious atmosphere.  One great shot is the zoom out from Mima's apartment. I could've sworn that was a real city.  ""Who are you?"" sums up this movie.  What a film.  By the way, CHAM's song is really catchy."
"Perfect Blue takes many levels of reality, fiction, dream, and delusion, and merges them into an occasionally baffling but overall thrilling and satisfying film.Mima is a rising pop star, not yet in the big time, but certainly on the way.  She and her management team decide that it is time for her to try something new, so she leaves her pop group to become an actress, and that is when the problems start.Is there another Mima out there?  She is ghost-like, still a pop star, denying this new acting career, ever-smiling... but if she is real, she may be a brutal killer.  What of the stalker with the creepy face and violent temper?  Is he the one running the website which describes Mima's daily routine in obsessively minute detail?  If so, how does he know all these things?Madness and nightmares blend with the scripts of the increasingly bizarre role Mima plays in her debut acting job.  Days repeat, life imitates script, and script imitates life.  Are the boundaries between reality and dreams breaking down? ...and who is killing those who Mima is closest to?Perfect Blue will probably confuse you, and the ending will leave you thinking, but in these days of neat, clean-edged storytelling, a little confusion is good for the soul.I highly recommend this to fans of thrillers and anime alike, plus it is a great introduction to the world of Japanese animation for those just getting their toes wet.  There are no giant robots or sex-crazed demons here, just a tight, clever psychological thriller with one hell of an ending.Make sure you see it with Japanese dialogue and English subtitles.  That done, turn off the lights and prepare to be entertained."
"Sooooooo many films have been ripping this movie off all this time and I didn't even know about it. Wow. Just wow. You need to go into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. I was just told to check this out because I love trippy types of films that f with your headspace. It is about a pop singer who is transitioning into becoming an actress and crazy sh#t begins to happen. At first I felt like a pervert watching this because you're basically watching a girl run around in a short skirt for two hours but after the crazy stuff starts kicking in and you're required to start figuring stuff out, you'll see there is a method to ever inch of this movie. If anyone can message me and tell me if that is the real her at the end, I would much appreciate it. I swear that isn't her but I just don't know. I'll have to watch it again. They need to make a live action version of this before anymore films rip it off (Black Swan, I'm looking at you)"
"'Perfect Blue' is the most interesting animated movie I've ever seen. Lovers of cinematic puzzlers from 'Vertigo' to 'Abre los ojos' or the movies of Dario Argento or David Lynch will probably enjoy this one more than your typical anime fan, who might find this too slow, and not flashy enough for their tastes. I don't think 'Perfect Blue' quite reaches the heights of the aforementioned, but it is still a fascinating, multi-layered thriller that improves with repeated viewings. As a look at the illusions of fame and the dark side of obsession I personally found it to be a much more satisfying movie than the more celebrated and flamboyant 'Mulholland Dr.' I strongly suggest that the original Japanese subtitled version is watched rather than the inferior English dubbed one for maximum effect. This is one movie experience that will stay with you for days. Highly recommended."
"Perfect Blue is a storming success in every department. As a movie in itself, it's a brilliant piece of work, packed with style and -very- powerful scares. We follow teen pop idol Mima, who tries to make the switch from singing to TV acting. Everything seems normal enough at first, with just the somewhat funky directing hinting at things to come. But it wouldn't be a thriller if good ol' normality didn't come crashing to pieces to make way for some terrifying madness and violence. Things start to go pear-shaped when the studio staff working around Mima are threatened, and later horribly killed, apparently by an obsessed Mima-fan who doesn't like the new direction her career is taking. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Mima herself is starting to go bonkers with all the pressure. She begins to have visions of a disturbing alter ego, more or less her ""old self"" from her singing days. And this ""other"" Mima doesn't want to play second fiddle to the new acting image Mima has taken on; she claims to be the real one, with the flesh-and-blood Mima being the fake. Mima's delirium grows gradually more entangled, until she sinks into a mental state where it's impossible for her, and for the audience to tell what is, and what is not really happening. And there are still those murders going on...Granted, the ""movie within a movie"" gimmick has been done before so often that it doesn't even strike me anymore as original. Reality-twisting is also something I've seen before. All the same, Perfect Blue managed to impress me enormously, and scare my socks off like no other film. There's something about not knowing for sure (as a viewer) what is and isn't for real that always keeps one intrigued. Particularly during the more violent moments (and the film does get seriously nasty), one is constantly praying that it's -not- for real. ""Go on, snap out of it, Mima. This is too scary to be real, you're just having another vision...right? Right?"" The leitmotiv of a second self also intrigues me, and I found it delightful trying to pick out which Mima was really the ""real"" one. Just how strong is ""false"" Mima's presence in reality? Is she a complete phantom of the imagination, or does she have a litteral, physical presence of some kind? And most of all; out of these two versions of herself, which one does Mima really want to be? If you can't tell for sure what does and doesn't really happen, you also might not take everything the characters declare for granted. The ending does provide a somewhat logical explanation that ties up all of the insanity again, but that doesn't mean the fun of figuring this out for yourself is completely spoiled; you can very well not take the ending entirely for granted either (while it makes sense, there are some bits about the explanation it provides that don't completely gel with me). Lots of re-watchings and picking apart of hints is in store for me there. Love it when that happens ^^.A few tiny niggles; the animation quality in the first half of the film is not quite breathtaking, and seemed decidedly below-par for movie quality animation. Luckily, it picks up later on, becoming pleasingly smooth. And by the time you reach the terror of the later part of the film, you're already too frightened to really be picky about animation quality. Some of the violent and/or explicit scenes are very nasty indeed (ewww, straight people, sick man), but they serve the purpose of enhancing the fright factor very well, rather than just being needless grotesqueries to please the gore-junkies in the style of that hideous Akira. The film is a complete success as a frightening, surreal and involving thriller (though I do still like Jinn-Roh much better).But another reason to rejoice is that Perfect Blue is a step in the right direction for the general public's image of what anime really is. Sure, the enlightened few among us for whom Evangelion is standard fare, and who can give detailed insights into the latest CLAMP titles already know that anime is not ""a genre"". It's a medium in itself, and the Japanese animation market can, and does treat every imaginable genre and subject, often with skill that leaves feeble Hollywoodian efforts miles behind itself (in the case of Perfect Blue, it speaks volumes that a celluloid character such as Mima manages to become more lifelike and sympathetic than any sillicone tarts Hollywood chucks around the screen). It's hardly uncommon to see a genre such as a psychological stalker-thriller treated in animation to the Japanese. Heck, they've done every other imaginable thing under the sun in animation, and a damn good job they do at it as well. It's just a shame that hardly any of the really good stuff ever makes it over to the West, thus creating a distorted image for casual western viewers. We do seem to have made some progress from the Akira Aftertaste years, where anime was generally put on the same line as sex and violence and very little else (side-step; how come nobody ever raises a finger when live Yank actors engage in orgies of the most brutal porn and bloodshed in just about every Hollywood flick ever made, but the whole world screams bloody murder when an anime character so much as takes his socks off? Live Yanks can get away with everything?). Now it's ""anime is just pink-haired fairies in giant explosive turbo robots"". They're getting just a tiny bit warmer, but maybe Perfect Blue will get the message across to a few others that anime embraces a diversity that ranges from Sailor Moon to Wings of Honneamise (and I'm just globally sketching here), with a reasonably large number of people getting to actually see this. A quite decent English dub that doesn't hamper the film too much is also a plus, though a dub will of course never equal the original. It might help to keep the above paragraph in mind for a Perfect Blue viewer not initiated to the big picture of anime. In any case, it's an impressive movie for anyone, worth seeing for being so unique, gripping and masterfully scary. I'll think twice before I look into a mirror for a long time to come after this...A final note about the notorious comment that this could be a Disney-Hitchcock hybrid. Hitch perhaps, but comparing this kind of quality to Disney's paper-flat commercial slop is simply an insult to Perfect Blue."
"Japanese animation has become a very popular style of animation in Western culture due to the wide range of genres it employs and its many different approaches to storytelling; two elements that immediately set it apart from the common Western style of cartoons that almost always are made for children only. Satoshi Kon's ""Perfect Blue"" quickly became a favorite among western fans of anime because it explored themes rarely seen in western animation; themes that had more in common with the horror genre such as obsessions, murders and suspense.The story revolves around Mima (Junko Iwao), a young singer who is quickly becoming an idol as part of the musical trio ""Cham"". In order to make her career more marketable her managers make her leave the group and join the cast of a famous TV series. However, her new role is considerable different than the cute image she portrayed in ""Cham"", as it requires her to do nude scenes including a rape scene. At the same time she tries to adjust to her new job, someone begins to stalk her and to brutally kill those near her artistic career and Mima begins to wonder if she is really doing the right thing.""Perfect Blue"" is often labeled as a classic of Japanese animation because it presents a way different kind of story to those used to family-oriented animation. In is closer to an Italian Giallo than to a normal cartoon both in thematics and in style. The use of animation as a medium allows director Satoshi Kon to create stylish images of high surrealism as well as powerful images of violence. It is not something young children should watch.Based on a novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, the film offers an interesting and harsh criticism to the ""idol culture"" in Japan, and its exaggerated portrait of an obsessed fan is an extreme, yet hauntingly realist image of insane obsessions. The story has been labeled as ""Hitchcocknian"", but its lack of subtlety in terms of graphic violence and nudity, as well as its high level of surrealism puts it closer to the stylish Italian sub-genre of Giallo.By keeping the story around Mima, Satoshi Kon creates haunting atmospheres of paranoia as Mima feels strange in her new career; while it sacrifices character development of the supporting characters, this approach increases the feeling of isolation and adaptation the story has, making a more effective horror/mystery piece. Like any Giallo, the haunting image of the mysterious stalker is always present, and in ""Perfect Blue"" the mystery and suspense are very well handled making the movie a great work of suspense.The animation is very good, and not as flashy as casual anime fans would assume. The movie's mixture of realism and surrealism works very well with the style of drawing and the camera-work is brilliant. Still, while the plot at times gets a bit predictable to hardcore horror fans, it still holds up and keeps captivating from start to end. The original Japanese voice work is very good, so I would recommend watching it with subtitles instead of dubbed.""Perfect Blue"" seems flawless as motion pictures can go, and the odd choice of using animation as medium (it was originally meant to be a normal live action movie) makes it different than the rest. This is a blessing as neither anime fans nor horror fans have seen a quality animated horror movie like this before. 8/10"
"Based on Yoshikazu Tekeuchi's novel of the same name, ""Perfect Blue"" is a Japanese anime film that tells the story of Mima Kirigoe, a pop idol who decides to leave her musical group while it is still at the top of the charts and concentrate on acting. Unfortunately, this transition does not sit well with one of her fans because an obsessive person who seems to be pervasive in her life soon stalks her. Even when she comes across the fan's website, she finds that the blog entries are not only written to make it seem like they are her thoughts, but they actually ARE her inner-most thoughts. What starts out as a moderately scary obsession quickly becomes a terrifying struggle to both deal with her inner demons and eventually, save her own life.I once heard ""Perfect Blue"" described as ""Hitchcock does anime"", which is a dead-on descriptor for this film. The character designs were slick, the music was good (mostly techno) but the story is fantastic. I honestly was still trying to guess who the stalker was until the end of the film, and the reveal does not disappoint. There are some graphic moments (one is a rape scene on the set of the film she is making) so it does not fall into the stereotypical ""it's a cartoon so it must be okay for kids"" label that the non-anime viewing public seems assume.I highly recommend this film, particularly to people who are not very well versed in anime  it would be a really good way to get your feet wet in the genre. There were many times during the film where I actually forgot I was watching animation, the action and story are so all consuming. Perfect Blue gets a strong 7/10 from me.--Shel"
"On the cover of this film, Roger Corman is quoted as saying ""If Alfred Hitchcock partnered with Walt Disney they'd make a picture like this."" He couldn't be more right.The story is about a pop idol Mima, who is sheding her squeaky-clean image for that of an actress. Along the way, she is raped onscreen for a sleazy television show, and does a nude shoot for a men's magazine. This makes her dirty, as her old self tells her. She finds a web site detailing every intimate little detail in her life, and believes that she is being stalked by a strange man. Her personality splits in two, into herself and her old, clean, self which tries to murder her. While she is battling her old self, all of those who contributed to her downfall are being grusomely murdered.
This movie has been critisized by others on this very site, saying that the film was boring in the first 40 minutes. How wrong they are. In Hitchcock's films, (take Psycho for example) he builds up character for the first half-hour until the slashing. This does the same, because if we were not built up to believe that Mima's character is not real-i.e 3-dimensional, then we would feel no sense of loss and disorientation when all hell breaks loose in Mima's life (and the editing room).A first class film with twists all the way. Should be seen by any movie fan with a mature mind. Even though it will probably collect dust in the anime section of the video store.5/5 Only beaten in the anime stakes by Ghost in the Shell (2nd) and Akira (1st). Pure genius."
"Mima Kirigoes is part of a young idol group Cham, but she decides to move on and kick-start a career as an actress with some help by her pressuring agent. To change her image, she accepts some confronting roles, which eventuates into her downward spiral between realities and virtual. She discovers an Internet site that knows her every move and those responsible for growing success in the acting industry end up brutally killed.Well, what can I say? Simply, I forgot that I originally saw this wonderfully, stunning anime picture before. I don't know how it left my mind, because it's very chilling and effective across the board. Based on Yoshikazu Takeuchi's novel, ""Perfect Blue"" is an intoxicatedly, shocking psychological thriller that does resemble some works of Lynch, Polanski, De Palma and rightly so, Hitchcock. Even a giallo imprint shines heavily within the mixture.The mature plot boldly plays it cards at a mild pace and eventually forms a structure like a rubrics cube. I wouldn't go out of my way to call it complicated, but there's stylish imagination and cerebral details that gladly doesn't fall into a convoluted mess. The characters' persona's are well defined and emotionally attachable. It can turn into an uncomfortable ride, where dazzling images of fact and fiction skews into one. You can't help but get those disorientating spells that the distraught Mima succumbs to on her journey to find her feet as an mature entertainer. Where her dreams become her anxiety, as she's too sensitive to how she's being perceived then being her true self. Her clean-cut image becomes tainted and a growing obsession towards her takes its tole on her fractured and vulnerable mind.Paranoia, delusions and a dreamlike air are cooked up with an array of tension and creepy visuals. The animation isn't a visual goldmine, but its showered with powerfully focused and flashed up images that manage to keep the viewer at bay. The pressure building dialogues are quite biting, and the revealing twist catches you off guard because of the superb use of artificial dreams with its fast editing and exhilaratingly moody soundtrack.You don't have to be a fan of animation to enjoy this piece. So, if you come across it, give it a chance."
"Plot twist, after plot twist, twisting time at every second. As in every Satoshi Kon film, time is warped, un-bended and bended again, but it is always engaging and fantastical to watch. Black Swan definitely seems to have been inspired by this, for it is simply perfect... blue. Still don't know why it's called that."
"""Perfect Blue"" is a very, very dark anime...so don't let your kids watch it thinking it's like ""Pokemon"" or ""Inuyasha""! It's also a confusing mind-bending sort of film...one that certainly is unique.When the anime begins, Mima is in an up and coming pre-packaged Japanese girl bands. However, her agent convinces her to leave this life and pursue a career in films. But this way to success is very dark and soul-crushing and soon they have her in a film featuring a rape, lots of violence and nudity. All the while, Mima struggles with herself. She hates what she's doing but in the world of female pop stars and starlets, she feels a sense of obligation and won't publicly question the folks looking after her career. Now at this point, the film gets weird...really, really weird. Mima seems to be losing her mind and some murders occur...and soon the viewer is confused and they might be seeing the world through the eyes of a lunatic...or a killer! What's it all mean? See the film and TRY to unravel it all...but don't be surprised if you still are questioning what it all means.This is a very clever film and its plot is deep and very strange...and I liked that. But be forewarned...the film shows some very sexually explicit and violent scenes...even by Japanese standards (the film features pubic hair...something very taboo in Japanese culture). Well done and worth seeing...but just don't let the kids see it or anyone who have been sexually abused as a few of the scenes just might be too intense."
"Before ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Black Swan"" there was Satoshi Kon's ""Perfect Blue"", an anime thriller which ends with your jaw on the ground. After you reassemble your face, you start mumbling to yourself: ""what the hell?"", ""holy crap"", ""this is messed up"", ""oh my god"", ""are you serious?"" Satoshi Kon's films often have mind bending, ambitious narrative structures, but this trend started with ""Perfect Blue"", his first feature. An examination of identity, celebrity, sexism, alienation and exploitation under patriarchy, the film revolves around Mima, a pop-singer who leaves her pop band, CHAM, to begin a career as an actress. But as Mima is forced into racier material, the film's narrative begins to break down, points-of-view, dreams, nightmares and private delusions overlapping and co-mingling. Are we witnessing a nervous breakdown induced by a deeply disturbing culture, or perhaps something more? In truth, the film's blending at least four points of view. You have Mima, a young woman who so craves fame and celebrity that she's willing to sell her body and submit to all manners of consented debasement. Then you have the fans, particularly one deranged fan, who sees Mima as his product, his fantasy object which he must both control and defend. This fan obsessively tracks the details of Mima's daily life and reacts violently when outside sources try to change her image. Then you have men, always leering with cameras, eyes or controlling via chequebooks and ink pens; the vast moral abyss of a phallocentric entertainment industry. Finally, you have women, in particular one woman, a chubby, motherly woman who seems like a caretaker but reveals herself to be a killer who pines for her lost youth and beauty; she pits herself against Mima in a fit of rage and jealousy. Significantly, Mima attempts to spare the life of this woman, a gesture which positions us to sympathise with the caretaker. She too is a victim, a pawn in a battle which pits sister against sister, the result of a culture which demands conformity, perfection, submission, bows to the tyranny of the image and is obsessed with a form of feminine perfection which, at its worst, leads to mental instability and collapse.The rights to ""Perfect Blue"" were bought by Darren Aronofsky, who cribbed some of its shots, scenes, ideas and themes for 2010's ""Black Swan"" (he changes Mima's name to Nina, makes her a ballet dancer and even uses some of Mima's scenes in his earlier film, ""Requiem For a Dream""). Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" is also very similar. Both Lynch and Satoshi posit women as victims of a male dominated culture, though, whilst Aronofsky's film casts women as its chief villains, and largely lets its victimisers (and us) off scott-free.Like ""Perfect Blue"", these are all essentially films about a rape culture. In bygone days, women weren't deemed human beings. For the ruling class, the total ownership and possession of women was something to take pride in, young girls were frequently ""gifted"" and virgins offered as trophies to rulers (the sanctity around virginity continues today). The ""conquest"" of women used to be the norm, and rape was never treated as an exception or aberration. As capitalism firmly enforces the class divide and plays into the hands of the traditionally oppressive gender, such a rape culture continues to this day, though in new and much less obvious ways. And as men themselves are increasingly neutered, films like ""Perfect Blue"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" are starting to be made about male figures. Consider ""Magic Mike"", which focuses on the collapse of a male stripper.Aesthetically, ""Perfect Blue"" is the darkest of Satoshi's features. His palette is all dark blues and inky blacks, his Japan one of tiny cubicles and deeply alienated urbanites, and most of his characters are vile and perverted. Doubles and doppelgangers also feature throughout. Characters named Rumi and Mima are paired, for example, both names meaning ""beautiful"" in Japanese. The film's stiffer and has a lower frame rate than modern anime, which will put some viewers off. It was nevertheless somewhat ahead of its time, and remains one of the better anime's of the mid 90s.8/10 – Worth two viewings."
"Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller about a singer in a pop trio, Mima, who turns to acting because of the lack of successes that she feels she is achieving in music. Ironically, after she leaves her former singing partners become far more successful as a duo than they have ever been working with her. As Mima turns towards acting, she discovers that a stalker has been making posts about her on his fan-page detailing Mima's day-to day experience as she transitions to acting. These things began to manifest themselves in Mima's mind and embody a separate personality that haunts her throughout this film. I am not usually drawn to anime but this film really poked at my curiosity. Mostly because of the stories I have heard about the esteemed director, Darren Aronofsky, buying the rights to this film for $60k in order to, not only replicate a seen from this film in his critically-acclaimed masterpiece, Requiem for a Dream, but also to allegedly replicate aspects of Perfect Blue in his Oscar-winning movie, Black Swan. At first, I was kind of confused about why he did this. But after watching Perfect Blue, I can kind of see why. This film is one of the most intense and disorienting films that I have seen in a while. So it's understandable that a director trying to achieve the same unique effect would try to mimic this movie. We see Mima's alternative personality, 'pop-star Mima', eat this woman inside-out. Mima moves toward more smutty and gritty content in her new acting career. She is playing a girl that gets raped in the new television series she has been cast in, she is letting a photographer take nude photos of her, and she is slowly retreating into more and more into her own mind while doing so. All while her former co-stars are gaining success without her. This causes this her stalker and her alternative personality that is manifesting her consciousness to become more invasive and violent. This film, at times, allows us to feel the same sort of disorientation and confusion that Mima is feeling, especially with the twist ending that leaves you thinking about this film long after it is finished. There is a portion of the movie where Mima keeps waking up from a sleep after each scene, as to suggest that everything that happened before was just a dream. This sequence left me so confused and the pacing made me so dizzy that I thought I was going to fall out of my seat. There are a lot of scenes in this film where you start to question what is real and what isn't. Perfect Blue is stylistically unsettling and memorizing, but still beautifully animated and edited. The film's score is unnerving. The English-dubbed vocal-performances don't sound out-of-place or corny like they do in most anime. I like how mature this film is. It intensifies until the very end without trying to break the tension with any humor or explain things to the audience. It is a dark look into the psychological darkness of being a pawn in the world of pop- culture. I hope to find some more anime like this in the future. I think that this film is a good stepping stone for anyone who is trying to get into anime. If you are trying to watch something that may keep you up at night, if you are trying to watch something that is thought provoking, if you like films with a complex plot and storyline watch this film. You won't regret it."
"The first time I watched PERFECT BLUE I was underwhelmed. I disliked what I perceived to be the 'supernatural' element of the movie. I watched it again several months later, intending to get rid of my DVD, and realised that I had missed the whole point of the film!PERFECT BLUE is actually a very good, intelligent movie. Director, Satoshi Kon, was employed to make an exploitation flick using the original PERFECT BLUE novel as his source material. Kon disliked the script the studio provided and, when he asked how rigidly he had to stick to the plot, was told that he had to keep three elements of the story: a singing idol, a stalker and horror. Using these elements he and writer Sadayuki Murai created what is effectively a coming-of-age story about a young woman leaving one stage of her life and entering another.The plot can seem contrived and the ending is a little silly (though it is quite meaningful when looking at the film as a story about growing up). Also the animation is not too great -this was only a straight to video feature, after all. However, if you can get past these problems, this is a very enjoyable movie.7/10"
"I get nearly all my movie recommendations from IMDb readers of my comments. I'm a student of ""folding,"" which often exhibits as a mix of reality, a movie within the movie, or an imagined reality.Here we have all three in a very clever and engaging mix that could only have been pulled off in the anime format. I actually invested a lot in watching this because once someone goes to the trouble of weaving so many realities, it is common to maintain ambiguities about which is the ""true"" reality.In this case, it could be the reality of the teevee show, or of the website, or of the ""gaslight"" imagined world. Let me advise you not to take this as seriously as I did, because it has a huge copout at the end.That ending is a scooby-doo explanation where all worlds but the ""real"" one are taken away. A crazy person in a costume is the villain. I suppose it could be recommended as training in moviewatching sophistication for kids.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"This movie is one of the best anime films I've seen. It heavily influenced darron aronofsky's black swan. It even has topics that are relevant to this day. Its direction is masterful and its script is great. Its terrifying,disturbing and a masterpiece."
"Well, what can be said about this movie that hasn't been said. To me personally this movie is flawless. It is the embodiment of all the things that I love about the Asian cinema. It has the dark tone: emptiness, shallowness, hopelessness etc.Satoshi Kon is a visionary, his movies are ahead of their time, I know that both Perfect Blue and Paprika inspired many western movies such as Inception, Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream and many others. I love the way that he handles such complex story lines. If you can get through the layer of complexity you will soon realize that these movies are not complex just for being complex, these stories are a heavy commentary on how our society functions and how an individual functions in such society.Among many other topics, Perfect Blue touches on the double identity that almost every person assumes. The public persona and the private. It shows how chaotic can everything get once you lose track of which is which. It shows how even the seemingly perfect people can sometimes be perfectly lonely. Hence the title. Perfect Blue, which I think suggests perfect sadness.In my opinion this movie is timeless and the topics that it touches on are ever so relevant these days. It is unfortunate that this genius of a movie maker had to meet his untimely demise."
"First a manga comics illustrator, Satoshi Kon graduated to filmed anime with ""Perfect Blue"" (1997) about a pop singer stalked by a fan. 'Perfect Blue' takes its cues from the 'Giallo' of Dario Argento, whilst exploring 'otaku' (obsessive fan culture) and the condition of celebrity itself.Mima is a squeaky-clean, desexualised innocent, inhabiting a world that is ready to swallow her up. A singer in the marginally popular bubblegum pop teen trio 'CHAM!,' as the film opens Mima and her partners are performing a free concert in a Tokyo park. During the course of the set, Mima announces that she's leaving the group to pursue an acting career. Some fans are displeased with her sudden career change, particularly a stalker named Me Mania. Mima's life quickly begins to spiral when someone starts trying to drive her out of her mind; or is she just cracking up all on her own? Me-Mania, who has a mask like face reminiscent of Reggie Nalder from Argento's 'Bird With The Crystal Plumage,' is revealed to have been impersonating her on a web site / blog he created, called 'Mima's Room.' When Mima's friend and manager hooks her up to the Internet, she discovers the fanatical 'Mima's Room' site, and learns that someone knows her every waking move, leaving her paranoid and unsure of how to proceed. Things go from bad to worse when Mima's associates start dying in brutal ways. The plot of 'Double Blind' (the TV soap she gets a small role in), begins to parallel Mima's troubles and her tenuous grip on reality, as the soap has her playing a girl who believes she is a pop idol. 'Perfect Blue' like 'Double Blind' has a narrative that cuts between reality and nightmares, as Mima becomes haunted by a figmentary alter-ego who starts to elbow into her identity. The delusional states of fan and idol are shown to be complementary as well as interdependent. A notorious acted out rape scene for the TV show 'Double Bind,' results in the narrative becoming particularly fragmented just like Mima. She is disorientated and on the edge of madness.As an aside, Darren Aronofsky purchased the American rights to 'Perfect Blue' for $59,000, so he could film the brief ""bath scene"" with Jennifer Connelly in his own film 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000). The staged rape scene in 'Perfect Blue' also inspired a scene toward the end of Aronofsky's film in which a group of men circle around and cheer on two women using a double ended dildo."
"I usually pride myself on figuring out the twist or ending of a thriller long before it's formally revealed, but I'm proud to say that Perfect Blue kept me in the dark right up until it was ready to divulge its secrets. Anyone who likes anime and is looking for a good mystery will fall right in love with Perfect Blue.It's difficult to give much of a sense of what the film is about with spoiling the plot. But essentially, its about a Japanese pop singer named Mima who leaves her musical group and decides to become an actress. She's not entirely happy about the things that she's forced to deal with in her new career, and she starts experiencing odd hallucinations as people around her start to die in brutal ways. This is definitely an intense movie, and some of the scenes are very violent. It's nothing that a fan of action anime hasn't been exposed to before, but it bares mentioning anyway.I thought the pacing was a little slow at the beginning, but this pays off well once the story gets going, so maybe that's not too big of a deal. The art style leans toward realism in a very pleasing way that aids in telling such a serious story. I'm sure that there are not very many serious anime fans that haven't seen Perfect Blue, and with good reason. It's an excellent thriller that surpasses many of the live-action movies in the genre that I've seen recently."
"A pop star tries to make the transition to acting, but all these pesky murders keep getting in the way. It's basically anime giallo as Satoshi Kon channels Argento and Bava in this psychological thriller. It gets a bit repetitive at points, but it provides a few surprises and is sufficiently entertaining. The short running time is a big asset, any more of this and it would probably wear out its welcome. I did think most of the animation was rather mechanical and unappealing, though. Also, despite the quasi-feminist viewpoint, there's an awful lot of rape. However, I enjoyed it more than the other two Kon films I've seen."
"In its combination of fractured female psyches, trauma, and perverse show business glamour (in this case pop singing and Japanese TV) reminiscent of David Lynch, although predating Mulholland Dr. by a few years, Perfect Blue is another take in the always compelling 'woman losing her grip on reality' niche. You've seen before in films like The Stunt Man the meta-narrative tricks of using scenes and lines from a movie inside the movie (in this case a Japanese soap crime thriller) as a tool in showing the protagonist's reality being undermined, but they work marvellously here. There's point where I couldn't tell exactly WHO the protagonist was (pop singer turned soap actress, strip dancer living a wish fulfillment fantasy to cope with post traumatic stress disorder caused by rape) any more than she did. A bit haphazard opening and awful closing line but Japanese animeister Satoshi Kon throws a nice Argento homage in the finale complete with blood gushing from glass shard wounds. I have anime associated with nauseating teenyboppery in my mind but this is superb adult stuff, mindbending with a surreal edge and a directorial eye for detail and style. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a major influence for 00's Lynch."
"A lot of users and critics have said that Perfect Blue is like an Alfred Hitchcock film, but it seems to me that it's more like a Brian De Palma remake of Hitchcock's Frenzy (the only Hitchcock film that I'm aware of that has a graphic rape scene).  That's not to say that it's not a good movie, it's just that Hitchcock films had more subtlety, and you often had to imagine the more graphic elements yourself (just look at the Psycho shower scene or the amputation in Lifeboat).Spoilers: Oddly enough, the first murder is treated like a Hitchcock murder (the attack isn't even shown), whereas the second (and actually imagined) murder is just downright gruesome in its unflinching depiction.  The rape scene, on the otherhand, is probably the most effective I've ever seen, despite (or maybe because of) the fact that it is a: animated, b: a movie, and c: a staged rape for a television show within the movie.  In fact, Mima reacts to the faux-rape as if it were a real rape, phasing out of her self (""dissociation,"" in psychological terms).Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is more De Palma, and it almost made me wish that the imagined sequence (when the Double Bind actors said that Mima created a new life as an actress for herself after being raped in a strip club) was the real story.  It would have been more interesting, realistic, and fitting for the movie."
"( spoilers lie within. ) I've been hoping for an anime like this to reach these shores for ages. Despite the sci-fi fantasy and giant robots the genre is famous for, it's perfectly capable of making any sort of film.  Take Wings of Honneamise for example; basically a sweet drama about the first space program of a (spectacularly designed) fictional world.  It was around ten years ago that story appeared in the West, now Perfect Blue ably picks up the mantle.  And it's probably the best psychological thriller I've seen for a long time, filmed or drawn.Much has been said about it along the lines of ""Hitchcock goes to Japan"" and it's not far wrong.  Most of what people call thrillers these days are actually over cooked detective stories.  However helpless or innocent the protagonists, they usually operate with the resources and/or sanction and authority of some official body, be it the cops or the FBI or someone else. These stories can be great, but there's something more thrilling about fairly ordinary folks with no such know-how dropped into horrible situations.  It's hard tale to spin and none did better or more often than Hitchcock.  Now we have an anime proving it can cut it in this tough sub genre.The story, as if you didn't read the front page, goes like this: Mima is a sheltered girl, living in a protective publicity bubble as a member of the squeaky clean J-pop trio called Cham.  They've had some modest success and have a good following, but haven't really got off the ground in a major way. At a small comic fair appearance she announces her retirement from the group to pursue acting.  When she gets home she starts getting strange phone calls and faxes.  She also fumbles her way onto the internet after being rattled by an obtuse, but innocent, fan letter.  There she discovers a web site put up by someone speaking as her, detailing everything about her life right down to her thoughts and regrets about her new job, her superstitious habits and her every purchase.  As things go along it seems without the group she really is a nobody.  The acting isn't an instant success.  Her standards begin to slip in grabs for acceptance and publicity.  And under the weight of the job, fear, regret and loneliness she gradually cracks up. Then people around her start dying.This film is brilliantly put together.  In the slow and deliberate early stages we watch her uneventful life for a while, pushing for more air time in a drama series and a few mildly unsettling moments (letter bomb aside), nothing much happening really.  Then we're slammed in the face.  The script even foreshadows it beautifully; ""Mima, your character undergoes a psychological transformation after a brutal gang rape in a nightclub"".  Then we watch them film it; take after take, camera set up after set up, long lurid close ups for what seems like forever.  The crew and production staff seem slightly ashamed, to say nothing of her managers.  People in the audience are turning away.  I'm one of them, but I have to grin about how damn brilliant this is.  It's just an unevenly dubbed cartoon isn't it? Well this is just the start of the rollercoaster ride.  The effectiveness of this also speaks volumes about the character development, notable in Mima herself and her managers.  Handling this sheltered and delicate personality whilst trying to do their job and get her work and publicity in an unforgiving business (to say nothing of the fact that the rest of Cham are still with the agency and are starting to become quite a breakthrough success).  It's all very well done.  Another example; when her vague and hallucinatory behaviour seems to be getting too intense and prolonged (despite the rape scene and other things) the explanation is handed to us, perfectly timed.  She's been reading the stalker web site religiously as a sort of emotional crutch.  While the site itself has slowly changed tone to one of describing (as her) the kind of life she should have had.  And she starts to agree, or maybe she is updating it.As others have noted, this film seems to echo a couple of reality bending films, beating them to the punch in some cases.  Requiem for a Dream, Memento and even Fight Club spring to mind. The former involving dreams, ideals and regrets sitting alongside a slide into usettling seediness (and stealing a great moment shot for shot from Perfect Blue, as others also note), the latter two having scenes that are confusingly without proper context or meaning until a bit later in the film and generally being about losing your self and forgetting what you have or have not done. 
Although I found the ending a little awkward (they usually are in this kind of film) I didn't see it coming and it does sit well with everything else. The light epilogue being another somewhat Hitchcockian touch.  Don't let all my comparisons distract though.  It's a damn fine film in its own right.  I imagine it's even better with the original dialogue.  See it on the big screen if you can."
"The film revolves around a Japanese pop idol who leaves a girl group to start a career in acting. However she is uncertain about her move and is followed by ghosts both real and imagined from her previous life. Like in Paprika Satoshi Kon plays with the meaning of reality and what it means to be sane. The sense of paranoia and uncertainty of ones own senses when experiencing an emotional trauma is well conveyed here. However ultimately the film feels too flat for my tastes. Paprika is a lively colourful and imaginative romp into the world of insanity. This on the other hand is much more controlled and realistic, and while that would usually be something that recommends a film here it ends up falling flat. I kept hopping the film would sprout wings and explore the realm of paranoia and insanity the way only anime can really do so but it never really truly delivers."
"Anyone who can get past the fact that ""Perfect Blue"" is animated should see it.  Well, anyone who is over 17, I should say.  Don't let the anime look fool you, this is a great psychological thriller meant for adults.  It's intelligent, confusing, thought-provoking, violent and mesmerizing.  The animation is good and gets better as the movie progresses.  The English dub is actually very good, especially the woman who voiced Mima Kirigoe, the main character; that had to be a tough job.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:  The movie begins with a series of flashbacks that show Mima's departure from Cham, a moderately successful pop trio.  She has decided to pursue an acting career instead.  Soon after getting her first acting gig by participating in dirty and disturbing scenes in a drama series, Mima discovers a website which is run by someone claiming to be her, in an effort to keep her pristine pop idol image alive for her fans.  Cham is becoming more successful as a duo and Mima is visited by an illusion of her old self who ridicules her choice of becoming a slutty actress.  As the drama series goes on, it begins to parallel Mima's real-life delusions. People close to her are being murdered and her grasp on reality begins to slip.  Unable to distinguish between reality and make-believe, Mima slowly deteriorates until she comes face to face with the one who wants to do her in. There are two English versions of this movie: an edited rated-R version and an unedited director's cut which is not rated.  If it were, it would be very close to being NC-17.  I found both versions floating around in the same library system, so if you plan to see the movie, make you know what you're getting.  I'd recommend the director's cut, only because you'll miss some important imagery and emotion in the edited version.  There's a lengthy rape scene, albeit staged, that is disturbing after awhile, but it's not as gratuitous as it seems; it does serve a purpose in showing Mima's grasp on reality beginning to fade.  I could do without the rape scene, but another important montage was cut from the edited version, due to nudity.  Either version is great for adults over 17.  I can't imagine anyone younger seeing the director's cut, it's pretty nasty and not something a kid can appreciate for it's symbolism.  I would also recommend this movie to any of the pop divas that grace our T.V.'s and clog the airwaves everyday, especially the ones who want to act-we know who they are.  It might freak them out senseless!"
"It's as if one of Dario Argento's giallos had been mixed up with Japanese ghost story elements into an Anime psycho shocker... with all of the strengths and weaknesses intact.Basically, the animation is just average, but is elevated through some clever visual flourishes, which underline the central issue of what's real and what's just illusion. An old hat, to be sure, but there are intriguing aspects to the otherwise quite silly and rather contrived story which culminates in an unfair, though effective solution.All in all, passable fare for genre aficionados.5 out of 10 brutal stabbings"
"I like some of the animation in PERFECT BLUE. Some scenes were very stiff but other scenes were beautifully rendered without being too flashy. The problem with PB is the story. It has too many implausible details like the killer being able to look like Mima, the popstar. I mean, come on! They might get away with it because it's animation but it would be impossible to recreate this in a believable fashion in a live action movie. It feels like a cheat. The only way this implausible detail could have been possible is that the killer has some sort of psychic link with Mima. Otherwise, I just can't see it as being remotely plausible. But even the idea of the killer having a psychic link with Mima can't explain the scenes were we see the killer without Mima being around, like the ""pizza boy"" scene. The fact that the killer looked like the ""pizza boy"" during that scene really doesn't make any sense at all. Also, the fact that a popstar quits her group because she thinks the image of a pop idol is suffocating her is a tad ludicrous in this case because CHAM are almost unknown and have never had a top 100 hit when Mima was part of it! Now how suffocating can that be? The story would have made more sense if CHAM had been popular. PB is filled with violence and nudity and a simulated rape scene, which makes this a DEFINITE R-rated anime, even though everything else looks like something straight out of SAILOR MOON. What's also interesting is how they completely leave out the idea that Mima can have a boyfriend or even friends. Leaving the pop band doesn't mean Mima can't be friends with the other members of CHAM.Anyway, the film is entertaining and it does have some spooky qualities that make it really interesting. But it's a tad overrated. I give it 6 out of 10.A couple of points:Am I the only who thinks that the ugly creep was made to look like Michael Jackson?The first song CHAM play at the beginning sounds a lot like that song from the French band, 2be3."
"Like Satoshi Kon's much better film Millennium Actress, Perfect Blue eeks out it's story like a meandering beach comer turning over stones; any inherent poetry of that description doesn't apply to Perfect Blue, however.  Unlike Millennium Actress, Kon never manages to build an emotional connection between the viewer and the characters, leaving a dispassionate barrier.Barred beneath a plot of tasteless sand there may be a glimpse of sentiment that could warrant artistic expression- unfortunately, those who crafted this mechanically orchestrated opera didn't believe in that sentiment enough to imbue any great worth or artistic beauty when rendering it.At the hart of the Perfect Blue is the question: do I like who I've become? Satoshi Kon wraps that question in a package of insanity and couples it with the warn out tedium of a psycho killer.   In the end, Kon seems unable to tell the story he wants to, doesn't seem to know why, and forgets what question he's trying to answer in the process."
"Mima: ""Excuse me who are you"".The story is about a retired a pop idol, worshipped by the masses until fashion dictated otherwise. In order to salvage her career, she is advised to drop music and pursue acting. A soap opera role is offered but Mima's character is less clean cut than desired. Regardless, she agrees and events take a turn for the worse. She begins to feel reality slip, that her life is not her own. She discovers (imagines) her identical twin, a mirror image that hasn't given up singing. Internet sites appear describing every intimate detail of her life and a figure stalks her from the shadows. Her friends and associates are threatened (and killed) as Mima descends into a dangerous world of paranoid delusion. She fears for her life and must unravel fact from illusion in order to stay alive. Perfect Blue represents a major change from traditional anime subject matter, analysing the pop icon phenomenon, fame and its psychological impact on the performer.It always shocks me how some people can dare to over look things, solid masterpieces out there but people still over look them and go see other films that are just stick in the mood basic films. I just adore the feeling of not knowing anything at the first then be amazed after wards and a film that get's you thinking as well, not like movies today that always play it save by doing the simple three act structure that I normally skip if I had the chance. Perfect Blue can be best described has a movie that you don't just put your feet up, sit back and have a delightful time, no in this you got to use your brain and try your best to piece it together to get the movie. Perfect Blue is Anime that got under my skin and drove the main character and me insane.A quick fun fact here but Black Swan is actually a remake of this movie, yes to those who didn't know that well you do now. If I have to compare what's the better movie I got to say that overall Black Swan is a great movie, but I liked Perfect Blue a lot more so Perfect Blue all the way.The animation in this never looked so well done, so beautiful but also scary and so haunting to look at. At times I thought I was watching a Hayao Miyazaki movie or a Stanley Kubrick film at one point, just be the switch of the atmosphere like it's peacefulness and then a utterly insane feeling to the movie.For problems: Without spoiling anything the ending to me didn't end on a good note in my opinion. It isn't terrible it's just that it left me there going ""Nah"".Overall Perfect Blue is an dark and twisted Anime movie with beautiful but haunting animation that sells the movie off has a deep thinking movie that you shouldn't get lost on track if you really want to understand the film. The film is a slow cult following that I will totally recommend to people who love Anime and analyzing films."
"I must say I was disappointed in this one and expected a bit more from Satoshi Kon.It started as a celebrity-wannabe drama, developed into personality crisis drama and only then into something you could call a thriller. The beginning was really dragging on, many characters seemed stereotypical (sure, it's always the nerd and the fat woman behind everything) and the main character appeared superficial. The ending was also very disappointing: just as things started to get really good it turned into an average scene where a maniac is chasing an innocent girl, moreover, the last episode was just corny.However, this anime did have some excellent parts. The scenes where reality gets mixed up with dreams and Mima's role in the movie were marvelous. I ended up utterly confused and on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next.All in all, 'Perfect Blue' doesn't have much to surprise you with but it might be a good way to kill your boredom."
"Perfect Blue: If the term ""Anime"" conjures up images of robot-warriors or demons, (or god forbid  Pokemon!), fantasy plots, static Cubist animation, androgynous hybrid heroes/heroines, horrible lip-synching, and blood splattering across the screen in Peckinpah proportions you're not alone. But a well -crafted, psychological thriller?   Anything's possible Mima Kirigoe is the lead vocalist of Cham a Japanese  Spice-Girls clone. Tired of her vacuous pop-idol status she announces that she is leaving the group to pursue an acting career.   Away from the warmth of the spotlight and relegated to bit roles, Mima becomes introspective and depressed.  Her only solace is the Mima homepage: created by a devoted fan it lyrically details her career in first person and reminds her of happier days.  At least temporarilyAfter Mima accepts the role of an emotionally disturbed character with a dark side, the tone of the homepage turns sinister and it becomes apparent that she is being stalked.   Soon after two of her colleagues are brutally murdered, and several clues point to her involvement.  Tormented by nightmares and hallucinations Mima begins to experience difficulty separating her sleeping and waking states, and appears destined for life in a sanitarium.  Can she escape the spiral  before she reaches the point of no return? This is the second full-length anime feature that I have seen in as many months (Princess Mononoke being the first) and I was surprised by the effect it had on me.  What begins as a pleasant, innocuous music video, rapidly devolves into a disturbing movie within a movie.  From the intrusive sounds (the phones sound like chapel bells), to the scripted rape scene, to the brutal murders, the experience, both aural and visual, is extremely powerful.  This intensity helps enhance the seamless blending of reality and fantasy - you really can't distinguish between the two.  Is Mima really a pop star/actress, or a wannabe with delusions of grandeur who has completely lost touch with reality?  Whenever you think you've figured out what's happening, they fake you out again.  Being kept constantly off balance in this manner is very disquieting and I can only imagine that that's what it must be like for someone on the edge of madness.  I know it's a trip I don't planning on booking anytime soon. If you've ever been curious about this genre, and enjoy suspense, you won't be disappointed."
"This movie is a very dark, surreal psychological thriller that really messes with your head. Often, you're not sure if the scene you're watching is really happening or if it's a dream, hallucination or a scene from a TV show. I liked this but I think it got a little overused after a while and will undoubtably confuse some viewers. The story was gripping and well-writted and the animation was quite good.This is a good movie for fans of anime or good Hitchcockian thrillers. I should point out though that it's definitely not for everyone."
"Mima Kirigoe. A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima's abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version.The late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as ""anime"", is cited as ""childish"". ""Anime is for losers"" tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai's narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form.The complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female's world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from.Kon's intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series 'Double Bind' essentially replicating Mima's regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima's mental instability. He doesn't stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It's not just a psychological thriller. It's horror.Kon's signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of ""Me-Mania"", only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi's audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent.The reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon's trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words ""perfection"", it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating. Quite possibly the best anime feature to ever be released."
"Perfect blue is.... perfect...good movie. i like.
w a t c h"
"Pros:
Really cool themes, public figures losing themselves to the idealized persona that the public and their employers demand of them
Good music, good animation for idol girls
Decent horror scenesCons:
Mindbender scenes end up being too much, a lot of imagery doesn't make sense and doesn't add to the themes as much as the concrete stuff
Bad twist late into the movie
Stiff animation on some conversation scenesBest part: the crazed fan talking to himself as the idol girl, very creepy and fitting to the identity stealing theme
Worst part: waking up on the same morning 4 times, a bit too confusing and unnecessary"
"Sets standards for upcoming thriller movies in this genre so high that will be hard to match!!!! You won,t know what,s real or not."
"One of the best anime films I've ever watched. I go back to re-watch this beauty year after year and it never disappoints. If you've watched Black Swan you will definitely see a lot of similarities, which is because this film was an inspiration for it. It illustrates the mental toll of fame and the warning to never trust ""friends"" who will exploit you for fame. There are multiple twists in the film, lots of honest brutality that does not hold back, and when it all comes together makes a truly satisfying ending.I would highly recommend giving this classic a view, even if you're not an anime fan. And go check out Satoshi Kon's other works (Paprika, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers, etc.). He and Miyazaki are anime legends."
"It leaves you on the edge of your seat. What is real and what is illusion? All blurry and within the other. Dark, disturbing and so, so thrilling. I'm seriously regretting now that I haven't seen this earlier and it definitely is in my top 10 list.""Excuse me, who are you?"""
"Perfect Blue is Satoshi Kon's 1st movie as a director. It combines the works of Alfred Hitchcock & David Lynch into 1 big suspenseful anime. According to Roger Corman, he said that if Alfred Hitchcock partnered with Walt Disney, they would make a picture like this.Perfect Blue tells the story of a retired pop singer named ""Mima Kirigoe"" who wanted to become an actress. During her transition, she begins to lose her sense of reality as the people she works with starts to turn up dead. Things start to kick in shortly after the ""fake"" rape sequence at a strip club while the direct-to-video series called ""Double Bind"" is currently filming. A stalker named ""Mr. Me-Mania"" becomes obsessed with her, her alter ego starts to chase her, & a website called ""Mima's Room"". After the terrifying climax sequence, everything goes back to normal. But immediately before the credits start, Mima says those words...
""No. I'm the real thing"".Perfect Blue is 1 of the scariest & most confusing animated movies I've ever seen in my life. I was 14 when I 1st saw that film, & a lot of people as they are watching the film are like ""What the f*ck was going on?"". I understood what happened. It was a terrifying masterpiece.Perfect Blue currently has 7.9/10 stars on IMDB & no score on Metacritic. The current percentage on Rotten Tomatoes is 77% percent with an average of 7.01/10. MyAnimeList currently has 8.4/10 stars. If I were in control of the Metacritic system, I would give the film an 83/100.Perfect Blue is also based on the novel by ""Yoshikazu Takeuchi"". The score is done by ""Masahiro Ikumi"". The soundtrack can be very creepy & catchy. It will send shivers down your spine.Darren Aronofsky loved the movie so much, he used the same scene in Requiem for a Dream with Jennifer Connelly which currently has 8.3/10 stars on IMDB. Black Swan is also a movie directed by Darren Aronofsky which is very similar to Perfect Blue. It also stars Natalie Portman in that movie.For those of you who haven't seen the movie, watch both the English Dub & the English Sub. I only saw the English Dub, & it was good. But remember, your alter ego will keep an eye on you.OVERALL: 10/10"
"Introduction: Perfect Blue is one of my favorite anime films. A film that really understands horror and fear. It takes the stalker premise, and makes a really good film out of it. What can I say Perfect Blue is almost a perfect moive.The Story & Characters: The film centers around a retired pop star, who is stalked by a crazy fan. And the film takes the premise, and turns it into a horrifying thrill ride. As the film is able to really get under the skin. You really sympathize with the main character's struggle, as she is pulled into is tough situation. and the stalker is a really threatening antagonist.The Animation: The style of animation is pretty good. While the quality is not as good as I hoped. But I still enjoy it. Some of the visuals are really nice. And the darker colors set the tone of the film. The animation of the film however, looks like a direct to video film at times. I still like the animation and the film, but it has a few flaws.Conclusion: Perfect Blue is a near perfect film. I enjoy every second of this film. And upon rewatch, I can always find something else to love. It's a great anime that I'd recommend any long time fan, or beginner."
"Watched for MyAnimeList's Anime Watching Challenge 2019 - Watch an anime Featured in an article from 2018 onwardPerfect Blue is an anime film known throughout the horror community for being a twisted psychological journey. Released in the 90s, Perfect Blue had a lot to try and stand up to in the years of psychological thrillers being released month after month. It had to make a name for itself and stand out among many similar genre movies and shows.And it did it perfectly.Perfect Blue is a stunning thriller that delves into the psyche of idol life. It's a dark and twisting journey that leaves you confused in the best way possible before revealing what you couldn't have thought possible for the storyline. Alongside its beautiful classic anime style, the voice actors bring these characters to life in the truly most spectacular of ways. They feel like real people, developed and alive in the world we sit in; I found myself caring for Mima as though she were a younger sister or a friend. The story left me with an unsettled feeling in my stomach and anxiety gnawing at the corners of my mind as I scanned scene after scene looking for any hidden clues I was missing.This movie left me in shock, reeling and hungry for a lot more than what we got. It did everything perfectly, played the viewer into believing things so spectacularly, I didn't even notice obvious hints that things weren't to be believed. I was thrown from loop after loop in the best way possible and this has a definite rewatch factor of at least seven out of ten.This is a stunning film that's truly intriguing without even trying - horror fans should definitely give it a try and see what they think. Turn off the lights, settle back with earphones and the volume up as loud as you dare and allow yourself to be taken on a twisted journey through the psyche, stalking, and the darker side of idol life."
I tried to get into the world of director Satoshi Kon once with Paprika and failed miserably because at the time my mind still very young and stupid but after few years later I'm finally tried it again with his debut Perfect Blue and my god for an anime movie from 1997 the message I got from it definitely aged pretty damn well. Perfect Blue is one haunting and deeply disturbing piece of anime about the dark side of Japanese Idol worship culture that for the rest of the world may sound bizarre but thank to the power of social media nowadays the story is as relevant as ever when you can literally learn all about one individual with a duble mouth click. My mind still feel a bit numb toward the third arc because there some scene don't make any sense but at least the anime end with a proper ending unlike Cam (2018) a horror movie with a somewhat similar concept but horribly executed.
"The movie follows the story of Mima, a singer, who wants to be an actress. But this change won't be easy. When I started watching the movie, I didn't know what should I expect. As the story built I thought it could be a very interesting concept of obsession, harassment and passion. But for my surprise it turned out to be a very decent psycho thriller. One of the best I've ever seen. The feeling of this movie is really creepy and dark, the music is always suspenseful during the key scenes. And finally the story is great, twisted but it's not hard to understand. This film is a hidden gem among the japanese anime movies."
"One of the most thematically grounded movies I've seen in a very long time. Not to say a lot about the mind-bending theme itself, but that it poses some scary questions some very fundamental notions of self and identity and the integral role of the society in it. The most entertaining part for me though was when on rewatches I could consciously decode the symbolism and nuance which created a lot of suffocating atmosphere that most of the movie revels in.
A word of advice for psychological-thriller enthusiasts: This is an obviously confusing movie, but that doesn't mean that it's a puzzle to be solved. The confusion isn't the major hook (unlike say, Memento), it pays deference to the central theme. Everything isn't supposed to be clear - and that's exactly the point. So I think to enjoy this fully one should view the events from the protagonists POV and read her state of mind instead."
"Perfect Blue is a masterfully directed film with an amazing script. It's a thrilling experience and a great social commentary towards Japan's idol obsession. The composition on this movie is beautiful and definitely helps making the movie as great as it is. For a directorial debut, this is fantastic.Rest in peace Satoshi Kon, you will be missed."
"The horror genre is known to be full of cheesy jump scares or poorly written plots. Notable movies that were well received by critics and the public, like The Shining or A Nightmare On Elm Street, came out over a decade ago. There has been a resurgence of good ones lately with, A Quiet Place and Get Out, but history shows how hard it is to make good horror films. In Satoshi Kun's movie, Perfect Blue, the story engrosses the watcher in the life of a pop-idol, Mima, and her career shift into acting. Idols are fantasy relationships the performer has with the audience, making them feel like they know the performer as their own best friend. Mima experiences this kind of duality as a singer and a regular person. Over the course of the movie, she grows more and more unsure about what her identity is: a singer or an actor. Mima starts to slowly descend into a path of madness, making even the watcher confused about what is truly reality. She starts to suspect herself as the murderer of people around her, obsesses over blog posts that detail her life but were not written by her, and feels as if she is pushing her acting career too far. All these events break Mima. At the end of the film, the viewer can confidently say that Mima has gone somewhat crazy, but it is not known if Mima has conquered these mental trials. If the audience knew one-hundred percent of the time what was happening in the horror movie ""Perfect Blue,"" the movie's quality would fall flat. But because of the confusing surrealism, it elevates and heightens the movie's tension and conflict with Mima's identity.
 To make reality more muddled for Mima, Satoshi Kun uses different forms of media to show two different realities, showing the uncertainty of Mima's life. In the beginning of the film, Mima is barely able to use the internet and has to be taught by Rumi, her manager, to put in a URL. Mima puts in a URL to a website sent by a fan because she was curious why it was called Mima's Blog. The blog closely follows Mima's life as if she was still a singer and has very specific details only Mima could know about. Mima is seen throughout the movie going back repeatedly to the blog and exploring this alternate reality she could have been living as a singer. Mima describes herself in the blog posts as another person saying things like, ""so, what did YOU do today?"" As she continues to read blog posts during the movie, we can see her late at night more obsessively browsing away. This obsession over Mima's blog enforces the theme that Mima lives a dual life, making her doubt her identity as she consumes more and more blog posts. In addition to the internet, Mima's acting career intrudes her mental stability. In general, it is understandable how people can get so addicted to watching a television series that is not real. For Mima, acting in her show starts to cross the line of reality. For one, the script of the show eerily mirrors the events taking place around Mima and also has completely over-the-top scenes. The script involves a mentally ill woman who believes that someone is committing murders to the people close to her, and she gets raped while in a club. Mima's acting parallels to her lost sense of reality when she recites her script dialogue like, ""who am I"" in the show, when she mixes up her own name and her character's name while rehearsing, and the fact that Rumi ends up murdering the writers of the show because of the controversial script Mima was traumatized by. Mima thinks she did the murder because she found bloody clothes planted in her closet, and the audience sees an earlier scene of Mima stabbing one of the writers writer to death, but she does not remember anything about it. The rape scene also adds onto the craziness Mima is experiencing because she actually starts to believe she is being raped. What was supposed to be acting ended up becoming reality for Mima. In addition to all of these events, the viewer can see Mima's fans watch as she transitions from an innocent idol to an adult actress. We see them watching Mima in interviews and looking at articles about Mima posing naked for a photographer, supporting the fact that Mima has developed a new celebrity persona. But as the viewer, we know that Mima's new celebrity status came at a cost of her mental health. All of these portrayals of the entertainment industry and the internet help create two realities Mima is stuck in between. 
 Along with different forms of media, Satoshi Kun takes advantage of film techniques to further emphasize the meltdown of the reality in the movie. The color grade, which is the feeling the overall color in a scene portrays, becomes more and more extreme throughout the movie. The color of the movie is realistic to what you would see in real life. As the movie progresses, the color shifts more and more towards a red hue and becomes very saturated. This can symbolize the advancement of the madness that is taking place in the movie, further supporting the broken reality. The cuts between many scenes are also stitched together to end up with a seamless transition to a different setting. For example, Mima can be seen screaming during a traumatic moment in the movie with a close up of her face. The camera is then zoomed out to show that she was only acting a scene out. This and other scenes further blur the lines to what is actually happening and what is fiction. The soundtrack in this movie is also a great strength because it is totally bizarre. A couple catchy pop songs played in the beginning when Mima was an idol quickly transform into static noises combined with other odd noises like machinery, girls humming, sounds of someone walking, techno music, howling winds, and even more. The music's structure help set the tone of every scene, adding onto the creepiness or tension Mima and you are experiencing.
 Concluding with these ideas, Satoshi Kun is able to make a great horror movie without the usual cliché jump scare. The surrealism of the movie extends the already challenging problem conflicting Mima. It is important to take note of good movies that take risks. Perfect Blue was originally going to be filmed in real life, but the animation was great and arguably even better than most live-actions. It had controversial scenes, but a strong plot that demonstrates an overall theme of the movie, which we can still relate to twenty years later. Every time I watch Perfect Blue, I feel like I am riding a roller coaster. Movies these days are more aimed to make money or serve trends that are happening, like all the super hero movies nowdays. But, it is important for audience watchers to realize that the movies they are watching should all be as thought-provoking or used to its full potential as they should be because what is the point of watching movies with no meaningful story to them."
"When people think of beloved Japanese animated filmmakers besides Miyazaki or Takahata, another notable figure in mind is Satoshi Kon. Even though he only made a few films throughout his sadly short lived life, what he left behind in the industry is nothing short of fascinating. To honor his significance, no other film would be better to look back on then his directorial debut, Perfect Blue. Known for its themes of blurred fantasy and reality, this film famously inspired Darren Aronofsky to make Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan. After 20 years of showing, it still holds up as one hell of a psychological horror.Set in Japan around the 1990s, the film centers around Mima Kirigoe, a once pop singer turned actress who becomes a victim of stalking, which causes her to lose sight between reality and fiction. With this is mind, what makes the film work is how psychological the execution is. As the film is told through different perspectives, Mima becomes challenged by fans, the press and her stalker up to the point where her mind becomes distressed. It isn't until a particular scene in the drama show she stars in where she ends up losing her track of reality. The story keeps on unraveling with more frightening imagery as it goes on, and the intentionally confusing plot adds in to the shear mystery of whether Mima is sane or not.In addition, Kon directs the transitions in a rather hypnotic format to signify what's real and what is out of this world. The usage of lighting and atmosphere really helps set the mood for each individual scene, as every time Mima becomes mixed up between reality and fantasy, the viewers really feel her sense of claustrophobic paranoia. Of course, there is plenty of violence shown throughout given the horror angle, yet the film manages to balance out the thrills in a sophisticated manner without going too over the top. Even if the film could've been done in live-action, I don't think it would've been as strong without the brilliant psychological illusions shown through the eyes of an emotionally distraught fashionista.I think we need more films like Perfect Blue, because its haunting story of a celebrity being toyed with past the point of sanity should be told more often. There are many people out there who may be famous, but their status comes with the price of being taken advantage of by those who desire them past the point of insanity. Plus, the themes of crossing reality and imagination should be taken to other directions too. Even Kon himself made a film called Millennium Actress, where an aging actress tells so many stories about her past career that it's unsure whether she's entirely correct. If a late Japanese film auteur can do it, then it's time someone else did it too."
"This film will test you. Trance-like, eerie visual/auditory ambience spell binds you while the masterfully paced but ever-escalating drama separates you from yourself. Your thoughts and emotions will be exposed. Extracted. You will understand, but still not know enough, about yourself, and about the film. The true intuitive experience of a perfect piece of Art."
"This one took me by surprise. I heard a lot about this movie and thought of giving it a shot but guess what...it's even better than it is said to be!!!
The story is mind bending, it uses a unique way of telling the a story which us visually confusing for the viewers but at the same time makes them think and enjoy the process. The twists a unpredictable and it's everything that you hoped for and even more!!!
Go for it, a 10/10 for me."
"This anime concerns a pop star who wishes to be an actor, but she also becomes a victim of stalking which leads to some serious consequences. The thin line between reality and hallucination are crossed and soon we are question what is real and what isn't. The material is strictly for adults and the artwork, as expected from the multimillion dollar anime business is stupendous. If you wish to get into anime watch this film."
"Great character development. A sour experience, don't let the cartoonish image of the film mislead you, this is a confusing not superficial film. A truly dramatic and melancholic development"
"I am not a huge anime fan, as a matter of fact I have barely seen more than five of them, but this psychological thriller is as good as any film in the genre. It concerns a pop star who wishes to be an actor, but she also becomes a victim of stalking which leads to some serious consequences. The thin line between reality and hallucination are crossed and soon we are question what is real and what isn't. The material is strictly for adults and the artwork, as expected from the multimillion dollar anime business is stupendous. If you wish to get into anime watch this film."
"One of the singular most original animated films I have ever seen. The story is about an ex pop idol who wants to become a filmstar. On a social level, it deals with the obsession of the Japanese industry with violence 
and sexual exploitation, but what captivated me most was its use of dream sequences. 
Dream sequences, or various variations of those, are not exactly a new theme. However, in most cases, they do not follow the dream logic to the extreme. Often they reduce to the common world rationality on some level, or tend to clearly distinguish between reality and dreams. However, for me, Kon's film grew organically into a film where the reality smoothly becomes the illusion, as the protagonist falls increasingly into a nighmarish reality. In my opinion, it would be very interesting to have an analysis of the film from the perspective of technological revolution, that analyzes the world of Satoshi Kon's imagination as a product of the tech bubble. To my distinction, the film managed to overcome a story to become existential in nature; pertaining questions on the nature of reality and the distinction between fiction and fact. At its best, it stayed on the level of some of Borges' finest fictions and evoked questions regarding nature of the 'lost' reality in our present age."
"A cerebral masterpiece far ahead of its time, so much that its themes of identity, perception, voyeurism & celeb fandom resonate more strongly with today's internet culture & celeb obsession, Satoshi Kon's feature film debut remains one of the finest works of its genre. A cleverly structured, expertly layered & rivetingly narrated psychological horror that's original, thrilling & suspenseful from the first frame to the last, it's an instant classic."
"""Perfect Blue"" is a 1997 anime about a young woman transitioning from a career as a pop idol to a new vocation as a serious actress. She finds that the metamorphosis is not an easy one when she tackles a sexually charged role that upsets her fans. One such fan appears to be stalking her, while her own doubts about this new direction take a toll on her psyche to the point that the line between fantasy & reality begins to become blurred.Produced on a miniscule budget of three million yen (approx. $25,000 in U.S. dollars), it must be admitted that the movie shows its limitations at times in the animation. That being said, while the visuals aren't exactly elaborate, they're consistently kept fresh with interesting directorial choices and dexterous editing that alternates between fantasy & reality with ease.The narrative is, to a certain degree, purposely difficult to follow, particularly as the movie progresses and the protagonist's state of mind begins to deteriorate. However, I found it to be adequately comprehensible on my first viewing. I wasn't entirely convinced by a late twist that seemed to come out of left field but I found that it made more sense on a second viewing.The story combines well-executed elements of the psychological thriller genre with a finale that ventures into more operatic territory reminiscent of Italian giallo. One or both of those approaches may not appeal to all viewers but I find that the movie's overall success as a psychological thriller may actually be overshadowed by its exceptional depth. This is a movie that's filled to the brim with astute observations on perception, idol worship and the nature of reality.This, I feel, is what elevates ""Perfect Blue"" above most anime movies (and most live action movies, too, for that matter). While it's unlikely to appeal to everyone, if you're looking for a smart and effective psychological thriller then ""Perfect Blue"" is well worth your time, regardless of any preconceived notions that you may have about anime. Sadly, the director (Satoshi Kon) succumbed to cancer at the young age of 46 but not before producing four distinctive anime films, of which this may be the finest."
"Alright, Okay,this is my second review for an animation/anime movie the first is 'Spirited Away' Okay let's talk about this film what can I say is this film is very disturbing I will not watch this movie again not because it no good no,it is an amazing anime movie this movie had a very strong sexual content(I don't want to talk about it you can watch it yourself)and also a very strong violence content it's severe! This movie make me had nightmare just thinking about it make fell uncomfortable but, this movie is superb the plot is so good.This is not a family's movie(it surely not!)there is a some mystery about the main character she is just in my opinion give me some uneasy feeling.I highly recommended this movie but,careful you will not gonna like it and be sure to be amazed you had been warned! My rating for this movie 10/10"
"An interesting analysis of the representation of personalities, of the difference between what you are and the way you are perceived. There's also an argument to be had about its concrete approach on women and their part in modern society. A great work by Satoshi Kon, specially in the atmosphere and pacing department. The plot-points are actually treated with the complexity they required."
"This film is really, really well made. The cinematic drawing style, the animation, the suspenseful atmosphere, everything. It really manages to evoke the fear and confusion Mima shows in the viewer as well. The way the scenes are made is brilliant: It gradually gets more bizarre an the twists made me quickly question what's real and what isn't myself.If you like psychological thrillers this is a must see. Don't let the fact that it's an anime fool you! This is nothing for children."
"A young pop singer tries to break out into acting, only to find that the psychological thriller that she is starring in has eerie parallels to her own life in this mind-bending animated drama from Japan. The plot here is rather challenging to decipher with reality and fantasy constantly blurring into one. It is also often hard to work out whether other characters are talking to her (or about her) in reality or in the film-within-the-film. While occasionally frustrating, this ambiguity is one of the film's best assets as it provides an insight into the thinking disturbed patterns of the aspiring actress and her deepest fears and insecurities. There is also a deranged stalker in the mix and an internet blog that claims to be written by her (but isn't). Also, in a personal identity crisis, she keeps seeing visions of herself as a pop icon, with the doppelganger claiming that the actress version of herself is not her real self. Director Satoshi Kon apparently only opted to animate the tale when interest for a live action incarnation began to wane, however, he manages to come up with such striking images that is hard to imagine the film having the same effect sans animation. There is an especially memorable bit in which the approaching headlights of a truck blur into stadium lights. The film also makes for a surefire curio nowadays with its insight into the early days of public domain internet where everyone could claim to be anyone."
"Anime is often seen in a stereotype that I find a bit unpleasant.Usually, anime is seen as something as not to be taken seriously or at least not too seriously. Most content is full of unnecessary sex and violence. One could argue that sex and violence is not necessary anyways. Well, the whole thing about sex and violence can be used as a benefit to telling a visually compelling story. Now I'm not the type of person to care if nudity is involved or not in a movie. I really could hardly care because if I wanted porn, I have the internet for that. The thing to take away from anime is usually robots fighting or having five large breasted woman going after some poor young man that we as men dream about being in the situation. But it's a problem. It's because of these tropes that now we don't give knowledge to a wider audience that can accept necessary sex and violence to a story that makes sense and is well done. Especially taking that concept, and placing it into the visually exciting realm of animation. That point goes to this film, 'Perfect Blue.' 'Perfect Blue' is about a pop singer named 'Mima Kirigoe,' who decides to leave to world of being a pop singer to become a acclaimed actress. This leads to a series of bizarre and creepy fan notes, a stalker making a website with eerily creepy posts, and murder. All with the addition of psychological thriller of our female lead questioning if the real her was her 'Pop Singer' self.Let this be the first thing I say about it, this film was brilliant for it's amazing atmosphere and directing. Usually with animated films, they were not often directed very cinematically, adult or children films. Usually with older Disney films they would have this constant use of long shots and medium shots. There weren't that many that focused on their lighting and cinematography. I think it really started to change when you saw 'Anastasia' for the first time how much of a movie it felt. It felt compelling with it's characters feeling less like cartoon mascots and more like real actors. It's impressive. One could argue that if you want an animated film to be more like a live action film, why not film it like that then? That was the big complaint from a lot of critics that saw 'Perfect Blue.' The purpose of animation, that people see as, is this stereotype that because it's animated, it has to be crazy, wild, bodies have to stretch, or at the very least, there has to be some form of fantasy or science fiction. But with this film, there's nothing like that in it. Other than Mima's ghostly figure she creates in her mind, there isn't a lot of visual elements that would almost force into the direction of having it be animated. So the question being, why not just film it instead? Why did it have to be animated? My answer, ""Why not?"" I mean, there is so much of untapped potential in this world of animation it's baffling. This movie reflects that great atmosphere I've found in most Hitchcock thrillers, but it just happens to be a cartoon. I mean, yes, it's Japanese animation so it looks a bit cheaply done. The big critique I have of this movie is when you finally meet the stalker in the film, the English dub voice actor, I think was a bad choice. His voice almost seemed comical looking back at it. Which sucks because otherwise I was totally compelled into the film, and even after he's gone from the film, you do get immediately sucked back into it. It was just the only thing to put me out of the film, other wise, the writing was interesting and the editing was pitch perfect. But the real show stealer that really makes the film, is that cinematography. The uses of lighting and shading as if you were directing a live action drama, being applied to a animated film. It's astounding to look at visually.Overall, it's amazing to see how much seriousness and suspenseful tones were added to a film of animation. My hope is to see more films like it in the future. Again, the stalker's voice chosen in the English dub kind of put me out of the tone, but otherwise, it's damn near perfect. What's best is, again, after the stalker's gone, it puts you back into it. That's great considering there's so many movies out there who have a third act curse where after the third act hits suddenly it ruins the rest of the film, but in this case, after he's gone, it picks you back up and into the feature, so I got to give it props for that. The ending was complete, and it felt overall a satisfying film. It's an animated treat that is best not to be shown to children. It's an adult feature. A mature one. One that I feel should be the one used as a frontier to having cartoonists see that they don't have to be comical to tell a story in art. That what really matters is a good story with strong visualization that can hold audiences attention, without it be obnoxious. If anything, this film, highly underrated."
"I would first like to start off with the animation of ""Perfect Blue"". I really enjoyed it because it had that 'classic' feel to it. Like most animes made in the late 80's to 90's. The artwork wasn't horrid but is also wasn't over the top. Especially when the term pop-star is mentioned. If it was more modern. Then prepare for the overuse of stars and sparkles and pink. Lots and lots of pink, but it didn't have that. It was down to earth and i liked that about it a lot. Moving on, when the movie began I kind of drifted in and out because progress was moving so slow, but i was anxious to see what the obviously creepy, fish-eyed, gap toothed man in the crowd was going to do. I mean seriously. Who kept allowing that guy to attend all of Mima's shoots? Is there no security? But anyway, the guy was obviously a stalker and like most stalker films, I was expecting this guy to do what any other stalker would do. Run her life into the ground. But no PLOT TWIST. These tend to come out of nowhere in Perfect Blue. First we get the impression that Mima's going insane. Which is understandable considering what she's going through. But then the same hallucination that's tormenting Mima is floating around the obsessed fan and it made me think ""How is that possible?"" Soon I could no longer tell the difference between what was real and what was in Mima's head. Despite her obvious personality change no one gives two sh*ts. Mima basically walks around like a soulless doll and all they care about is the dumb movie.But enough of that. The ending is what got to me the most. Never would i have expected for the manager lady to be behind all of it. She was seriously the very last person I suspected. She showed no signs of being a psycho and was the only one who truly cared about Mima. Here I am waiting for the fish eyed dude to show up in Mima's apartment when she wakes up, but instead I get the total opposite. Disregarding the slow progress of the story in the beginning and the slight confusion, it was awesome and i recommend it. :) It keeps you guessing, on your toes and leave you in utter shock."
"Many people think that this movie is a masterpiece. I will not say that this movie should be in a TOP of the whole story, but it's really VERY good, is the kind of movie which at the end all makes sense and you'll wish to watch it again to see now all the details and even again. It's the kind of movie which apparently there is confusion, but it's Not a cheap device to awe the public, really only is a apparent chaos and behind really there is a order, of a well-defined plot which clearly happens in front of your eyes and you don't realize it until the end.I'm also surprised because there are many people who think the contrary, that it is an ""overrated and confusing movie"", and that has motivated me to write this review. So I will just describe the synopsis anterior to the psychological thriller. But if you want to read spoilers and understand some things, you can read my comments in its board.I also noticed a bias against the Japanese cartoon. This movie could have been a live-action. In fact, apparently it would be a live-action before the change of plans due the budget. But that didn't change or harm the product.>>>  The movie is starring by ""Mima"" that (somehow) really is more of one character.""Mima Kirigoe"" is a girl whose dream is to be a singer with her friends, and she's the lead singer of a inconspicuous group J-pop relatively successful. She impress everyone and everyone knows that she is the most charismatic, the most talented and most promising. So, could she take a step further and transcend?. In that moment of glory, Mima finds she has a website fan about her, called ""Mima's Room"" owned by someone called ""The Real Mima"" supplanting her identity. That someone seems watch her all the time because knows every move and tastes of her; but even it's fun and flattering to Mima.But her group (seemingly) soon will reach its peak, so one day comes the ""great deal"" to Mima. She should choose, and due to the offer of a faster rise to fame she chooses and betrays her dreams, her friends, her audience, even herself and her dignity. She is unhappy doing that turning point in her career; but (because of the offer, due not fail to her Team, and her desire to stay in) she convinces herself that ""it's what she wants"". At that moment ""The Real Mima"" no longer speaks just about her routine, but about the Mima's truly feels and thoughts. No one else could know what Mima think and feel, except Mima, and ironically ""Mima Kirigoe"" at that time is self lying pretending loves her new way. Who is ""The Real Mima""?.Unfortunately the situations only goes from bad to worse and the result she get is just the opposite of what she expected and she is falling ever more; Mima is dissociated so she self convinces that ""everything is going well"" and ""is happening what she want"" and ""she's happier than ever"", justifying everything in interviews, disqualifying negative reviews, and happy reaffirming her way with more ""hardcore turning point"". At this time ""The Real Mima"" warns that she has been replaced by an impostor who is dirtying her image and making a fool with her name. Everything goes wrong for Mima; far from her family, with the non-acceptance of her fans, having lost what she had before to get less, her (ex)friends are now really successful and most famous -and grow up-, and now having hallucinations of a ""Ghost Mima"" from her past who mocks her, while a wave of murders that ""coincidentally"" matches those who have ruined Mima. Mima is about to lose her mind, if she has not already lost it and she's the villain now?. The whole world seems to be against Mima and her only remains support is her maternal promoter/manager. Then the psychological thriller begins...  >>>The movie is a representation of our evolution in the life due to changes and new decisions; evolution which never is an easy road and sometimes quite struggled and depressing, what makes our reality exceed us, and our reactions aren't the best due our immaturity and really not understanding our own reality. Even, also a naked review about how ""The Industry"" uses, perverts and discards people; how make ""adult stars"" following a stereotyped moves and ""career boost"" until the toy gone bad (and is replaced). Even it's prophetic compared with the typical story of many Disney girls & like. But it's just a context for the psychological thriller plot.It's a movie in which we can identify with, all those who have had those moments in life, and our reactions are usually the same: OR the present overwhelms us and we want to return to the past OR the present overwhelms us and we believe understand it and ""we're better than ever"". However our mind works slow and always we understand our reality up to 5 or 10 years late, and always when we look back we better understand what happened to us, what we did wrong and what we should do, and so we feel that ""we mature""... and so feels that ""now we're doing all right"", again. Possibly, you cannot appreciate this movie if you're too young or if you have not been through this kind of thing.Possibly, there are two versions (R and not R). I recommend the full version (R) because it contains necessary parts for the plot and the explicit scenes aren't free (and I don't say this very often). Also you're not a child, and if you're a child then this movie will bored you, you better watch Transformers (No offense, I love Transformers too)."
"A visceral and mind-bending experience, ""Perfect Blue"" reminded me why I love anime in the first place. It constantly toys with the thin line between fantasy and reality in exciting and clever ways that later surrealist films such as ""Black Swan"" and ""Inland Empire"" would also attempt to emulate. Of course, nothing beats the original.The protagonist, a singer-turned actress named Mima continually experiences illusions that essentially drive her crazy. Some of these illusions involve death, showcasing her killing people close to her, such as her co-stars and others involved in the film she's making. Mima also seems at first to be stalked by a deformed looking man, who is seen from the very beginning of the film when Mima and her singing group have their last concert performance. After that, he's seen everywhere. Mima can't get him out of her mind even when he's clearly not physically next to her.Other illusions show her being harassed by what at first seems like her alter-ego, a ghostly figure who keeps taunting Mima and basically breaking down her spirit. This figure looks the same as Mima, except without the emotional baggage that Mima herself carries, and she shows up constantly throughout the film in Mima's head. One brilliant scene that really had my brain spinning for a second is when the male stalker is seen typing on a computer, I'm guessing a letter for Mima, and right alongside him is the ghostly Mima figure talking in his ear. The stalker had this voice in his head telling him that Mima wants him, basically, and that's what that scene seems to hint at. This goes hand-in-hand with real life incidents of celebrity stalking, specifically of actresses. A lot of actresses put themselves out there for everyone to see, and as they're objectified by the industry, most guys who otherwise wouldn't give a damn fawn all over them. The media has a powerful effect on the human mind.Now, the scene that really gets me is when Mima supposedly kills the stalker, because throughout the middle portion of the film, she's shown having all these various dreams and illusions, all of which are at first presented as being real. Every time I thought one was real, I was brought back to reality by Mima waking up or something similar. Mima killing the stalker seemed to be just another vision, and the reason she was having all those visions of a deformed male stalking her is because she's always harbored negative feelings about males and is in reality insecure around most of them. This is further exemplified by the scene in which Mima is filming a rape scene for her movie that looks vividly real, and she begins panicking for real (or just acting really, REALLY well), and gets drowsy in the process to the point of nearly fainting. Her illusions and paranoia make her a more believable actress in the long run, to the point where the director and others around her start to get creeped out, or simply suspicious. Males are presented as killers in the media extremely often, and that combined with Mima's insecurities about males (something bad may have happened to her as a child, having to do with a male) is the primary why Mima imagines a creepy looking male going around doing all these various killings. She couldn't be more wrong when it's revealed at the end of the film that her stalker is in fact an obese female, which leads to one hell of an intense finale.The way the entire film played with my head and had me constantly thinking of possible answers is something I haven't experienced viewing an anime since I sat down and watched ""Paranoia Agent"", coincidentally by the same director.The way the story is told is superb, and I'm normally not even the biggest fan of surrealism, but there's something about the way it's used in this film that made me love it.There are also some truly unforgettable images scattered throughout the film, such as the amusing opening shot which spoofs the Power Rangers, the shot of a dead man in an elevator with his eyes gouged out and blood all over him, a grotesque shot of a man getting stabbed literally in the balls with a screwdriver, and several others. It's just one hell of a film. The animation is very much apart of its time, yet has a timeless appeal and a distinct charm that a lot of the animation of today severely lacks. Helps that it was handrawn.""Perfect Blue"" is one of the defining classics of Japanese animation, and if you enjoyed it on even a basic level, I definitely recommend checking out some of the director's other work, as it's also great."
"An eerie and distressing psychological thriller that is as scary as it is actually confusing in the end. It's a Hitchockian showcase, where reality merges with fiction, just to create an astonishingly complex cat-and-mouse game, with proper amounts of blood and gore surrounding it the whole time.When a young, sweet, retired pop-star, beloved by many die-hard fans, tries her luck in the filmmaking industry - sullying her own good name with atrocious TV-show roles and nude photo sessions - the past eventually comes back to haunt her in the most expressive and frightening way possible - through confounding distortions of reality and many deceptive visions. There isn't a sense of tranquility - even though the main character might aspire to achieve it - as the audience isn't sure who is who in this surrealistic expression of a celebrity's worst nightmare.Perfect Blue plays some both astounding and discomforting visual tricks on the viewer's mind, dragging one deeper and deeper into the whole frightful intrigue. Although Perfect Blue goes too far and makes the whole storyline a bit overdone - slightly weakening the final effect - it still is a mesmerizing anime that might haunt with its strong attention to mind-boggling imagery and shocking scenes of animated violence."
"Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller by Satoshi Kon. It's basically from where the film The Black-Swan took all it's main ideas. It's about a young singer who tries to change her career to become a actress instead. But quickly the main character stars to lose her grip on reality and what's imagination and reality begins to blur. It was an innovative anime film for several reasons: I think it is the first major animated psychological thriller. It clearly shows that animation is a medium as flexible asOverall, a highly enjoyable film. I found it significantly more interesting than the last three films I reviewed. It was the only one to keep me at the edge of my seat out of the four films. However, the ending wasn't as good as the rest of the film and felt a little forced."
"I always found the fundamental problem with admiration of celebrities as well as the concept of fame itself is that we tend to fail to see them for who they really are as a person. Which is why I can never really say that I know that person, sure I might see them on the silver screen or an interview or two but I've never shared dinner with them nor hung out, so I honestly don't really know them.Perfect Blue is I feel one of the best if forgotten anime. This film was the late great Satoshi Kon's debut in the anime world and it's a great start for him, this film is a beautifully crafted thriller that plays out almost like a Hichcock thriller, in those thrillers it's always about a innocent person's world turned against him/her and they become isolated with no one they can really trust to help them.The animation in this film is great to me it's one of animes best examples because it was doing something that anime still isn't doing much of or wrongfully steering aways from which is realism and unconventionality. One of the things I love about Satoshi Kons work is he's always doing something different every time and avoids all of those anime cliché's like explosions, mecha and all the other familiar goodies I've seen one time too many, this film has none of those things here he's playing things straight out no gimmicks. Also the style and direction of this anime doesn't even feel like an anime at all but actually felt like I was watching a live action more, and it's all because of the films sense of realism, that's pretty trippy but that's the point. The music is great I like the pop songs but I mainly like the eerie dark tune we hear, which really sends chills down your spine.Satoshi's trademark has been utilizing the technique of blurring reality and fantasy together, much like with Gilliam's ""Brazil"" or ""Jacob's Ladder"". We're literally in the main character's perspective, at time it feels like were seeing reality but then it pulls the rug from under us and we then rethink about our earlier perception. Like for example that TV show Mimi is in, the case their working on is very ironic to the situation Mimi is in, in those scenes at time I couldn't help but wonder if the show wasn't actually a show but that was the reality and Mimi's acting career is the illusion. There are many other moments that can really mess with you but I wont' give them away you have to experience it yourself. Thsi makes the film all the more intense especially that revolving subplot which adds to the atmosphere with the crazed fan whom conducts a rather creep website called ""Mimi's Room"" which is a site that gives away details of her everyday life, some actually ring true to Mimi's psyche. In a way this really hits home because this is a real issue and fear that most celebrates have where there are those fans who's elevator's really don't go all the way to the top and they take it way too far; these are people that live ""As if"" lifestyles where they feel there lives are so empty they have to disconnect with reality and make it based on admiration of something else in order to fill that hole, these kinds of fans creep the hell out of me.The film those is also a character drama where we see Mimi and can't help but feel a sense of pathos for her. The whole film is mainly about identity and the subconscious fear of losing it as one changes. Mimi we see is a young, sweet, naive, vibrant person who as we see like any player in the entertainment game desires to go further and become a big name. But as we see further in the film things aren't going the way she wants them to, like the fact that she has to do things she doesn't want to do or ever is limited to others, this is a common things with all actors and actresses there are highs but there are also lows that can severely hurt, times like that really make me a little concerned for them and wonder if their really alright but also actors and actresses out of the lime light. We even see at times whether she wants to admit it or not that the band she's broken up with she actually does miss it when she sees when she's separated they've became more popular than before as well as her friendship with the two, this makes her wonder if being an actress is what she really wanted at all or was she deluding herself to run away from who she really is. With these factors as well as the subplot involved she begins to feel the pressure and fall into a spiral state of despair and depression where she begins to lose her sense of self and nothing feels real.Illusions can't hurt you but reality can kill you if you can't decipher the difference between the two and yourself.Rating: 4 stars"
"Perfect Blue has seen a resurgence of interest after the recent success of Darren Aronofsky's similar Black Swan and many film-goers note that the latter was clearly influenced by the former, and it really does come across when one compares the films: they both center around an art (acting vs. dancing) and a paranoid, attractive and driven woman who gradually descends into paranoid delusions because of her obsessive commitment to the art form, in Perfect Blue an aspiring actress, in Black Swan a ballerina. Both films are wonderful and each hold up very well on their own, however I would say that the similarities between the two films are probably mostly superficial and don't really extend beyond the blurring of reality and fantasy theme and the doppelganger ""who's who?"" element. I'd also say that Black Swan was more emotionally wrenching than Perfect Blue.I saw Perfect Blue recently and I enjoyed the film. It's very engrossing and the animation is superb. It's the type of film you'd have if you mixed Roman Polanski, Hitchcock and some Lynch and then teamed it up with Disney. The film particularly recalls the paranoid work of Polanski (Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, The Tenant) and the dream-like, surreal state of many of Lynch's films (Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire). Perfect Blue, despite being influenced by probably superior and more sophisticated works, is a very innovative work that succeeds extremely well as its own piece. I highly recommend it to those whom enjoy a good psychological thriller."
"Well where to start. This movie is an all time favorite of mine. It has both the feeling of fear and being scared. Most people think that to be scared you have to show gore. Perfect Blue that the real fear is losing the sense of reality and fantasy, losing control is what we all fear and this movie shows it. Granted the gore in this movie is there but its done with style. Perfect Blue is one big emotional Roller Coaster ride of fear. When i first seen this movie I was guessing left and right on who the killer was and in the end of the film i was floored when i seen who was the killer. The visual appealing to the movie is fantastic, In one scene where mima's pop idol starts talking to her you can see the that the ""Pop idol"" was clean, pretty, and brighter, where as mima was had a dark color tone which represented what she did, posing nude, doing a rape scene. What i like about it too that this movie is that is shows how fans the react to mima doing something different or extreme. Mima's followers says that she was changing and they weren't fond of it. This shows that real people do that as well. This movie does show ""Art Imitating Life"" because we all criticize someone who radically changes there personality or the way they act or dress.Over all if you want to watch a great scary thriller, I recommend this anime movie to anyone, even the ones who don't watch anime. As far as thrillers, on my list, it doesn't beat my all time favorite thriller Silence of the Lambs but it does beat out the first Saw movie."
"I am a fan of anime and of animation, and I was very taken with Perfect Blue. I would have liked it to have lasted longer perhaps, that way more care could have gone into the ending which felt rather weak and rushed. But as a debut of a talented and interesting director, it is a fine anime not just of its genre but overall too.The animation is very good, while the backgrounds flow well and are wonderfully ethereal, the colours are well shaded and the characters look great without being too generic, it is the clever visual flourishes that really elevate. Another strong asset is the story, it is well paced but also in its tone it is wonderfully surrealistic and its ideas are interestingly presented.The music is fine too with some moments of beauty and some of it haunted me as well. The dialogue convinces and the pace is well-judged. All the characters are likable and interesting too, and the voice work is stellar. Overall, a fine film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"Satoshi Kon, the genius animator behind incredible anime works as ""Tokyo Godfathers"" ""Paprika"" ""Millenium Actress"" and ""Paranoia Agent"" created a very own and unique style with ""Perfect Blue"", his first film, in which he he combines a realistic style of animation (At least compared with other anime movies and shows) with a surreal and dream-like plot, filled with mystery and unpredictable (But quite convincing) twists and revelations. Many people compared ""Perfect Blue"" with the works of the director of David Lynch. It is true that this movie shares some of the aspects of Lynch movies (Like the dreams within a dream) but i would say that it also had elements of the first films of Dario Argento and some of the works of Takashi Miike (Specially Audition) Despite being a pretty dark and disturbing film, it also has some bits of humor and sarcasm, something pretty common in the following works of Satoshi Kon. (Specially paranoia Agent, another of his masterpieces)""Perfect Blue"" is an excellent thriller, and it is much better than many live action thriller that I've saw. I would recommend this movie not only to the fans of Japanese animation, but also, for those who love (good) mystery and psychological horror."
"First of all, this movie will confuse you and it will make you think, it might even screw with your mind because the plot isn't exactly simple or easy. Those that say that got it all figured out ever since the beginning are lying. This is a psychological thriller that knows how to make use of suspense and how to mix reality and fantasy to the point of confusing the viewer while developing a complex and concise plot. It's really a murder mystery filled with twists that will throw some fake hints at you, with a great direction and very powerful scenes that contribute to the nature of this movie. This movie is for adults, seriously, we are dealing with nudity, a rape scene, explicit violence, gore and a very complex plot, so please... take that into consideration.Overall I really enjoyed this movie, it's a suspense and mystery ride with a very intelligent plot and an ending that while it will make you initially think that the whole thing didn't make any sense, if you think carefully about all the little details everything ends up making perfect sense. It's one of those movies that might require a second viewing. Doesn't get a perfect 10 from me because in spite of being original and a masterpiece in the anime media, out of it, it's nothing new."
"I'm not much of a man for Manga or Anime to be honest. I've only seen about half a dozen or so films, and while I have liked what I watched, I generally don't go seeking for titles as I would with other genres. But saying that, if I were the kind of man to make a top 100 list of all time, including all genres, I'm pretty sure Perfect Blue would be on there somewhere, and quite possibly in a decent enough position.Perfect Blue follows the disturbing path that young Mima's life takes after she announces that she is retiring from pop band life to pursue a career in acting. One of her managers feels it's the best idea for her, but the other, Rumi, a former pop idol herself, thinks it is career suicide. Despite all, Mima lands herself a small yet harrowing part on a TV drama. At the same time, a website starts up called ""Mima's room"", purporting to be written by Mima herself. Whoever is writing the online diary sure does know a lot about her life, and it isn't long that this stalker starts threatening those around her. It doesn't take long for threats to materialize into murder, and for Mima's sanity to take a backseat...What unfolds is both genuinely disturbing and sad. Mima is asked to act out a rape scene for the show, and it is a hard scene to watch. The innocence of Mima's past life crumbles away as everyone wants a piece of her, and none seem too concerned about it's affect on her young mind. She begins to confuse dreams with reality, and the past with the present. Is her personality really splitting, and is she somehow involved in the murders? I've said too much already! The first few minutes of Perfect Blue feel pretty much like anything you would expect a teenybopper anime to be. Lots of pop music, screaming teenage girls, and tough looking boys. But this all melts away pretty quickly after the title sequence, luring you in with an easy charm. There are very few punches pulled here. The murder sequences are short, but pretty damned brutal. The killer likes to stab the victims in the face with a screwdriver, and occasionally in the groinal area too. The rape scenes and other exploitative nudity scenes are just what you would expect from the nation of folks who eat rapes for breakfast; they are kinda uncomfortable.What works so well is how the film is realized. I'm not sure if it would be as great as a live action film, but apparently there is one already made in Japan. The fluid camera positions coupled with the colour tones are flawless. For me, the film feels like a messed up blend of Argento's Tenebrae crossed with Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. Ya think I'm talking outta my hairy flossy? Just check out the scene Aronofsky borrowed for Requiem. You will know it when ya see it. He even owns the rights to this film, apparently.Perfect Blue is stylish, dark and disturbing, but flows brilliantly and without any hiccups. This is one little flick you will want to watch more than once. Check it out, but don't watch the dubbed version!"
"Could this be the best full length anime movie ever? Possibly. This psychological thriller is very deep, very intriguing and most importantly, very entertaining.I'm sure you've already read the plot if you're reading this review. Mima is a pop idol with a clean image who decides to become an actress with a not so clean image. She is being stalked by an obsessed fan and also is seeing her past form. What is real? What isn't? Is Mima sane? Is she psychologically screwed? What the hell is going on? These are just few of the questions that'll pass through your mind while watching the movie. Everything is executed beautifully. There are also quite a few disturbing scenes in the film which just add to the beauty of the film. When you're done watching the movie, you'll be questioning reality and illusion yourself.The only things I found negative were the somewhat overuse of nudity and the ending being a bit confusing. However, this is not a movie to be missed, whether you like psychological thrillers or anime or both. Highly recommended."
