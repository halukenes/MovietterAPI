"""Shaun of the Dead"" is not only the best zombie flick I've seen in a long time, it is simply the best film I've seen in a long time, PERIOD! Clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific, SOTD has it all. Of course, I didn't think I could go very far wrong with a film that George Romero himself said he enjoyed.Shaun (Simon Pegg) isn't having a very good week. His co-workers have no respect for him, his uptight stepfather is on his back and his beloved girlfriend Liz has had enough of his laziness and inconsideration. Really, Shaun isn't such a bad guy, but he has no ambition and seems to prefer the company of his unemployed, flatulent, video-game obsessed slob of a flatmate Ed to anyone else. And as if this were not enough, the dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. Shaun doesn't notice this fact as quick as he should, but Shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself, lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of Britain. Not even news flashes can get through to Shaun, as (in an incredibly hysterical scene) he channel surfs rapidly, every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious Shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world. When Shaun and Ed finally do realize what is happening, it quickly becomes a race against time: save Shaun's mum, rescue Liz and go to the pub where they can wait out the zombie infestation with a pint and a smoke. Of course, not everything goes as smoothly as planned. There's undead flatmates to deal with, ""bitey"" zombies along the way, petty arguments between friends and Ed's cell phone going off at inopportune moments. But Shaun, armed with a cricket bat, is determined to save the woman he loves and nothing is going to get in his way!This film should be seen side by side with Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" as both films cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombified society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead. There's not much gore here, but there is one very unexpected and Savini-worthy moment in ""Shaun"" when the zombies rip a living man to shreds, yanking out intestines and tearing off limbs. I really hadn't seen such a gory scene coming and was too stunned to look away. It's truly graphic and nauseating...and, though I usually hate gore, very well done. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in ""Shaun."" There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean stepdad. Shaun himself is forced to grow up and take charge as the zombies close in around them. I don't want to give away the incredible ending of ""Shaun"" except to say that the living dead are not immune from pop-culture commercialization, and though loved ones may die, video games are forever. SEE THIS FILM!!! You do NOT have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is ""Shaun of the Dead."" I haven't seen a movie this good for a very long time. 10 stars."
"Shaun of the Dead is quite a surprising and brilliant piece of work which I suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status as word of mouth snowballs this film to richly deserved recognition.Simon Pegg, both the joint writer and the main star of the film, has been a comedic force for some time, most notably in the fantastic BBC2 series 'Hippies' (which inexplicably bombed in the ratings) and the cult Channel 4 series 'Spaced'.  Both programs hinted at Pegg's saliently dead pan comedic manner (and writing skills) which comes to full fruition in 'Shaun of the Dead'.In a nut shell, this film is a romantic comedy with zombies (or zom-rom-com) who appear for no good clear reason (although some tantalizing clues are offered).  The film is an amazing blend of the funny, the violent and the poignant.Pegg has cast himself as one hell of a serious loser in this film.  And not in the 'American' form of: 'I am a loser but I work in TV and have Jennifer Aniston as my wife'  kind of loser as portrayed in tripe such as 'Bruce Almighty' or dozens of other US 'loser' films.  Pegg's Shaun is a genuine loser and extremely recognisable too, he's an everyday man who works for an electrical retailer and his life is just plain dull and disappointing - and this is where all the comedy comes from in this film.  There are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this (and also shine a light of Simon Pegg as a very clever and funny writer) and both scenes simply involve Shaun walking to the nearby corner shop.  The first time Shaun plods semi-comatose to the store we simply get the feeling that he is a loser.  However, by the time the film shows him making the same journey again we realise that there is a lot more going on!  The scene is played with such exquisite subtleness that it has to be one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any film! Not that this film is subtle however, there is a stunning array of visual comedy, one liners and (best of all) some digs at other films from the horror genre. The funniest being a very subtle snipe at Boyles `28 days later' - see if you can spot it!The only problem with reviewing this film is that there are so many funny moments in it that it is hard to pick any to write about without spoiling the film.  All I can say is that I cannot remember a film ever being this consistently funny with probably five or six serious laugh-out-loud moments. It was a joy to watch and my only disappointment is that I can never watch this film for the first time ever again - every viewing will forever be a repeat viewing.Shaun of the Dead is not very everyone though - the language from the beginning is strong and the violence was quite surprising for a 15 certificate film (in the UK). This film is definitely going to be most appreciated by horror fans who know a huge back catalogue of horror films. It will also be enjoyed by teenagers (who filled the cinema when I viewed this film which was terrific, as they laughed loudest).  Finally, I do have some criticism of this film and that is there is some wasted talent in the movie.  Black Book's (channel four) star Dylan Moran seemed a bit wasted and so was Martin Freeman (from BBC2's The Office) - who would have made a terrific zombie!  Also, did I spot Matt Lucas (from BBC3's 'Little Britain') in this film? I am not sure as I was laughing too hard maybe!
These problems however are so minor and can easily be forgiven.  My suggestion is to go and slowly shuffle down to your local cinema to see this film and give Simon Pegg the money and recognition he deserves so that he can go on and make more films that are this good including what the UK papers have suggested as his next project - `From Dusk 'Till Shaun'."
"Shaun Of The Dead isn't your typical zombie movie. In fact, the zombies don't truly enter the story until almost a third of the way in. So what's it really about? A man named Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, who lives in London and is a bit of a loser. He works in a dead-end job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate, Ed. One day Shaun's girlfriend, Liz, decides she's had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him. When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz, so he sets out to save the day, win his girlfriend back and keep his mum, Barbara, from being eaten by his step-dad who's slowly turning into a zombie.Don't let the title and premise fool you, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead, it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the undead. The film is also very clever, with a clear social commentary running throughout. The jokes that stem from this are absolutely hilarious but will probably be lost on any non-Londoners. It's actually quite unlikely that this film will translate to anyone outside the UK and this is a real shame and perhaps the films biggest flaw. But if you do get it, then good for you, because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here. The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as when Shaun and Ed are looking through Shaun's LP collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies, ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"", or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The humour comes thick and fast, never have I laughed so consistantly during any film before, it only pauses briefly for a few dramatic scenes, all of which work surprisingly well. In fact the film tends to genre-hop quite a lot, and while some find this unappealing I think it works in its favour. One minute it's a comedy, then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror. In fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent. One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed, but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you. That's the thing about this movie though, you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. Can I explain it? Well, no. You'll just know if the film's for you when you see it. I can assure you that most will like it. If you don't, then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill . Ok, that wasn't long ago, but before that I don't think there was a film that was so rip-roaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time. There is nothing subtle about this movie, and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people. I urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it. It's not without its faults though, losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits roll.Shaun Of The Dead is a great film. It's funny, it's clever and it's got zombies in it! Just when the British film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve. Go watch it, you'll laugh till it hurts!"
"Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B-class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this quintessentially British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) to realise anything's wrong is priceless. Director Edgar Wright, who co-wrote the film with Pegg, also demonstrates that there's little difference between glassy eyed commuters and their undead brethren.The plot rips along beautifully and parodies both the romantic comedy and zombie genres, while at the same time remaining true to them. Hopefully a new genre, the romzom com, has been born  incidentally, that's where you can go to find out more about the movie  romzom.com. The fabulous supporting cast includes Bill Nighy (Love Actually) as Shaun's supercilious stepfather, Penelope Wilton (Calendar Girls) as Shaun's absent-minded mum, Dylan Moran (Black Books) as Liz's snooty housemate David and Lucy Davis (The Office) as wannabe actress Diane.Shaun of the Dead was partially inspired by the classic zombie flick, Dawn of the Dead. Its creator George Romero was reportedly so impressed with Shaun of the Dead that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are taking on cameo roles in Romero's latest instalment, Land of the Dead.Shaun of the Dead is one of the best comedy of 2004 and a must-see for all rom zom com (romantic comedy with zombies) afficionados. ****½/***** stars."
"...He'll kill some zombies too! Brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horror-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""Armed with a cricket bat, razor-sharp wit, and an attitude, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is perhaps the last guy that you'd want to save the world from the legions of the living dead that have suddenly begun to storm the London neighborhood where he lives. It could be stated, as this is a running gag here, that we're all dying slow deaths, so it's no surprise that when zombies begin to eat the flesh of the living, Shaun couldn't be any more oblivious to the chaos that has gripped most of London.Shaun loves his dead-end existence of wasting his days at the Winchester, a local pub, with his friend and flat mate Ed (Nick Frost). The film's money shot arrives about 20 minutes in, when Shaun, hungover from a hard night's drinking, goes to the store and because he's so hungover and is worried about his ex-girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), he doesn't even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.While in the store buying a beverage, he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.Straight from Britain, we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is fairly light on it (at least for the first 45 minutes) and is dominated by laughs galore.You may remember the character of ""Ash"" (Bruce Campbell of ""Evil Dead"" fame), who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know, Campbell's pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi's notorious film series. So maybe with ""Shaun of the Dead,"" the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg, who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.It's pretty obvious that ""SOTD"" was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero (the director of 1978's supreme epic of zombie action-mayhem ""Dawn of the Dead"") and 2002's ""28 Days Later"" (directed by Danny Boyle). There are little itty-bitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie.Granted ""Shaun of the Dead"" is aimed largely at the gorehounds who idolized Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy, but it's also the first zombie flick to attempt making a hit with the mainstream. I guarantee any viewers out there that you'll spend more time laughing than you will being frightened.10/10"
"Here in the States they don't show too many foreign movies, even if they are from the countries like UK. When they show them, however, they tend to outdo some of the American movies in the box office. Although the British movies are rarely shown here, they're a guaranteed success - do you recall the popularity of the last year's ""28 Days Later""? Well, this movie is even better - it's a hilarious combination of comedy, social parody, tragedy and drama, spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made. Some references are pretty slim, though - for example ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"" is a reference to ""The Night of the Living Dead"" - a reference that many people (including George Romero!) didn't get. Most of the actors are unknown to an average American, yet they played great! I hope that movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" will make big wigs in Hollywood realize that there are many great foreign movies, and that integrity is always better than crude remakes which the States are so notorious for... I encourage everybody to come and see SOTD - the best comedy of 2004."
"Shaun (Simon Pegg) is in the midst of a lousy patch--he hates and is embarrassed about his job, he gets no respect from other employees, one of his roommates is on his case about the other roommate--a slacker friend of Shaun's, his girlfriend is on his case about the fact that all the ever do is hang out at a pub, and he hates his stepfather, who is also on his case about doing something nice for his mum. As if that's not bad enough, suddenly, everyone is turning into a zombie. Shaun must both straighten out his life and fight for it at the same time.Shaun of the Dead is a superb blending of horror and comedy ala An American Werewolf in London (1981), Idle Hands (1999), Frankenhooker (1990), or the Evil Dead films (beginning with the 1981 original, although there is progressively less to more comedy in that series). It manages to successfully both pay homage to and spoof a number of classic zombie films and horror film zombie mythology in general.The film begins firmly in very British comedy/drama territory, with a number of stylistic directorial flourishes that seem like a cross between Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting (1996). The horror material enters gradually, beginning with a couple background gags, then entering Desolation Boulevard territory via another Boyle reference, this time to 28 Days Later (2002) (although that itself was basically a version of The Last Man on Earth (aka L'Ultimo uomo della Terra)(1964), based on Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend). This arrives in the guise of Shaun crossing over to the corner store to buy his morning soda. He doesn't notice the deserted streets or store because he's so hung over from the night before.Before long, our ragtag bunch of heroes is in the midst of a full-fledged zombie apocalypse--of the traditional, slow-moving zombie type. Acknowledging the cultural differences that strict gun laws bring about, they have to use their wits to commit the requisite head busting, enlisting unwanted LPs (after some debate over the merits of each), cricket bats, shovels and other items for the job. Of course it would be easier if any of our heroes were the slightest bit athletic and had any aim, but they get the job done. More or less.Furthering genre-fan fun, director/writer Edgar Wright and co-writer Pegg insert a lot of references to other zombie films--especially when it comes to explaining the source of the ""epidemic"". The ""scientific"" explanations given in Resident Evil (2002), 28 Days Later, all of Romero's Dead films--beginning with Night of the Living Dead (1968)--and possibly even Romero's The Crazies (1973) and then some are all mentioned in the background, but resolutely cut off before they're finished. Part of the reason might be that usually, the explanations were pretty ridiculous, and we didn't really care--we just wanted to get to the cool zombie stuff, such as limbs being torn off, guts being eaten, and brains being blown or smashed out of skulls.Wright and Pegg also insert clever nods to the subtexts of zombie films. Shaun looks and walks like a zombie when he's waking up. We see zombie like office workers, retail workers, and so on. There's also an amusing nod to filmic attempts to study and tame zombies, as well as organized militaristic defenses (both very prominent in 28 Days Later, but present in other films as well). There are interesting, more subtle and original zombie subtexts in Shaun of the Dead, also, such as the ""mirrored"" scene where Shaun and his crew meet up with Yvonne and her crew.As long as you like outrageous comedy, somewhat gory horror, and you don't mind mixing the two, Shaun of the Dead should provide an enjoyable ride. Although it is the most fun when you're very familiar with the source material it is spoofing and referencing, it is still a great comedy-horror film if viewed with fresher eyes, and not so much as a spoof."
"In a London suburbia, Shawn is almost 30 and hasn't really achieved much in his life. He comes home from his mundane job each day, and goes to the same pub (The Winchester) that he always has gone to. He shares his flat with an ex-student friend, and his lifelong slob of a friend. On top of that, his girlfriend has had enough of him. Oh.and the dead have started walking the earth!Hot on the heels of recent remake Dawn of the Dead comes Simon 'Spaced' Pegg's black comedy zombie spoof, in which Shawn must save his friends, mum, and ex-girlfriend from the masses of lumbering dead by, erm, going to the Winchester! Unlike recent zombie-fests, these dead-ites are pretty lame, lumbering monstrosities, much like the ones from the older zombie films. This is used to simple comic effect throughout as the 'heroes' seem to have plenty of time to think about things before being attacked.The film balances the humour excellently with a decent zombie-story, and the array of characters within are not there just for laughs, there are plenty of poignant moments scattered throughout. Issues of family, love, and friendship, along with growing older and accepting responsibility are contained within the script. Much in the way that TV series Spaced managed to play the absurd with the serious, so does this film. It is easy to compare it to a 'big screen Spaced' episode, but that doesn't sell the film enough. It is much more than that, and is the perfect homage to zombie flicks, and social satire too. Watch towards the early stages of the film to see that most of the population could be confused for zombies anyway, and as for the end scenes of the film.well.suffice to say it will keep you laughing right to the end.With a cast pulled from many cult British shows (Dylan Moran from Black Books, Matt Lucas from Little Britain, and nearly everyone from Spaced), and an excellent appearance by Bill `Love Actually' Nighy, there isn't really anything negative I can think of in the film. Even the action is well handled, with enough gore to satisfy any fans of zombie flicks.This is a must see film which showcases Simon Pegg's talents excellently. The only drawback is that if it catapults him to international stardom he may never get around to making that final season of Spaced!!"
"The great British sit-com has undergone something of a revival in recent years. Galvanised by the new wave of smart, sassy imports from the US, the Brits have girded their loins and produced a spate of quality comedies that have banished memories of the bland, identikit dross of the late eighties and early nineties.One such series is Spaced, a wholly original and delightfully quirky comic bagatelle which has built up a small but dedicated following in the UK. Now writer/actor Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright have teamed up once again to give us Shaun of the Dead which is, in a nutshell, a feature-length episode of Spaced (with added zombies). Happily timed to coincide with the Hollywood remake of the 1978 classic shocker Dawn of the Dead, Shaun is the perfect antidote: Irreverent, warm and very funny.Shaun (Pegg) is your stereotypical sit-com loser: An ineffectual slob in a dead-end job, he is terminally afraid of commitment and spends all his time with his flat-mate Ed (Nick Frost, also from Spaced) who is an even bigger loser. After his girlfriend dumps him, Shaun and Ed seek solace in their local pub the Winchester - a good old-fashioned English hostelry with warm beer and pork scratchings which is infamous for its lock-ins. They stagger home in a state of advanced refreshment, unaware that the dead are now walking the earth. Indeed, it takes Shaun a little while to work it out the following morning despite interacting with a few of them (one of the recurring themes is that most of us go through the drudgery of our daily routines in a trance close to inertia).When the penny drops, Shaun resolves to rescue his mother and his (ex) girlfriend and generally stand up for himself for the first time in his life. There is not much more of a plot than that. The film, like Spaced relies on a flawless script, observational humour and the theatre of the absurd. Pegg has perfected this in his writing but he is also a surprisingly good actor. It helps that he has surrounded himself with the pick of the British comedy fraternity who seem to have been lining up (literally in one scene) for a cameo. The stars of similarly acclaimed series' such as Black Books, The Office and Little Britain are all on show here as well as Jessica Stevenson, Pegg's Spaced co-writer, who plays a jolly-hockey-sticks human vigilante with a stiff-upper lip and can-do attitude ready to give those nasty zombie's what-for.Veteran support comes from Penelope Wilton (a sit-com stalwart from a bygone age) as Shaun's curtain-twitching mother and Bill Nighy as her fearsome second husband who performs one of the most dignified and poignant descents into zombieness ever caught on camera.Despite all the high praise, it must be acknowledged that Shaun of the Dead is still a spoof - a comic tool that you could argue is as low a form of wit as sarcasm. But where it scores highly is in its respect for the original material. Most spoofs (the Scary Movie franchise, for example) are vicious lampoons that unmercifully mock the films they are taking off. Shaun of the Dead gently pokes fun but doesn't lose sight of the fact that if something is worth parodying, it must have some merit. Pegg is also careful to ensure that his film can stand up on its own - there is barely a minute goes by without a very good joke and despite the light-heartedness, there are some satisfyingly scary moments and ample gore.What is most encouraging is that us Brits have started playing to our strengths. It took a long time for comedy writers to realise that making an English version of Friends is doomed to failure (in the same way that The Office will not work with an American make-over). We should celebrate the Britishness of this film, laugh knowingly at the in gags, and be proud that it doesn't take a huge budget or movie stars to entertain people at the cinema.8/10"
"This is the best mix of beer and blood I have ever tasted. ""Shaun of the Dead"" has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. Because of this, through its seriousness, the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.Visually the movie is really good looking. Its not like many other British movies and has a good looking use of cinematography and lighting. The gore, make-up and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that I haven't even seen in 'serious' Zombie/horror flicks.You might think that this movie is just mainly a spoof of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) but its really more than that. The movie is good and creates a good story on its own so that it becomes more than just a simple spoof. All of the characters are well written and are funny in their own way.The acting is good for comedy standards and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilarious/funny scene's as well as in serious/emotional one's. Plus of course it has the wonderful Bill Nighy playing a role in it. This guy really is a terrific actor that always is at his best in comical roles like he plays in this movie.Basically this is a very good looking and professionally made movie that also is funny and hilarious at moments. I can't see how anyone could not like this movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Some 5 years before the making of this film the same team behind it wrote and directed series (season) 1 and 2 of an offbeat UK sitcom named ""Spaced"". Massively overlooked at the time of broadcast yet with a hardcore fan base of loyal devotees a third series was long overdue but never did materialise.Shaun of the Dead is the continuation of what went before; of a similar format yet in a completely new setting, with new characters, plus new cast members and for the first time a feature-length run time for the big screen. So how does it play out? Even with such a departure from the original setting, the history of TV to cinema adaptations is a dodgy one to say the least. Fortunately for those of us who already fans or (more likely) if you've never seen the series before prepare to be impressed.The style is all it's own. With inventive direction and editing making the visual impact which fans will instantly recognise, to the writing which importantly is firstly genuinely funny, interspersed with references to popular culture of the past two decades, always with a self-knowing grin, a wink to the viewer rather than a pretentious nod. And of course several self-references and in-jokes of the TV series all fill in the gaps between the tastefully presented killings. There is blood, after all this is a ""rom-zom-com"" or ""romantic zombie comedy"" - a self-proclaimed new genre and rightly so. This is as about as original as it gets. They actually manage to pull off humour, violence, decapitations, action, romance, suspense, sadness and joy all within the space of 90 minutes!This is the best film I've seen in ages, and a real credit to British film, we already knew about ""Fried Gold"", now the rest of the World can see it too. An instant classic."
"Shaun of the dead is in a word, brilliant.I've seen this movie at least 10 times and it never gets old, makes me laugh at each viewing. Having seen Dawn of the Dead, i was expecting just another spoof (as the name implies) but was pleasantly surprised to find a completely original story with some great comedy moments and superb acting all around (not to mention buckets of gore). The first of the rom-com-zom genre, Shaun of the Dead will certainly set the standard for future zombie flicks of its kind, and i can see Pegg having a bright future in comedy. GO RENT IT NOW.Tom Patterson"
"I was really looking forward to enjoying a quirky, English comedy but from start to finish I just could not get into Shaun of the Dead.It should be noted that I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies. The genre has always seemed to focus on gore, effects, and thrills over plot and innovation. But I didn't think this would be an issue since Shaun is a spoof.But it's not a spoof. Or at least not entirely a spoof. Shaun is a conglomeration of spoof, satire, horror, thriller, fantasy, romance, and of course comedy. Very rarely do I enjoy movies that attempt to bridge more than three genres simultaneously. The only similar movie I can recall for comparison is Mars Attacks! (1996).I had some laughs, but overall I could not slip into the proper mindset to enjoy this film even though I desperately wanted to. At times it was clever and creative by placing average Joes in bizarre zombie situations. But at the same time it suffers from all those traits that infuriate and annoy me in horror and thriller movies.In short the primary problem was an inability to empathize with the characters. One reason I don't care for horror movies is because the main characters are generally morons. Shaun himself was no exception; he repeatedly makes poor choices and either under or over reacts to all sorts of situations. His mother is a cross between senile and dim-witted. Ed is borderline retarded.Truthfully, in real life, I can't stand people like Shaun. They are so absorbed in their own problems that they are completely oblivious to their surroundings and events around them. They have no one to blame but themselves for their predicaments. The characters just don't seem to behave realistically, which would be fine if the movie was an outright satire sketch like Monty Python, but it's not.All in all, I give Shaun of the Dead a 6 / 10, still worth a watch."
"Shaun of the Dead is set in London where Shaun (co-writer Simon Pegg) has problems, his fat mate Ed (Nick Frost) is holding him back, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him & then there's the small matter of hordes of flesh eating zombies that risen from the dead to feast on the living. However, Shaun has a plan to save himself, his mate, his ex-girlfriend & his mum & step-dad which involves barricading themselves into his local pub...This British French co-production was co-written & directed by Edgar Wright & I have to say I was left a little disappointed by it & I can't quite see where all the glowing praise for it comes from. The script by star Pegg & Wright is obviously a nice homage to George A. Romero's 'Dead' films although to be honest I'd sooner watch Romero's splatter/gore films than this odd mixture of comedy, romance & horror. Shaun of the Dead is all very British & maybe the novelty of it wins people over especially those who don't live here in Britian, unfortunately I do live here & it just doesn't have quite the same affect on me. Apparently both Pegg & Wright were involved in the British comedy series 'Spaced' which to be honest I've never heard of & maybe that's where a lot of it's fans come from. Anyway, it's a moderately successful film & certainly a watchable one, it's amusing, it's pretty clever & well written, it has plenty of fun references to other films, it's a fairly fun film but I found it to be too spoofy, it goes to far into the direction of silliness & some of the things that happen just annoyed me. I'm in two minds really, I will openly admit it's a fun watch but I didn't think it was as brilliant as many seem to think, I doubt I'd watch it again anytime soon & I didn't have as much fun with it as I'd hoped, overall I'd say I was a little disappointed.Director Wright does a good job, it's shot like a TV soap opera at times although he manages to juggle the comedy, romance & horror quite well. It's not scary & I didn't find it laugh out loud funny either but I'm sure many of you out there do/will. I like the laddish approach that the modern British male would barricade themselves in a pub & wait for it to blow over rather than head for the plush & sensible surroundings of a supermarket as seen in Dawn of the Dead (1978). There's some gore, someone is torn apart at the end, there are someone gunshot wounds to the head but little else worth mentioning.With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 Shaun of the Dead is well made although there isn't a great deal of style or flair to it. The acting is good & the cast make their character's pretty likable.Shaun of the Dead is a decent fun homage to Romero's zombie films, to be brutally honest I'd rather see one of those again than this though. Worth a watch for sure but not as good as I'd hoped & I feel it's slightly overrated."
"Shaun is in his late twenties and works in a electrical store with teenagers.  He hangs out with his slobbish friend and spends every evening in the Winchester pub.  Fed up with this, his girlfriend dumps him, leaving him with the words of his other flatmate ringing in his ears - `sort your life out'.  His plans take an unexpected turn when he and Ed eventually notice that London's populace has mostly given into a virus that turns them into, well, the Z word.  Shaun and Ed devise a plan to keep safe and rescue Shaun's mother and ex.Although the makers were cursing themselves for the unfortunate timing of this film's release with the (much bigger budget) remake of Dawn of the Dead - however for me this served as a rather nice experience after the straight-scares of Dawn.  A point to note for all those moaners, is that this film went into production before the remake did.  Anyway, ignoring this issue it is important to note that the film is a very British affair and is aimed at a very particular sense of humour.  In essence, if you love Spaced then you'll enjoy this.  The film is NOT a spoof - it is a horror movie with laughs, not unlike Evil Dead in that regard.  The gags are good but not as fast as Spaced fans will be used to - instead they are put in with the horror rather than being forced over the top of it.The film has movie references, but not to the point where they become the gags themselves (Spaced's cutaways for example).  In place of that we have references to Deer Hunter and The Matrix that are funny but will not spoil things for you if you don't spot them.  I laughed throughout but it is important not to expect to be rolling in the aisles - the film is still a horror, not a Naked Gun style spoof.As a horror, the film is not really scary but does have a good gutful of gore to go around.  The zombies are slow, and this will not work for modern audiences, but it does hark back to the old zombie flicks and also allows the material to work.  I closed my eyes a few times as the film provided blood, and it does have the odd moment that is touching.  Of course the laughs are everything and, aside from a slow start and a more horror-focused ending, this is consistently funny.The one thing that it also does well is have a slight satirical edge to it. It is delivered rather heavily (early scenes of hooded youths lumbering around force the point home too heavily) but it is still true - having done my shopping in Asda just before seeing this film I can definitely contest that many of us lumber around in a semi-trance!  This is a nice touch - the Dawn remake lacked any of the comment that it's original made, so it is good to have some here.  Again however, non-Brits may not totally pick up on this as we seem to be one of the few countries that has this pub-orientated culture.The cast are great and will be full of faces recognisable from the TV series that this film will draw the majority of it's fans from.  Pegg is great, he is a slightly more advanced version of his Spaced character and he makes for a good leading character simply because he is so recognisable - this is not a Hollywood film with characters we don't know, but instead a bloke from a pub.  Despite the fact that I would hate Ed in real life, Frost is hilariously exaggerated.  He looks very different from Spaced but he does well with the material.  Ashfield is spunky and the only downside to her is that she would never be with Shaun in the first place.  Support is good from Moran, Davis and Nighy.  There are plenty of in-jokes for fans, including a great cameo from Stevenson, who also shows up with her own group of friends that mirror Shaun's friends in terms of looks and (pretty much) TV series background (eg Tim from the Office and Fran from Black Books).Overall this will not please everyone and I fear that some will not laugh as much as the adverts and hype suggested.  However it is a good horror comedy and easily the best British film of the year so far - fans of Spaced will notice the joke rate is scaled back but it is still very funny.  The humour of Spaced has reached the big screen and is doing good things for the British cinema industry.  The makers said they threw so much into the film (horror, comedy, romance, drama, gore) because they didn't think they would be allowed to make another film - I hope to god that is not the case."
"Please tell me cause i can't tell!i can't believe the reviews saying that this was good, cause it wasn't! I really love zombie movies but this is just horrible. The jokes were awful, the situations were obvious and very predictable, and the story itself was really bad and stupid, the end is even worst. i think this is the worst zombie movie i've seen this year. Don't waste your time watching this, and don't let them make you think this is good. Please take my advice, keep yourself away from this thing.by the way i didn't laugh Not even onceAngel Luna"
"OK, I am really not one of these 'the worst movie ever' gang member but this one was really bad, I mean it. I tried so hard to enjoy a little bit but I didn't smile even one time. I don't know how this movie can be rated 8 but first time in my life, I am giving such a confident 1 and if there was a chance to give something lover, I would. From the beginning to the end, it is so slow and the jokes are so bad. If you really want to watch it, fasten your seat belt not to escape screaming and drink one liter of coffee so that you don't sleep. It is not only the plot, the acting was bad as well. I didn't find the characters funny. Overall, bad, bad and plain bad."
"I am completely nonplussed why this torture of a movie seems to be everyone's favorite. On top of that its inclusion in the top 250 is bloody outrageous, not once did I laugh or even crack a smile in this movie. On the other hand I was getting irate by the second watching all of 'em on a nonsensical plot. Simon Pegg was an unexpected nasty surprise in this movie as I did not expect that type of dull performance from the brilliant actor. And the way they handle the situation with his mom is absolutely rubbish.Poor, very poor. Go for zombieland which should take this one's place in the top 250. Oh and BTW so Titanic should be in the 250 too."
"Zombie films are something that many people have tried to make and many people have failed to make well. Even George Romero and Lucio Fulci, it must be admitted, do not have the Midas touch in this genre. This goes ably to show that even when it's a single genre of horror, it's difficult to pin down.Multi-genre combinations are typically even more difficult to accomplish successfully, and unfortunately that's exactly what Shaun of the Dead tries to do. It fails in more or less every way that it possibly can: it's not well-acted, it's not funny, it's not scary, and above all it's really not entertaining or amusing. It's depressing and sad, and the film's end leaves one with a sense of futility and pointlessness, a sense of having wasted the entire running time on a completely and utterly meaningless thing.The whole film is spent with unsympathetic and unlikable clods who manage somehow to survive as long as they do through sheer luck and no real ability or even desire to persevere. The humour is hardly passable, even by today's standards; it's often either crass and unfunny or simply unsubtle and unfunny.The script is as pedestrian as possible, with attempts at tugging the heartstrings merely coming off as manipulative and illogical, especially given the subsequent 'resolution' the film gets. If the viewer is not furious, then he clearly wasn't paying attention. And the scriptwriters certainly weren't paying attention, as the script's coherency is laughable. Even for a comedy, it ought to be much tighter than this happens to be.After people raving about Shaun of the Dead, it's easy to go in either extreme direction. People jump on the bandwagon easily, especially when friends recommend something, and eventually it reaches a point where people who haven't even seen the film are recommending it to others. The overblown nature of the film, however, makes judgement of it much harsher. If it had been simply the small-time film that it probably was intended to be, it might be easier to forgive. However, as an overrated 'cult classic', it is not worth the praise heaped upon it for being something it is not: namely enjoyable."
"Without a doubt ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of the worst comedies (if not the worst) that hit the big screen in 2004. The characters of the film have IQ's all shy of 75. Every single one is borderline retarded. The zombies has more of a mental capacity than those of the living. I did not laugh nor so much as break a smile during this entire film. Anyone who has left a review that has stated that this movie is funny, you have been warned. The entire film takes place in about 2 locations, with very few movements along the way. I wasted over an hour of my life to watch this garbage.Furthermore, I've browsed some of the reviews that have been previously written where some of you say that us ""Americans"" can't understand the ""English"" comedy due to various reasons. Trust me when I say that that isn't the problem here. The problem isn't the dialect, nor the fact that the film boasts primarily English actors. The problem with this movie is that the actors are all C class actors. The problem is that they all lack common sense/intelligence above and beyond the norm. The screenplay is down-right awful and it was just as pathetically acted. Poor acting, poorly written and poorly thought out = an extremely poor film.There is no reason to watch this. You will not laugh, you will not smile. You will waste your time. If you are looking for a good quality horror/comedy film. I suggest you watch ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"". That movie is without a doubt, hands down 10x better than this film here. I have yet to watch Zombieland, but would also be willing to go out on a limb and suggest that that film as well has got to be better.Thanks for reading my review and I certainly hope you take it into consideration."
"Shaun of the Dead (2004)I know that many people will disagree with this opinion, but I really don't care what anyone thinks. This is crap of the highest order but more importantly it is not funny, no it is not funny. NOT FUNNY.A laughable attempt to spoof zombie films (which on average are crap) to produce the apex of modern cinematic trash. I'm sorry but I can't say much else except that Shaun of the Dead is an insult to British comedy and comedy in general.Sadistically boring.1/10"
"The movie starts great, I liked the actors, setting, camera work and the way the apocalypse got teased.
'Shaun Of The Dead' works for a while, but ultimately at one point isn't outstandingly entertaining anymore.
It still sort of is cult for the good parts. Also the ending is alright again after the movie fell off a bit.
I think it's comparable to 'Hot Fuzz' in terms of consistency. Parts of the movie just are great and cult while other parts feel a bit dragging and forced."
"This may sound odd, but what makes this comedy about Londoners fending off zombies with vinyl albums and cricket bats so terribly funny is that it's so utterly believable. Every character is someone you know; every interaction is something you've experienced; every emotion is one you know. Except with flesh-eating zombies.A brilliantly observed comedy, 'Shaun of the Dead' makes shrewd points about the nature of mass media and consumer culture, the banality of everyday life, love, friendship, fear, and heroism. It also pokes fun at traditional zombie movies, with the undead moving so slowly that Shaun and Ed have time to go through their album collection to determine which records are too precious to be slung at their shuffling assailants. The humour is occasionally gross, but always funny; the observations about how real people would react to an entirely surreal situation are spot on.An instant comedy classic."
"Oops! To me this movie was a total disappointment.Perhaps too much British humor that I don't understand but nothing on this movie reflects the current IMDb rating.Very few lines in the movie made me smirk, and no line at all made me laugh.I would not recommend anyone to watch this move, but if you are curious about the rating and if it deserves it or no, it is a 1:30h movie, so be my guest and watch it.The acting was good I might add but that does not add up for the poor plot.Waste of time 3/10"
"Okay, even though I surely don't regret having watched this film, I won't be joining the other reviewers around here who all claim it's a hilarious movie and/or the best horror comedy in decades. The intentions of cast and crew are good, there are plenty of good gags and the characters are likable but overall it feels like something is missing. It sure isn't obvious to mix a splatter-horror subgenre with comical situations so the premise of this 'Shaun of the Dead' doesn't work all the time. Nevertheless, there's enough ingeniousness and originality to make this a worthwhile film. The setting of a grey, banal London suburb with its typical inhabitants suits the story really well and the actors do their absolute best to provide this film with a human character. But it's not as hilarious as it looks and it's simply impossible to uphold a light-headed atmosphere when you're dealing with an apocalyptic theme. In case you're not familiar with the plot: 29-year-old Shaun is stuck in his monotonous life of dead-end job, nagging mother and lowlife roommate. His more ambitious girlfriend breaks up with him and just when he plans to make some serious changes to win her back, a mysterious disease resurrects the dead and turns the living into an endangered species. While the army of ravenous zombies keeps on growing, Shaun rescues his girl and some friends by bringing them to their favorite pub. Some of the gags (like when the gang learns to move like zombies in order to keep a low profile) are really good but the film is a bit too long and the drama eventually overrules the horror. Actually, the very best aspects in 'Shaun of the Dead' are the numerous references towards milestone zombie movies, but I fear these sublime findings are a bit lost on wider audiences. Shaun of the Dead brings homage to the Romero trilogy, The Evil Dead and many Italian classics. For true horror fans, it's a joy to track down all the subtle tributes. Overall, this gem sure is worth renting but the hype in enjoys at the moment is a bit unmerited."
"I wasn't screaming my head off in laughter sad to say. But it was a good smile. It'd probably be better if I'd watch more Dawn of the Dead movies I guess. Overall, this movie is begging for a sequel. It certainly better than 28 Days Later. But I failed to find the massive comedy everyone was talking about. Perhaps it's because it's more like Scream than Evil Dead 2. The latter evil dead movies are very hilarious. So that might have taken some of the punch out. But I liked it. And hope to see more like it. Maybe They'll cure the guys friend out in the shed. :) lol . sorry I don't do playstation....7/10 Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 8/10"
"I guess you could call this a combination of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Snatch,"" the latter used as a comparison because of it's modern-day dark humor, That's what this film is: a combination of irreverent, modern-day attitudes and profanity from young Brits and a re-make of sorts of a famous horror film.Here, we these these 20-ish types fighting a mob of the ""undead"" as zombies roam neighborhoods devouring everyone. Our hero (Simon Pegg), a shiftless bum who has just lost his girlfriend due to his ineptness, winds up being the productive guy who saves the day and gets his girl back. Along the way, we get a number of laughs and a number of gross-out horror scenes, and a lot of f- words and the like. Nick Frost, as Simon''s best friend, provides the best and most disgusting of the low-life characters, which are unfamiliar over here.This is dark humor, to say the least, and would would appeal more to younger people although I like dark humor and I'm an old fart....but others over 50, beware. It was good entertainment in a crude way. My only complaint was trying to understand some of the sentence and British phrases of the day."
"** SPOILERS **Before I start with the review I'd like to make clear that I am a huge fan of anything that has anything to do with zombie films. I see all I can get my hands on, whether they get good or bad reviews and whether I've heard anything about them or not. Shan of the Dead seemed like a cool idea for a movie, at least prior to when I saw the trailer. After seeing the trailer I thought I'd give it a chance anyway. Something not recommended to others, since that's those 99 minutes of your life that you're never going to get back.One of the main problems with this movie is the characters. For good drama you need suitable characters to move the story forward. Shaun of the Dead lacks this vital component. In many instances it's hard to tell what the screenwriter was thinking. The following characters inherit this film: The main character Shaun. He is an ugly loser with nothing going for him. He feels sorry for himself the whole film through all the way to the ending, but it's really his own fault that he is a big loser. Shaun has a friend who lives off him and Shaun's other roommate. This guy is a lazy, fat and disgusting slob with no sense of responsibility whatsoever. I forgot to mention that he deals marijuana as his only way of income. Adorable, isn't it? Shaun's second roommate has a job (!!), a sense of responsibility and seems to know what's right or wrong. Constantly throughout the short period of time that this character still survives, he is being called names behind his back by his ""friends"", and he is the one who dies first.Hold up a second here. Something's wrong. The unsympathetic main characters are morons who nobody can identify with, and the only sensible person in the trio gets killed off quickly. You can't build a movie like this. If you can't identify yourself with the protagonists, you won't care what happens to this and then the movie will not draw you in. I won't bore you with descriptions the rest of the characters, but it's basically the same drill as with the ones I've already mentioned.Another problem with the film is that it's a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It certainly is no romantic comedy, because 1. Let's face it: How romantic are zombies, really? and 2. It's a failed attempt at comedy since very few jokes actually are funny. Maybe the last one is because it's a British sort of humor that I don't 'get'. Anyway, the up until the last 20 minutes, the movie tries to be a comedy, then however it gets 100 percent serious and turns into some sort of splatter-horror-drama. This film is not a good film, and it's one of the worst zombie films I've seen and I've seen some pretty bad ones."
"I am a big fan of what I would still call pulp and others would call pulp fiction. This is because good pulp can say more than pretentious literature or cinema can even aim to say.Shaun of the Dead tells the story Shaun, an ordinary guy who lives life is a dead end, and when his girl friend dumps him his best friend tell him it is not the end of the world. But he is wrong, it is, because the dead have started to walk the earth and feed on the flesh of living.What we get is basically a funny little comedy involving Zombies. On one hand I can argue that pop-horror works because it takes itself seriously and uses humour to cover the lack of budget, so Shaun of the Dead turns horror completely into a comedy missing the point. On the other hand, I don't know any movie that has ever really delved deeply into Zombies (while other unspeakable evils, such as vampires, werewolves and lawyers have all been suitably looked at). So Zombies are always good for a laugh and treating a zombie movie as a comedy makes more sense.That sums up the movie, good for a laugh, never rises above that. It contains over 10 times your daily requirement pop culture references and with the best ending to a Zombie movie that I have seen."
"I watched it today on the insistence of many other zombie film fans that stated it was somehow 'one of the best, if not the best zombie film' and definitely feel cheated during and after watching. Which can only lead me to say, that it's highly overrated.It fell very flat to me and I didn't find it amusing at all, nor special in any way. Not to say it's bad, it's perfectly acceptable - but I certainly didn't think it was worthy of this 'cult classic' label that people give it, and the high rating it has here on IMDb.com and all the talk it gets about it.Honestly, I have no idea why people recommend it the way they do. I get that humor and what people find entertaining is subjective - but I just don't understand the appeal here.There are definitely better zombie genre films, with better stories, and better characters, out there to enjoy compared to this one."
What i can't understand is why this movie is soooo overrated .there is nothing in the movie to laugh at all..there are so lame and childish kind of jokes that i hardly even laugh in the whole movie.This movie is actually a disrespect for all the zombies movies out there.And what an idiotic end to the movie.You would be like .omg what have i just watched!!..even though the genre is comedy but really !!!!! This movie is clearly an insult to zombie film.i mean c'mon even if your making a zombie spoof make it at least tolerable.Save your time and money and watch some real zombie movies like 28 day/weeks later or just watch walking dead rather than watching this. I usually don't write reviews but this movie made me write one.Such a poor comedy and direction.I don't know why people are giving it so much rating !! The movie has such a lousy start and there's nothing till half the time and zombies are such like they would walk like snail i don't even know whats the story in the movie other than zombie which are also poorly made.Even for a comedy movie this movie suck big time!!!
"This truly is one of the worst and most excruciatingly boring movies I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. If this is the ""best of British"" then we are in an even worse state than i thought. I cant believe this is being billed as refreshing and ground breaking comedy.Its about as funny as a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, it follows the trend of so many other brit comedies by going with crass toilet humour. Jokes about farting...my! how original...what a wheeze..i don't think!It was funny 20 years ago but it ain't bloody funny now.I can just picture the hordes of greasy, wacky students rolling in the ailes all over the country.The rest of you should know better."
"everything about this movie annoys me, and i mean everything, especially people's irritating affection for it. it has 'cult' status! well what has happened to the moonies, i ask.its main crime for me is that it isn't funny - the joke is that silly bumbly but really quite lovable Sean finds his very 'normal' life turned upside down when zombies come to town. well there we are, to me that story is worth perhaps five minutes as a sketch or maybe an advert selling spare parts but a full length feature film?!! no.in fact the fact that the story lagged and was predictable and dull wasn't what did it for me. i just cant stand sean penn. he reminds me of jerry lewis in the king of comedy. his portrayal of a charming buffoon is rather like being forced fed chocolate muffins, he is the adult equivalent of a child star, pushing the all the buttons so efficiently but with absolutely no conviction or sincerity."
"Edgar Wright created this masterpiece of a comedy back in 2004, which I still watch today! I'm in love with the characters created not only by Wright but also by Frost and Pegg. I'll never get enough of these two! Brilliant movie!"
"It's time for a serious, level-headed review of Shaun of the Dead.This movie is one of the most over-hyped of the year. I'm tired of everyone calling it an instant cult classic. This phrase doesn't make any sense. A cult classic is a film that no one sees by has a small but loyal following. Shaun of the Dead was a big hit when it was released her back in April and it seems like it will do the same when it's released in America thanks to the alarmingly widespread positive word-of-mouth. Everyone seems to be caught up in the off-centre comedy to realize that the film is heavily conflicted and doesn't add up.First of all, this is not a romzomcom, or whatever. There is no romance, just a guy who wants to make up with his girlfriend while zombies get in the way. And to call it a comedy would be totally wrong, anyone paying the slightest iota of attention would see this film is not a comedy! Some funny moments, yes. But not all the way.Like most other zombie flicks there is no explanation to why Britain is suddenly overrun by the undead. The plague slowly trickles to life from the odd zombie stumbling around to full-blown hoards of them. Amidst this Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (the great Nick Frost) make fun of the undead and go about dealing with the holocaust in their own silly way.There are some pretty hard scenes of heavy emotion is this film (I want say what, but some characters do die) that totally contradict the 'comedy' label it's been stuck with. And despite some scenes of graphic violence this is NOT a horror film. It's not a comedy, a romantic comedy a spoof or homage. It simply doesn't know what it is. Many people believe they got a breath of fresh (or should that be old) air when it was revealed the film would have slow zombies and not the faster ones like in DOTD 2004 and (the dreadful) 28 Days Later. I personally do not understand this overused moan. Slow zombies are not scary; there is no threat from them. Shaun of the Dead starts out very stupid and slow. The opening scenes of people doing the repetitive things day in day out are not subtle at all and hammer the point to the audience way too forcefully. Then when the zombies first appear the characters and the audience don't fully realize/appreciate the danger until the last five minutes when the film finally becomes exciting and then that's when we get REALLY ripped off. The film ends way too quickly and conveniently. What a let down after building up so much only to collapse back into the stupid tone the film began in.Horror buffs will like the zillions of in-jokes and references to other horror movies. To the casual viewer, they will go right over your head. It's about the only thing that's consistent throughout the whole film.Don't listen to the word of over-excited reviewers who are inexplicably giving this film 5 stars. It is in no way the classic they are making it out to be. Good, yes. Entertaining, yes. The best movie you've ever seen/best zombie movie ever/yadda yadda yadda, definitely not. Shaun of the Dead has great potential come from inspiring sources, but the end result is not what the hype is telling you.Already out in UK, the DVD has great 2.35:1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5.1 sound and zillions of extras including Audio commentary from actor/writer Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, Audio commentary from actors Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Dylan Moran, Kate Ashfield and Lucy Davis. Audio commentary from actors Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton, Audio commentary from the zombies!, Extended bits with audio commentary, Outtakes, 'The Man Who Would Be Shaun': Simon Pegg and Nick Frost impersonate Sean Connery and Michael Caine, 'Plotholes': comic strip sequences with voice-over from Lucy Davis, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost including What Happened To Shaun When He Ran Off?/What Happened To Diane When She Left The Winchester?/How Did Ed Get From The Cellar To The Shed?, Extended edits of the TV Shows within the movie: Coldplay on T4 / Fun Dead/Trisha-'Your nine lives are up!'/Trisha-'I married a monster', 'Remembering Z Day': an interview with Jeremy Thompson, 'Electronic Press Kit' featurette, Vignettes: Simon's cam/Lucy's cam/Joe's diary, 'Edgar Wright's and Simon Pegg's Flip Chart': a presentation of the first draft, SFX comparison from Double Negative, Make-up tests, Photo Gallery: photo's by Simon, Lucy and Charlotte, Poster Designs: from the original Oscar poster to the final official poster, 2000AD Strip: 'There's Something About Mary', TV spots, Official trailer, Official teaser trailer, 'Fright Fest' exclusive trailer.Phew! For those with a multi-region DVD player, get the R2 DVD version. Otherwise you'll have to wait until September 24 (my birthday!!!) for the film to be released Nationwide in America."
"This was one of the most awful movies i've ever watched. It's not at all funny even though it's supposed to be a comedy AND it's a crappy horror/zombie movie. Really, I have no idea why this movie has a rating of 8.0 out of 10. Total disappointment.Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B-class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born."
"To see that people really enjoyed this film...Aside from good looking zombies and one well rendered ""day of the dead"" homage gore scene, this movie is really not funny, nor interesting.The humor is meant to be understood and appreciated by our own society's living dead. Easy adolescent wink-wink frat-fart jokes and situations are so abundant in this film, it's just sad to see that people still laugh at that z-grade sitcom crap...The pacing is ridiculous such as the zombies'. They attack whenever the characters have finally completed their lines, and other zombie rules are simply overlooked for the sake of the script's advancement.Imbecile characters for an imbecile audience. Unfortunately this is a winning combo and will sell well to the mass...Makes me sigh in pity when I read that some say it's better in ALL aspects than Peter Jackson's Braindead..."
"I can't believe there are people who actually like this movie. The one's that actually gave this movie a good review, must ""really"" like this kind of humor.This movie is so lame, that I watched nearly the first 10 minutes and I couldn't take it. I waited a few days and tried again. But it is still, the bad movie that it is.This move ""tries"" to be satirical and funny, but instead, it fails at everything possible.No laughs. Not even a sympathy laugh. Even (a great movie) ""Two Can Play At That Game"" was much better than this ""rubbish."" Skip this movie! However, if lame ""supposed"" British humor is your thing, you just might like it."
"I had heard so many good reviews about this movie - 'best British comedy in years' etc etc.So was surprised at how absolutely unfunny and pointless this grueling 100min feature was.  I was constantly squirming in my seat, and not because I was frightened, but because I was desperate to escape this torture I was being subjected to.I think I laughed about three times throughout the film and I didn't hear too many other laughs coming from the rest of the audience.
If this is humor then you can bash me over the head and finish me off like the zombies!Be Warned!"
Not a single laugh... I thought 8/10 movie would be a lot better than this movie...
"As with Hot Fuzz, these directors had the same problem in this earlier production, which most story writers have the hardest battle with: to create a story line with all the strings tied together into a complete movie with a good ending.Although Hot Fuzz turned out to be a real story mess, Shaun of the Dead feels like it is able to stay on track the longer, mainly probably because the story line in a typical zombie movie is so easily predictable to copy.With that said, I can only say that Shaun of the Dead follows the now typical pattern of a great start, with a ""meh"" ending."
This is a fail movie. Too slow. Shaun needed processing time every time someone from his gang got bit. Guess the story writer and director added the so called crying moments to stretch the movie duration to charge us for sitting in the movie theater. 1 star bcz 0 is not allowed.
"What is this? This film cannot possibly be called a comedy; it is barely funny at all; the gore takes over the comedy in every way! I watched this as a DVD on my 15th birthday and kept me terrified for weeks!The plot sucked; just killing zombies and surviving. What crap! It did have its small moments; the walk to the shop by Pegg and the plans to get to the winchester over and over. I still found the worst part was having to see a decent comedian like Dylan Moran being ripped apart, yes it was fake, yes he isn't really dead, but this film is not a comedy. IT SUCKS!!! Edgar Wright is lucky he made Hot Fuzz (a masterpiece), but Shaun of the Dead should be a reminder of how not to make a film! No film can be a horror/comedy, gore removes the jokes, leaving a mass of blood and death! Wright should be ashamed!"
"This is such a forgettable little film that I forgot I ever even saw it until I read the movie's title on IMDb's ""top 250"". So why is this watchable but unfunny comedy/horror movie there? There are several explanations for this strange occurrence.1) The usual explanation: that most movie-goers have zero taste. 2) A bunch of Brits gave it high marks for patriotic reasons. 3) There was a computer or human error in averaging the votes/ratings.The gags are cheap/obvious/predictable, the movie's comedy consisting mainly of a bunch of average actors clowning around. If this movie is supposed to represent the ""British revival"", I don't want to know what would represent its downfall. A far cry from Pegg's later comedies."
"Britain excels at a certain type of comedy. Any time there is comedy to be had in the mundanity, tragedy and petty minutae of everyday life, you can be sure that Britain is the country to handle it. Leave the pratfalling to other people - Britain has honed this particular style of comedy for years.So explain how this film got it so badly wrong? I loved The Office, which this film clearly wants to be - but this film seems to have completely missed the point. It is like a film student trying to make a Tarantino-esquire film and eschewing a good script and hip, funny dialogue (you know - the things Tarantino is actually good at) for a series of slow-motion action sequences set to a retro soundtrack. In short, they have missed the best parts of the comedy style (the awkward glances, the tragi-comedy etc.) for broad,""safe"" humour. And it doesn't work.But, people tell me - isn't it great to have a Zombie film that pokes fun at the genre. Isn't it original? No it's not. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was using the genre in a similar way long, long before this film came out. And was far cleverer and more subversive than this film could ever hope to be.I never laughed once during this try-hard-to-be-quirky piece of nonsense. Watch it if you're looking for an average bit of slapstick comedy. If you want something cleverer and more uniquely British watch any number of classic BBC comedies."
"Simon pegg cannot act and is not funny. So imagine my disdain when i see him trying ACTING in a alleged COMEDY. The plot is non existent ,zombies attack and hilarity is supposed to ensue.Unfortunately like every other movie pegg is in i spent an hour and a half waiting for something funny to happen. The credits must have beat them to it.almost every other person in the film including his long time friend frost is able to make the audience suspend their disbelief until mr pegg ruins it all again with his stilted freshly memorized acting work .Take my advice don't get dragged along to see his latest travesty because of how many brainless dolts think it looks mind alteringly funny . Deep down you just know it will be worse than showgirls"
"When my family told me they wanted to see ""Shaun of the Dead,"" I was less than thrilled. I thought it would be just another spoof/satire on all the zombie/horror movies that have previously been released.Was I in for a surprise. Although the first 10-15 minutes of laying the foundation of the movie seemed to be the typical droll, dry Brit humor (and I do mean dry)and very unimpressive, the movie took a turn. During this first 10-15 minutes, I was thinking of reasons why I should leave my seat and do ANYTHING - go to the bathroom, get popcorn, etc. However, I was helplessly stuck, as I had already powdered my nose and had a hot dog on my lap. All of a sudden,the movie picked up rapidly when Shaun and his hopeless roommate find a little ""drunk"" girl in the garden (zombie), and the poor guys came to the realization she was a monster. This was the turning point, when matters turned from severely dry to utter hysteria!!!! The plot was exceptional, when you think of two average (and less than average) Joes trying to deal with a zombie in the back yard. When they tried to throw kitchen utensils and, yes, a toaster at her, the whole theater was roaring! I especially loved the old record collection that Shaun frantically used to throw at other zombies, and at the same time, the methodical and selective process of which albums he wanted to throw and which he wanted to keep!The ways in which this average town first of all overlooked the zombies (just another day in town, ho hum) and then, dealing with them and at one point, trying to blend in so they could make their way to the Winchester Pub (I'm laughing even as I'm typing) was hilarious! Just walk like a zombie, don't say a word, and they won't know the difference! Too bad Shaun and his ex-girlfriend had to get into the inevitable spat and blow their cover!This was an unexpected treasure of a movie, with fresh and innovative writing. I would recommend this movie to all moviegoers!"
"A great idea - to send-up zombie movies - just doesn't hold up. (BTW, before I get going, I haven't ever had an opportunity to watch ""spaced"", so it could be that some of the problems I found are because the in-jokes are lost on me. But even so...)I loved the beginning of this movie -- the ignored snatches of newscasts, the slowly building feeling of things getting out of control, all done very cleverly (the z-day scene in the snack-shop was great!) It seemed to me, though, that the writer and directory kind of ran out of creative steam, and became more interested in little vignettes, at the expense of the general narrative (most specifically once the escape to the pub begins). Characters seemed alternatively oblivious to their situation and sharply aware of it; for instance collecting weapons, then abandoning them -- but not replacing them (so that after laying about with all sorts of useful implements, they spend vast amounts of time getting to the pub and inside of it totally unarmed, despite repeated opportunities). This takes farce into the realm of ridiculousness, as characters spend apparently endless time doing suicidally dumb things (like arguing, answering phones, etc.) while the zombies take five (or something). There's a line of farce just like there is a line of 'suspension of disbelief' -- disbelief doesn't apply here, but once you cross the line of farce, the audience (or at least me) won't pay attention to the attempts at humor any more. The viewer gives up, as I did, and so I couldn't enjoy the second half of the movie.A shame, really --'Shawn' had a LOT of potential. If the wit of the first half had extended to whole thing, it would have been quite a gem. It could have been up on the level of the Evil Dead series, but I think it missed the mark rather widely."
"A friend of mine recommended this film to me as IMDb rated it at >7. So I went to see it, which was the worst mistake I could possibly make. Although I appreciate British humour, this film just did not do it for me.Maybe it was the audience that was laughing hilariously at every scene, or maybe the film was just plain bad. It even got up to a point where I left the theatre to make a call. When I got back 5 minutes later, I did not even feel like I missed a part of the film.The only good thing was the way the camera moved around shaun on his way to the grocery store; that was brilliant. However not brilliant enough to push this film above a horrid 1."
"This is supposed to be a romantic zombie comedy. However, it's not romantic, scary or funny. None of the characters are interesting or entertaining.The New Zealand film Braindead is of this genre mix and is massively better, despite being filmed on a much smaller budget, over a decade earlier."
"I saw this movie expecting a comedy. I did not get one. I am usually good with switching genre mid-movie, but those movies at least had something that was supposed to be funny. Which part aside from the opening lines is supposed to be funny here? The part when he needs to kill a family member? The part where a man is ripped apart and his legs are then used as weapons? If you thought this movie was funny, you deserve to rot in hell. I understand that there were some British jokes, and I understood and was entertained by them for a few seconds. Then those dear to Shaun are brutally killed, and it's apparently supposed to be funny. If you have not seen this, get on your knees and thank whatever god you worship. If you were as unfortunate as me and wasted money on this, I relate. If you are someone who thought this movie was funny I've already told you where to go."
"I'm really very anxious to know how this got good reviews. I didn't find this movie remotely entertaining and would have shut it off immediately if I had control of the television at the time. This was an awful movie. I can appreciate the idea of a spoof on zombie films, but at least do it properly! The attempts at ironic humor and sarcasm were very dry and weak. It was neither laugh worthy nor relatively clever. I wasn't too fond of the acting or the use of a Queen song in the soundtrack. Queen is one of the greatest rock bands of all time, please do not defile their music by featuring it in something as awful as this. All in all, I thought this film was very stupid. If you are looking for a horror movie spoof I highly recommend Army of Darkness, but don't bother with Shaun of the Dead."
"Well, I'm not sure what everybody saw in this movie. I borrowed it from a friend, and he said ""oh man this is like my favorite movie all time."" and i watched it, and i didn't even know what to think. I couldn't tell if it was trying to be like, a big joke, some kind of parody, or if it was trying to be serious. He starts off by beating zombie people with a cricket mallet or whatever you want to call it, and then it turns more serious, and his mom gets infected and he is forced to shoot her. And then at the end, his best friend who is a zombie is locked away in his shed to be friends. I really couldn't find the main idea of the movie, but i guess its appealing to some people. But if your looking for some kind of action/gore movie, i'd rather get lord of the rings or gladiator."
"Spoilers herein.Movies are nearly always about other movies, and here's a great example.In this great piece of writing, we have explicit nods to three layered worlds. There's the world of the viewer, from which the simple artifacts of troubled relationships are drawn. At a rather precise rhythm, this is brought to the front, no matter what else happens.Then there's the layer of the pubgoers, Shaun and girlfriend. And under that is the world of the zombies. Ted's law is that when you have a film within a film, the abstract distance between the first and second is exactly the same as between the second and third. The film starts with Liz telling her boyfriend that she doesn't want to be with him any more because she is afraid she will become a zombie. The boyfriend goes around the room and takes apparent zombies and makes up a film for each one: gangsters, porn and so on.Then, we fall into a movie within the movie as effortlessly as an unwanted, even disturbing song comes up on the jukebox. It all centers on whether the pub is the place for zombies or non-zombies. Every action, every scene is drawn from prior films, and not always straight horror films.A dog can only look down the levels, never up. Except maybe. In the end, our hero has avoided the pub zombie disease; his buddy has not, which means he is pretty much at the end as he is in the beginning.'Stacy, Schoolgirl Zombies,' is another, more obvious example.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"Reading the good reviews and honestly, I don't get how its an 8? Did i completely miss the brilliant storyline with the well thought out ending? I mean, I read a lot of reviews and normally disagree with the bad reviews and I am sure that many will probably disagree with this, but I love a good comedy movie, what i love even more is a good zombie movie. So I thought this was a no brainer. All I can say now is wow, it was terrible I don't think I laughed or even smiled once, I think if I could i'd grab the gun and shoot myself first. I hated it because I felt like the dramatic scenes, if you have seen it, I think you spend at least 30minutes of him saying its his mum and he can't shoot his mum, I am not sure in what world these pro longed dramatic scenes are mean't to be funny but it was like a really terrible soap opera that never ended.I don't think I can think of anything positive to say about this movie sadly, the acting by Simon Pegg I felt was fake, the lack of common sense I guess some may find funny, but I find completely stupid.Anyway, I guess this movie was made in a time before great zombie, films like The Walking Dead, like World War Z and plenty of other movies released after this. If you are reading this, and are a fan of the zombie genre I sincerely hope you skip this movie."
"It was awful to watch, not funny, not interesting, not GOOD. It was bad as hell, please give me back 50 minutes of my life god ***.How can someone would like this movie? It was bad from the start and I didn't even finish it, it was horrible. Please, don't even try, you will lose your time, go watch another movie. i can't believe the reviews saying that this was good, cause it wasn't! I really love zombie movies but this is just horrible. The jokes were awful, the situations were obvious and very predictable, and the story itself was really bad and stupid, the end is even worst. i think this is the worst zombie movie i've seen this year. Don't waste your time watching this, and don't let them make you think this is good. Please take my advice, keep yourself away from this thing.by the way i didn't laugh Not even once"
"Well people who would have rated this this movie must be either in very good mood or very high on drugs. The first 10-15 minutes was good sensible comedy. Then the movie went down exponentially to total disgusting and non-humorous stupidity. Some of the stupid scene really bored and angered me so much that i would have wished the zombies would have bashed the brains of the characters for lame acting and immense lack of intelligence. Also there is lot of bloodshed and gore, which is not funny for zombie related movies. Better to watch other comedy movies from the same lead actors Ho* F**z (2007) if you want to really know the difference between comedy and stupidity."
"Hi everyone, I'm french and i like movies a lot, i watch like at least a movie per day. I watched Shaun of the dead last night with two of my friends and we thought the jokes were ridiculous and we would all give this film a 2.5. I won't develop on how bad the acting is etc... but I just want to know what did we miss. For example I read that Phillip's speech was very moving and i hope it was sarcasm. The point is so far I trusted IMDb a lot. IMDb was my reference and when a film had more than 7.5, I knew it was going to be good and now my friends make fun of me because of this film I made them see because it was High rated. I'm very frustrated, are there other people who felt the same way ???p.s: don't tell me I don't get British humor I'm fan of monthy python and I like it when people go crazy doing weird stuff and abstract jokes but sorry nothing like this in Shaun of the dead."
"Having consumed Our 2nd jar of Quality Street this festive season, my girlfriend and I decided to venture out to the pictures to enjoy what promised to be a movie with a difference - Shaun of the dead - which spoke boldly of being a romantic comedy.......with zombies. Sadly,this title is somewhat misleading inasmuch as there is little,if any,discernible romance,no comedy value of any description,and the implication that there may be some ""horror"" content is surely just a comment on the witless plot,wooden acting and utter pointlessness of this whole sorry debacle. This film, has, I'm afraid, got as much going for it as Simon Pegg's previous masterpiece,The Parole Officer,and will sink without trace only to be found in Blockbuster's bargain bin 6 months or so from now. Shame on the cast for even agreeing to appear in this shambling drivel. Do yourselves a favour - avoid Shaun of the dead,or leave the theatre looking and feeling like a zombie.You have been warned!"
"Beats me... ""the wittier and more intelligent British comedy in years"" what was the DVD's cover said... Ha, ha! I fell for it...This film is absolute crap and I don't recommend to watch it, not even to my worst enemy (I hope he saw it, though)... please, if you haven't seen it, stay away from this ****, you will thank me...Bad acting, worse lines, stupid plot (was there a plot?), I'm aware this **** was a parody but come on, there was no irony, humor, witticism, nothing which could save this stupid movie...Believe it or not, I felt so dirty after watching this poor excuse of a film that I had to bathe myself after the end...I promise, I won't see a British so called comedy again, ever... I feel sorry, sad and pathetic for wasting that time watching this **** (do you see a pattern? about the grayed four letters word? Well, that is because SofD is, a total, complete ****)"
"For some reason it is rated high, but this film is low! I just can't get it; how could people rate it so high?! This one of the crappiest movies I've ever seen. It's stupid and it's bad. It's supposed to be a funny horror movie. Well, it's not funny and it's not scary. It's yet another of those boring movies you usually encounter while zapping into some accidental channel on your hotel's TV, in a foreign country where you don't yet know the channels.If you start watching it and think to yourself ""hmm, that's quite.. bad.."" then don't expect it to get better later on. It doesn't. It stays just as bad. Save yourself the time---avoid.1/10"
This movie was such complete garbage that it wasn't even worth the electricity I paid to view it. This movie stuns me that it even made it to the box office or for that matter even had a 30 second commercial to advertise it.I think half of the people on this website voting this movie an 8 or a 7 are out of their minds.I rate this movie a 1 for awful. But if it were my choice I would give it less than that. Say maybe a .079.This movie definitely tries too hard to be like Scary Movie.
"""Shaun of the Dead"" is a cheap and cheerful Zombie Brit Flick. With the accent firmly on ""cheap"".It looks and feels as if it was hastily conceived by a group of six form students on a media studies field trip. More akin to ""Carry on Screaming"" than ""An American Werewolf in London"".Which is a shame really, because the horror genre has plenty of comic mileage left in it - if you can get the balance right.And that's another thing. Is it obligatory these days for British film directors to include at least one (or in this instance two) unemployed actors from TV's ""The Office""? OK it was a very funny series while it lasted, but it's been flogged to death and I'm bored with it now.Let's face it, Lucy Davis was hardly a barrell of laughs in this film was she?"
"SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) ***1/2 Horror and comedy have been going hand-in-hand ever since Abbott & Costello met Frankenstein over 50 years ago and this latest installment of the you've-got-your-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter genre splicing from the Brits is a laugh riot shockfest the likes not seen since George A.Romero's 'Living Dead' films and the early splatter fests of Peter Jackson.Set in a rural London burg of overcast skies and proletariat listlessness the film begins with our unlikely hero and slayer of zombies in the pasty skinned form of Shaun (Pegg who resembles Mike White, Jack Black's roomie in 'School of Rock'), an electronics store clerk who seems stunted at the age of 29 going on 13, or so his out-of-his-league pretty girlfriend Liz (the fetching Ashfield) feels as she confronts him one night in his fave pub hangout The Winchester. Liz's long-suffering has come to a head and more-or-less expects some drastic changes if Shaun is to be part of her life, namely his pot-smoking lifelong chum and flatmate Ed (Frost who resembles fellow countryman Mark Addy of 'The Full Monty') whose only talent seems to be video games and taking up space. On hand for this revelation is Liz's pals Dianne and David (Davis and Moran, respectively her girlfriend and her unbeknownst would-be lover), a couple of acquaintance, who provide some moral support for the put-upon Liz.Cut to Shaun's next morning ritual of sleep-walking thru his daily trek to his dead-end job making his rounds to the local bodega and taking in the equally dank and depressive working-class enclave. Unknowingly in the background are some tell-tale signs that something is amiss in the form of an unsettling plague suddenly overtaking the country with out-of-focus TVs in the background showing scattershot footage ofwell you knowShaun forgets to make dinner reservations for Liz and himself and winds up on the skids with his lady love. Depressed he and Ed go to their watering hole for some soul searching and youth rekindling as they get pissed and rap to 'Whitelines' (in one of several truly funny sequences) as they head home.The next morning Shaun goes thru his gimlet-eyed routine but there is definitely something wrong and what's so dead-on (puns more to come!) is director Wright (who makes a fine big-screen debut from a career in BBC TV programmes and co-wrote the scabrous ingenious screenplay with Pegg) accurately showing just how brain-dead life can be in the numbing daily constitutionals we take for granted replacing the monotony with monstrosity as a horde of zombies from some unknown viral infection spreads quickly as Shaun and his friends soon realize it's the end of the world as they know it!Sprinkled with liberal amounts of humor  both scatological and witty in-the-know as well as slapstick  with horror (good amount of biting and one  of many  homage scenes to Romero involving a truly nasty buh-bye a la 'Dawn of the Dead') but not exactly wall-to-wall viscera (although the blood is by the buckets) but shares in spirit more closer to Jackson's 'DeadAlive' with its gonzo-style mix of murder and mayhem and a few echoes of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' Ash character and even Mike Leigh's too-true working stiffs of his oeuvre and Richard Curtis' smart veddy proper British romantic comedies a la 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.Simon and Frost make a fine comic duo of not-so-dumb and dumber in their bonking on the beans of the undead as well as fine able ensemble including the pretty Ashfield as the slightly-believable gal pal (come on Shaun you're one lucky slag!) and Nighy , late of 'Love Actually', as his stepfather who endures some painful confessions. The collaborators all have had some significant success across the pond and clearly have the chops in this valentine to the previously mentioned genres (Shaun's blithering mum is named Barbara a nod to Romero's heroine in 'Night of the Living Dead').The film is riotously funny with sharp editing (lots of montages of items being quick-pan slapped about purpose) and a few startles prior to the onslaught that totally sets the mood of this cheeky and scary horror comedy with a surprisingly sweet chewy center. A cult classic in the making."
"This was easily one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen. It was supposed to be funny - well it wasn't funny in the least. Actually, what I found hilarious was the fact that I lost 90-ish minutes of my life watching this movie. I have seen some BAD movies in my day, and most of the time I can find something to appreciate about them. Shaun of the Dead has NO redeeming value to it whatsoever. I had wanted to root for his character, until I realized that HE wrote the script. I heard a four-letter ""C"" word ONE too many times to tolerate and found that British humor is incredibly offensive - if this is, in fact, ""British humor."" Think it's because I'm a girl? My fiancé, who LOVES toilet humor and parodies, begged me to turn it off. He said it was worse than having his nose hairs ripped out with a tweezers then having lemon juice poured up his nose. That's pretty bad. It was simply the most over-rated pile of rubbish I have ever seen. I do not recommend it and I sincerely hope that the writer seriously considers a new career."
"Edgar Wright's smash hit self proclaimed ""rom-zom-com,"" is set in England during the midst of the zombie outbreak. During which, fumbling Shaun and company decide to wait the horrors out at a local pub, and decide to let things sort themselves out over a nice cool pint.Surprisingly, the film actually has a solid sense of motivation. Shaun is really just the wrong guy, at the wrong place, at the wrong time. While he is still horrified, he decides it is just what he needs to prove his worth to ex, Liz. As a huge horror fan myself, I was laughing like crazy in the film. Everyone is fleshed out as dimensional characters, who you're actually kind of sad to see die, and trust me when I say, that people die hard in this movie.As they come, Shaun Of The Dead is an amazing horror comedy. It's editing is fast and swift, the direction is a complement to the very foundation of film. It's hard not to say; You should totally Buy It On Blu-Ray"
"Here is another movie that I discovered purely by accident, and could not be happier that I did. One lonely night, looking through the shelves at Blockbuster, I happened upon this and rented it.
This is the story of a lovable loser named Shaun, his ever present friend Ed and his girlfriend Liz. As Shaun tries to be the man Liz needs, while staying the man-child friend Ed needs, he keeps screwing up his relationship with Liz. This leads to her dumping him. The next day, resolved to win her back, also happens to be the beginning of the Zombie apocalypse. The hilarity ensues as Shaun tries to get his mom, Ed and Liz to safety.
What works about this movie is everything. Simon Peg is a huge horror nerd, so there are many outright, the movie title for one, and even more tongue in cheek nods to what came before in the genre. There is also a great social commentary that runs through the movie, where you can see they are trying to show that the human race has become little more than zombies already. This is a perfect fil for anyone that has a sense of humor and likes zombies/horror movies."
"There is a reason why after 15 years this film still has a high rating and is still a fond favourite of mine to watch!The beginning of the Cornetto trilogy (not including Spaced) goes off with a bang. Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost delivers a fun packed action Zombie Thriller.We are introduced to Shaun (Pegg) looking animated in a pub whilst being spoken at by Liz (Kate Ashfield) about their sinking relationship. Ed (Frost) is introduced whilst playing a slot machine, he is overweight, dirty and foul mouthed (a bit of a stereotype) which has me laughing from the start. A series of events with Shaun failing Liz's needs and being obsessed with the Winchester Pub sees him being dumped and then to make matters worse the zombie apocalypse arrives...With Ed in tow Shaun's plan is to: Take car. Go to mum's. Kill Phil, grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over. A perfect plan in Shaun's eyes... but then that wouldn't make a film if all plans went accordingly.With a British star studded cast of Bill Nighy, Peter Seraginowicz, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Penelope Wilton, Martin Freeman and many more it is no wonder why this comedy has become a cult classic and possible the best Zombie film, unintentionally, out there.Mentions also must be made to all behind the scenes too, with a limited budget Wright has created a masterpiece. For those more into the Cornetto universe then keeping an eye out to all nods of pervious enterprises and future is a must. Especially when seeing Tyres from spaces as a zombie in the crowd.I will forever live this film and glad it has become the classic that it is!"
"Shawn of the dead is a great spoof of the zombie genre which is funny and a breeze to sit through. Perhaps the best way to describe the film's comedy is to call it ""British humor."" Don't expect a gag-a-minute affair like Scary Movie, or a TV sit-com approach. Shaun of the Dead's niche is much closer to the one occupied by Evil Dead 2 (and its sequel, Army of Darkness) and Tremors. Those movies understood what makes a good horror movie, then had some fun with the premise, neither taking it too seriously nor utilizing contempt in its ridicule. Shaun of the Dead is a movie that one might not expect to work at first glance, but, for those who don't mind a little laughter with their zombies (or perhaps it should be the other way around), this is an unusual source of entertainment. If you are in the mood for some zombie action, I suggest you watch Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the dead in succession. This is great entertainment."
"Everything in this movie works to perfection. The comedy is on point, the acting, it's a perfect combination of scary and funny, in just the right amounts. My favorite thing about this movie is the directing by Edgar Wright. He has a way of showing thigs that shouldn't be all that interesting in an insanely original fashion. For example, at the beginning of the movie, when Shaun is slowly finding out that there's something wrong, it's shown in an original way. So is everything else in the film. I won't say much, but this is a fantastic film. Also, very emotional and deep when it needs to be."
"You could call this a horror film, but its more comedy than horror, Yes, there is high amounts of blood and gore but when it is done it is all done in an amazingly funny fashion. It is brilliantly funny and action-packed, which is strange for a comedy. It is amazing and I do reccommend it."
"Oh Edgar, you brilliant, brilliant man. Every time I go back to it I find something new, some new, subtle plot device or Easter egg. Not only is it the best zombie movie ever, it's hilarious and an exceptionally crafted film over all."
"This is the only 2nd comic horror film I have seen, having been put off by finding Young Frankenstein unfunny (perhaps a letdown after the brilliant Producers), but I surprised myself in finding this film hysterically funny. What prompted me to try it was the wonderful Simon Pegg, who I saw in an episode of Black Books and the star-studded cast of other comic actors eg Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy). We all know these people: the nerdy but nice fellow in a crap job who lacks the social skills to keep their friends, girlfriends and other folk happy simultaneously, but it was wonderful to watch this ostensibly sad character become the hero in the face of a zombie invasion. This film was entertaining, fast moving, and gripping to the very end, and the elements of sadness, romance, and conflict added to its charm It has whetted my appetite to watch more movies of this genre."
"Slack-jawed, vacant stare, lurching, staggering gait ... I'm not talking about the zombies in ""Shaun of the Dead"". I'm talking about some of the people I saw after I left the theatre.""Shaun of the Dead"" is not scary. What's scary is that there are people out there, around us, among us, who live as though they were zombies. People for whom life is never anything more than working 9 to 5 in a dead-end job, then coming home to spend the evening as couch potatoes in front of the TV or video games. People with no soul or spirituality. People for whom there is no heaven or hell, no thought of survival after death. People for whom mere survival in life is about as much as they can handle.People of whom John Cougar Mellencamp sang, ""Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.""As it turns out, the zombies in ""Shaun of the Dead"" are creatures of habit. They may be brain-dead, but they can perform menial, mindless, mechanical tasks -- just like any real live working-class stiff.I was led to believe that ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a satire on the modern British middle class. Ghoul Britannia, so to speak. Bangers and monster mash.But ""Shaun of the Dead"" is universal in its import, a comedy with a tragic message. And the message is this: The greatest thing modern man has to fear is not death. It is life in death."
"Something told me, from the first time I saw the trailer, that I was going to love this movie. I'm glad that I can trust my instincts because Shaun of the Dead rocked. Hard. This has to be, without a doubt, the best movie of it's kind since Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" and it's one of the funniest movies I saw all year.The plot is simple: Shaun is a guy (not much different from me) who works a droning job, spends most of his free time with his roommate Ed, playing video games, and downing beer after beer at the local Pub. In fact, when we first meet him, he's being dumped by his girlfriend Liz, who is tired of the same old routine. Yeah, it takes a while for the zombie action to kick in, but I was having such a good time with Shaun and Ed, I really didn't care. The dialog is so well-written and the chemistry between the two are so good, I would've been satisfied had this been a straight comedy, without zombies. Anyway, on a very bad hangover, Shaun slowly (and I do mean SLOWLY) begins to realize that all is not well in London. He finally puts it all together when a girl shows up in the backyard, falls on a pipe (which impales her), then gets up and proceeds to attack. After watching the news, the two slowly begin to realize that people are starting to turn into zombies and eat each other. In what is probably my favorite scene, the two devise a plan to escape their house, pick up Shaun's mother, kill Phil (Shaun's stepfather, because he's been bitten) pick up Liz, then find a nice, safe place to hide out and wait for things to cool down. The way that the whole thing is shown is flat-out brilliant and if something of it's kind has been filmed before, then I'm just unaware. Love that sequence.I can't begin to count the reasons why I loved this movie. The acting was topnotch, the dialog will have you quoting for years to come, the directing was brilliant, and then there's the zombies and the gore....Let's just say that ""Shaun of the Dead"" had one of the most gruesome death scenes I've ever witnessed in any movie EVER. All in all, this movie is flawless.On a side note: I watched this movie ONCE and was able to remember all of the characters names without having to go back and double check myself. Taking my short-term (almost nonexistent) memory into consideration, that's really saying something."
