"Made in 1919, ""The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari"" was literally years ahead of its time and remains a triumphant accomplishment in the genre of German Expressionism. Remembered mainly for its stunning sets, which featured crooked buildings and twisted landscapes, ""Cabinet"" also boasts one of the first attempts at a twist ending, something quite new and shocking for its time.Told mainly from the point of view of Francis, a young man who lives in the small village of Holstenwall, Germany, ""Cabinet"" tells the tale of murder and madness which seems to accompany the arrival of a carnival. Francis and his best friend Alan go to the carnival and are presented with the sideshow attraction Cesare the Somnambulist, a gaunt and hideous young man who spends his life sleeping in a coffin-like cabinet and seems able to predict the future when awake. Cesare (played by a young Conrad Veidt, who later went on to play the evil Nazi general in Casablanca) informs Alan that he will soon die, and indeed, Alan is found murdered the next morning. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange keeper, a man called Caligari. As Francis desperately tries to solve the mystery and find his friends killer, it seems that the beautiful young Jane, beloved by both Alan and Francis, has been targeted as the next victim.This is a genuinely creepy film which delves deep into the mysteries of the abnormal mind...an uncomfortable journey to say the least. Everyone is suspect and, in the end, we must ask ourselves: ""who is really the mad one here?"" Subtle and ingenious, we see the world the way an insane person might see it; warped and confused, a nightmarish terrain where nothing makes sense and balance is not to be found. The impact of this film is still being felt and seen today, and for good reason. It is a shocking, disturbing masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"It struck me last night that I've never seen a serious silent film. Everyone's seen a silent comedy: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Keystone Cops... They've all been immortalized in the minds of every film viewer, and I enjoy them as much as anyone. But it seems a strange and almost disrespectful lack to never have seen anything but comedy; so many silent films were created, and the only ones I've seen starred waddling tramps.It was partially for that reason that I rented this movie. I had read about it on a film review site (the name of which escapes my memory) and decided it was worth the half-hour drive to the video store. The basic premise is that of a man relating a story that happened to him and his friends - their unnerving discovery of a crazed mountebank, Dr. Caligari, and his prophetic sleepwalker. It follows a series of murders and growing madness, keeping you in constant suspense and confusion until the very last scene.There's a period of adjustment when watching it - unfortunately necessary for a modern audience. The titles seem too slow. The camera seems to hold on scenes too long. The makeup on the actors' faces seem ghostly and horrible - even on the hero.But before long, the movie has you in its grip. You spend time staring at the architecture - buildings, doors, and windows that would have been funny in a Dr. Seuss book. In the film, they make you uneasy. The whole atmosphere is of a world gone wrong; like a dream worthy of Salvador Dalí. Nothing is square or straight. The buildings loom in on you; windows sweep upward, slanted or curved; doors are obscenely angled holes beckoning you to enter and be trapped inside.Throughout, the story defies expectations. Small plot twists confuse and mislead you until the final surprise, completely tearing down everything you thought the movie was about. Strange shadows and shots from inside alleys paint the film's world as something terrible, never allowing you a normal look at the village, never allowing you to enjoy the quaintness of it. Through it all, the grinning, hunched figure of Dr. Caligari hangs in your mind, pushing out rational thought.The movie is well worth your time; there's a certain pleasure in trying to capture the feeling of terror an early audience, unaccustomed to the visual effects we see every day, would have had the first time they saw this movie. It's an intellectual terror in the grand old style, giving you the same thrill you get from reading Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. At the risk of sounding cliché: two thumbs up!"
"Like so many of the films from the silent era, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari gets overlooked (if you can even find it!) for big budget duds, and runny romantic comedies. Directors of the period like Griffith, Lang, Eisenstien, and Caligari's Wiene, are never given the credit they deserve. And if credit is given, it is in small cultish circles in various pockets around the world.The set design here is amazing, not a single right angle can be found in any one of the sets. This may not only apply to the disjointed and distorted characters in the film, but also the state of Germany at the time. After all, the film was made in the dark ages in Germany between WWI and WWII. This point is validated by Siegfried Kracauer, with his notion of how the main character of Dr. Caligari can be easily interpreted to Hitler, and vice versa. Both controlled subjects with a form of ""brainwashing"", both were upset with current forms of society and government, and both were masters of deception. In a period where Germans were looking for direction, and let's face it, authority as well, Dr. Caligari embodied it fully.In the area of the players, all the names in the film turn out a literally ""speechless"" performance. Dagover, Krauß, and especially Veidt as Cesare (pronounced Chez-a-ray) are excellent in the use of gestures and motion to get their point across without using words. The camera, stationary as in most early features, uses the mise-en-scene effectively, letting us identify with characters such as Francis and Jane, and disjointing us from Caligari, and the Criminal.The use of lines and stripes, not only in the sets but in small places like in the good doctor's hair and on his gloves, adds to the telling of the character. Colour tints of the B&W film also play a special part in bringing the whole film together. An amazing sequence where Caligari reveals his true madness, pits Caligari stumbling through the unequal streets of Germany while being haunted by textual ramblings written in the air. A marvelous achievement for it's time. And it adds so much.The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari has changed the way I look at horror films, and even films in general. I urge anyone reading this to pick up this film. The DVD offering is utterly fantastic with the restored print, an audio essay of the film, and production notes. Bypass the overblown ""motion picture events of the year"", and pick up Caligari, quite possible the greatest motion picture event in the history of motion pictures."
"Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the ""total work of art,"" or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.This film is best seen at night, alone, and with the modern soundtrack which is available on the fully restored version. If the DVD you're watching does not have (a) choice of two soundtracks (traditional music and much-scarier modern track), (b) tinted inter-titles set in a surrealistic (actually expressionistic) font, and (3) is fairly high quality, then send it back and get the restored version. The quality and completeness of silent films are a major factor in experiencing the art form as it was meant to be experienced. The modern sound track in Dr. Caligari makes the film much more accessible for modern audiences (the eerie effects in the modern track heighten the feel of the film for the modern viewer) - try both tracks, you'll see.It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.Anyway, I think the film is best viewed with NO NOTICE. You don't really want to know the plot (the meaning of the end of the film can be interpreted in radically different ways - keep that in mind when it happens). Only one note - artistically the German Expressionist movement is worth reading about after you see the film - you'll notice the theme of ""death and the maiden"" woven into this artwork. Also, this film is the direct ancestor of films like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and a lot more - you'll recognize the Expressionist look in many presentations in television and film.WARNING - I would NOT show this film to children. It's very subtly and psychologically undermining - you'll be thinking and freaking about this thing for months to come - such a thing shouldn't be experienced by children - it's an adult, art film (no, not that kind) made for adults."
"Francis (Friedrich Feher) and an old man are sitting and Francis begins to tell him a story, hoping to top the one the man just told him. The story is about a fair that came to his hometown of Hostenwall and a man, Dr. Caligari who was one of the vendors. Caligari's submission to the fair is his somnambulist, Cesare (Conrad Veidt) who has been asleep for 25 years and, under Dr. Caligari's willing, is about to awaken. He does and Dr. Caligari tells the crowd to ask him a question, for he knows the future. Francis is there with his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), and Alan walks up and asks Cesare how long he'll live, to which Cesare replies that he'll be dead by dawn.Alan and Francis both long for the same woman, Jane (Lil Dagover) and after they all three go home, we see, inside Alan's house, the shadows of he and his killer fighting on his bedroom wall. Francis goes to tell the police after he realizes the somnambulist's prophecy has come true. Back at Dr. Caligari's place, we see him feeding gruel to Cesare as he lay in a coffin. Another attempted murder takes place but turns out to be the work of a common crook not involved with Cesare and Dr. Caligari. More happens that's not really important. Francis goes to an insane asylum to see if the fled Dr. Caligari is a patient there but the worker he speaks with tells him he must go see the head of the institute for patient information, as he's not allowed to divulge that sort of thing. So Francis goes to the head's office (a skeleton stands upright in the corner) and it turns out to be Dr. Caligari himself.Francis gets the police over there and after looking through his books, they discover a historical book about the mythical Caligari, who did just what Dr. Caligari is doing now, back in 1093. When Dr. Caligaru arrives he goes insane, saying he must become Caligari and doctors in the institute put him in a straight jacket. Then the telling of the story is done. The film adds a framing device, though, in the present with Francis and the man he's told the story to. The two go back to the institute, Cesare is in the corner and Francis warns the old man not to accept one of his prophesies, for he should surely die. Jane is there also, and when Francis asks her to marry him, she says she cannot marry someone not of royal blood (huh?). Then down the stairs comes Dr. Caligari, whom Francis quickly gets in a scuffle with. He's grabbed by the doctors and taken upstairs. Dr. Caligari comes to the conclusion that Francis is manic and that his mania is caused by his delusion that Dr. Caligari is in fact the mythic Caligari who would wander from town to town with Cesare killing townsfolk. The last scene is of Dr. Caligari saying he has a sure-fire cure for Francis' mania.So was Francis the real Caligari? Did Francis kill Alan in the hopes of getting Jane to marry him? (After all, we never do see his killer.) With this appended narrative twist, the entire story comes into question. I have a feeling a lot of people would hate this but I found it very interesting, maybe even historic.The film is very dreamlike. All silent films are sort of spooky, but this one is more otherworldly. Everything is distorted and the camera, with that strange blackening, gives it an unstable touch like our most vivid dreams have. It's like something's been placed over the lens in order to highlight certain characters or visuals and cover up something else. I'm assuming the film used on-set camera tricks.The expressionist sets consist of slanted walls, crooked doors, weirdly misshapen glasses, paint splashed on stairs that bend. A background that is clearly a wall with painting. Trees that look like wires. The characters' faces are all pale white and the blacks are all stark. Cesare, specifically, looks like a cross between Frankenstein's Monster and Edward Scissorhands. The houses don't look like houses, they look like pieces of wood painted to look like a stage set.I can see influence from this film in the set designs of Tim Burton especially, and the narrative twist at the end must have influenced David Lynch in ""Mulholland Drive.""The print I saw was from 1992 and for a movie that's 83 years old, I was very impressed. There was very little grain and the lighting was fine. The only complaint I had was that some of the handwriting from Dr. Caligari's writings was a bit difficult to read and that has nothing to do with the print. The music is all organ that comes booming in whenever something evil -- usually Dr. Caligari -- is onscreen. It's hard to judge movies like these, but the visuals are wonderful, the music is spooky, the acting suitable and the pacing fine (it's a little over an hour). I would say this is an essential film, and unlike many ""groundbreaking"" classics, it's like nothing else you've seen.
***1/2"
"The original message of this film is fairly pedestrian (an outcry against the weak authority in Germany at the time), although the political intrigue surrounding the production led to a fascinating framing story which re-established ""the authorities,"" and in turn made the UFA happy enough to distribute the film. This suggests that in its own time the political message of the film was fairly powerful, but compared to the work done in such films as The Golem, Nosferatu, and Metropolis it is not so far-reaching.What sets this film apart from its contemporaries is its absolute commitment to the expressionist movement. Mutated sets, heavy dark/light makeup, light and shadow, and a Gothic storyline are classic expressionism. The photography is beautiful and so crisp that it creates an eerie sense that this hellish scene is actually the real world, and that our everyday lives are the delusional Technicolor dream of a madman.While there are many better movies made in this period, I feel that this one is the pinnacle of the imagery that is characteristic of the expressionist art form. It is an absolute must-see for anyone who is interested in the Expressionist movement."
"The original screenplay did not contain the frame that many use in their analysis of the film. As it was intended by the authors,it presents a story in which ""Caligari represents the insanity of unlimited power, and his medium is the common man, which the authoritarian state trains to do its killing."" The story was written by Hans Janowitz, a Czech, and Carl Mayer, and Austrian. They combined events of their lives to come up with a fantastic tale. Janowitz supposedly saw a pretty girl he wished to speak to but she was being followed by another man. He gave her up as lost but the following day he learned that the girl, whose name was Gertrude, had been murdered the night before. He recalled the suspicious man, who was also at her funeral, but he had no evidence against him and so said nothing. Meyer, whose father committed suicide, had to undergo many psychiatric examinations and grew to hate psychiatrists. They determined to write a script together combining these two things, but had no plot for it until they visited a fair together. There they saw an exhibit entitled ""Man or Machine"" in which a man performed amazing feats and uttered prophecies while under hypnosisthey had their story. It combined all three experiences into a horrific thriller. The story, however, was not to be produced as they intended. According to Otto Friedrich, the ""authors of Caligari intended it not just as a horror movie but as a kind of revolutionary allegory."" As such, the powers that be were bound to find it unacceptable. Producer Erich Pommer bought the script and added and opening and closing scene. In the opening scene Francis is sitting on a bench in some kind of park with another man. They watch Jane walk by, seemingly in a trance. Francis then begins to tell his story. After he is finished explaining everything that happened the audience soon sees Francis in the lobby of the asylum with many other people, including Jane. Francis begs Jane to finally marry him but she responds, ""We queens are not permitted to follow the dictates of our hearts."" As the much friendlier looking director/Dr. Caligari comes down the stairs, Francis begins screaming that he is Caligari. Francis is put into a straight jacket and put in a cell. The director/Dr. Caligari puts his glasses back on and once again looks fairly creepy. He then says, ""At last I understand mania. He thinks I am that mystic Caligariand now I also know how to cure him."" Instead of a story about the triumph over authority, it is simply the babble of a madman. Simply appreciating the story and the meaning behind it is not enough. Instead of being played in an ordinary world, the entire set is expressionistic. Buildings are painted at angles. Doors and windows are crooked or rounded. Nothing meets at right angles. It appears as a world not entirely in the realm of fantasy nor is it completely on earth. Despite the story and the scenery being fantastic, everything is a reflection of the real worldincluding the fact that Cesare and Francis both lose in the end. The authorities winin reality and in the film. Even the props lend themselves to this overblown idea of authority. The town clerk's desk and stool are set very high. In order to get to the police, the characters have to walk up stairs, and even still, their furniture is higher than normalin case there was a question as to who was in charge. The shadows and lightening also reflect the film's expressionism. The backdrop was painted with extensive shadows to further the eerie quality. In addition, the entire screen is rarely completely illuminated. The audience's attention is focused on the important by using what would be a spotlight in a play. Sometimes only a person's face or the spinning top of a carousel can be seen at all, sometimes they are brightest while the rest of the screen is darker, and sometimes the entire scene is in full view. This gives it a very story-like feel and does much to enhance the movie. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a classical example of expressionism. Ironically, it is an expressionism tempered by authority. Regardless of what the audience of today thinks of the once incredibly popular movie, few would walk away from it feeling as though they had wasted their time. Original audiences may not have realized that it was, indeed, the story of triumph over authority, but those of today are better able to see this."
"This picture is a masterpiece ! How could someone think in something like this at that time ? The film has really good casting ! Werner Krauss is excellent playing Doctor Caligari and Conrad Veidt (Cesare) too !
This movie has an obscure and bizarre mood makes the film looks really scary sometimes ... The painted scenario gave the film the touch that it needed ! It puts you in a nightmarish world , gives you the sensation of claustrofobia , depression and madness ! The objects have a strange shape and an irregular geometry that collaborate for the maintenance of the dark mood !But the most important thing in this motion picture is the open ended story ! You´re never sure about the end ! It has so many ways of interpretation... It´s useless to try to define ""one end"" to this movie. You´ll be always asking yourself about the legitimacy of the man´s vision of the story.It´s not scary , just sometimes , as I said. But it´s dark and it uses the shadows and lights effects so well that I was amazed the first time I saw and I still amazed ! German Films of that time were really good !Congratulations to Robert Wienne and his cast ! It´s a masterpiece of madness and paranoia!Rating : *****/******"
"Having only started discovering silent movies recently, I don't have more than a handful of other non-talkies to compare it to. This however was not only one of the best, most compelling and unique silents I have seen, but also a great flick overall. It's all been said before, I'm sure, but I'll say it again: this is a milestone of German Expressionist cinema. It is also a class-A mind-phuck movie (excuse my French), one of those stories that'll leave you eternally scratching your head trying to figure out what you've seen, what to believe and what can be a plausible explanation for most of the creepy mysteries you've just witnessed. Right from the very opening scene, seemingly suspended in an otherworldly dimension, maybe somewhere in between life and death, in which the first line spoken is: ""There are spirits everywhere"", you realise you are in for a spooky ride (this is the ultimate Halloween movie, come to think of it!) Having studied theatre set and costume design at Rome's art school for a year before going to university, I was obviously completely fascinated by the set design choices here. Buildings and furniture, props and painted backdrops are elongated and deformed into blocky, savage, expressionistic, perspective-defying and proportion-less forms. Even the intertitles weren't of the traditional sort. The result is obviously one of unsettling the viewer further into believing themselves suspended in a reality where anything could happen - anything horrible or nightmarish, obviously. Nothing is as it seems, right to the very end. Btw, on a more frivolous note, I thought the character of Cesare the Somnambulist looked uncannily like something that might have influenced Tim Burton into creating Edward Scissorhands, or maybe even more, the look of some of the characters in Rocky Horror Picture Show."
"The most important film in horror. Moody and shocking this chiller is the height of German Expressionist cinema and the prototype for whole genres in horror. Using violent contrasts of light and shadow, surreal settings and distorted camera angles to represent madness, chaos and psychosis, its influence is still seen even today in the likes of John Carpenter and the emerging actor and director Stephen Armourae, who has been also influenced by the film in his artwork and as the composer Stephen Armourae-Perry. Its twists towards the end put everyone from Hitchcock to the maker of 'The Village' into pale imitation. This film is now neglected by the public as it is a silent film. It really needs to be seen and appreciated more. Robert Wiene the director clearly inspired by the First World War transferred that shock and terror onto the screen with all its starkness. Hos purpose was to present moral ambiguity of the plot and action as a commentary on the paranoia, imbalance and uncertainty of post was Germany. And another parallel: not only has it influenced Stephen Armourae, he too is a hypnotist and recurring themes in his writings and plays are the moral ambiguities of insanity and culture, and German society of the twentieth century."
"`The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' may not be the kind of film that would shock today's audience, but its fascinating and horrific use of surrealistic atmosphere clearly had an influence on modern filmmakers such as David Cronenberg and David Lynch. While the story is not as involving as other German masterworks of the era, such as ""Metropolis,"" it can be appreciated for its unique vision.The thing that really strikes me about this film is the way the set design reflects the unstable mind of the narrator. The exterior scenes often include painted backgrounds featuring houses with sloped roofs and jutting edges, along with mountains that seem to twist and curl upwards into the sky. Although these backgrounds are not three-dimensionally realistic, they convincingly depict the gothic, surrealistic atmosphere with imagination and verve. The interior scenes have a claustrophobic feeling that generates from the walls, which are often at odd angles and slanting inward as they rise. Much of the design appears to be influenced by cubism; even the sinister Dr. Caligari looks square-shaped. The lighting also reflects the chilling mood, with shadows haunting the nooks and crannies in the background.The characters in the film sometimes seem equally freakish. All the actors wear makeup that make them appear as pale as a ghost, and the men are decked out in dark suits and capes. Ominous figures approach the camera directly in two haunting sequences early on: in the opening scene, when we see Jane walking towards us in a ghost-like white gown, and in the initial carnival scene, when Ceasre steps out of his box. In the end, we learn that it is really Francis who was insane the whole time; thus, the sets during the story, which is told by Francis himself, reflect his disoriented mind. Not surprisingly, the bookend scenes where he tries to tell his tale to an old man in a garden are the only ones to involve natural surroundings, such as trees and grass.For a one-hour horror film, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" requires a lot of concentration on the viewer's part, especially since the story sometimes seems fragmented. Nonetheless, it will no doubt prove fascinating for years to come."
"I saw this film on the same day that I saw Trainspotting, and those two films made me realise what cinema can really do. This is a film that tells it EXACTLY as the film makers see it. The warped visuals say more about its subjects than words ever could. The travelling fair is as twisted and ugly as all travelling fairs seem to be, and the expressionist sets and lighting sum up perfectly the sense of urban alienation in a very unnerving way. It's story is simple enough to be accessible, but don't expect a straightforward film - just let it speak to you."
"I am 23 years old and am rapidly becoming extremely bored with modern Hollywood.I am not a film student, I only came across this because I was going through the top 250 on here and was amazed at the year of this one, so I picked up the DVD.I would love a time machine to see something like this being made.It transcends time, and one could argue it has been ""borrowed"" from throughout this past century.Well worth a few slow moments, the plot style is years ahead of its time. Its quite graphic in some areas too, this also came as a huge surprise to me.I can't even explain the feeling you get watching this, its like the deep dark secret of Alfred Hitchcock, John Carpenter and Tim Burton all rolled into one. As directors they've all made history in their own right, but this movie just reminds me of them in some way, its tough to explain.My version featured colorization of certain scenes, but it was done with a semi transparent color tint frame I am not sure the original featured this...Reguardless, if you have some patience and are in the mood for something a little different, try this. You will not soon forget it.10/10 without question."
"The psychotic dreamscapes of this movie are so intense it has lost none of it's original power over the years. The scenery alone makes this film a unique experience well beyond what modern film has produced.I often say, and I will say it again: German films from this period are the best - ever! And this one is the best of them all!"
"Any fan of horror or German expressionism needs to see this 1920 classic. Considered by many to be the first true horror movie, this is a story that doesn't need sound to get under your skin. Francis (Friedrich Feher) tells the story of Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), who hosts a sideshow exhibit at a local carnival featuring Cesare (Conrad Veidt), a somnambulist who has been asleep for 23 years. Dr. Caligari is able to awaken Cesare through hypnotic suggestion for the entertainment of the onlookers. It seems that Dr. Caligari might have other uses for Cesare as well. Shortly after their arrival, town-folk start turning up dead. It isn't long before suspicion falls upon the tragic Cesare. But things are not entirely as they seem. Francis may not be the hero we are led to believe he is. Any review of this movie would be remiss without mentioning the set design. With nary a right angle in sight, the sets are as much a part of the story as the actors. The strange design certainly contributes to the madness the film means to convey and sets the mood for a truly creepy story. Don't pass this one up just because it is a very old and very silent film. It is a memorable story that is well acted and masterfully executed by director, Robert Wiene."
"""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" is upheld as one of cinema's greats, and in a number of regards, I can understand why. It is hauntingly beautiful and wonderfully stylised. It's Expressionistic cinematography is wonderful and suspenseful; it's no wonder that this film has influenced many subsequent directors and producers many years later.However, whilst it surely wouldn't have seemed like this back in 1920, it is rather boring through contemporary eyes. I'm sorry if this makes me sound ignorant, but today it plays rather slow-paced and un-scary, even compared to some of the other greats of Weimar cinema (such as ""Nosferatu"").Not a bad film by any means (I would recommend it), but ""Caligari"" seems more something of historical value and academic study to me."
"This 1920 film gets extra points for originality. A young man, Francis, tells a stranger an odd tale of a carnival man, Dr. Caligari, who comes to town to show the locals his ""somnambulist"", Cesare. Cesare has been asleep for twenty-five years and only comes awake on the command of Dr. Caligari. Cesare sleeps in a cabinet resembling a casket. During the show, Francis wakes the somnambulist. Cesare then answers questions from the audience and predicts the future. When Francis' best friend, Alan, asks jokingly how long he, Alan, will live, Cesare answers, ""The time is short. You die tomorrow."" Big joke -- except that Alan is stabbed dead during the night, just one of several mysterious murders that have taken place since Dr. Caligari and his infernal cabinet waltzed into town.I don't know how much I want to get into the plot itself. The ending isn't really predictable, so let's just say Francis manages to convince the police that Caligari and his somnambulist are responsible for the murders and there is a chase.However, the first thing one notices about the film is not the characters, all of whom overact according to the standards of silent movies -- and Cecil B. DeMille's sound movies.After Francis launches into his tale, what one notices are the sets. This is one cockeyed world that he and his friends inhabit. It's a cartoon world. These are all indoor sets that seem built of plywood. The backdrop is a complicated suggestion of a mountain with a village on its slopes, but it's sloppily drawn, like the rest of the decorations, as if by a child with a set of finger paints. The carousel at the fair spins at 45 degrees from plumb. What passes for streets, buildings, roofs, chimneys, and interiors are all drunkenly askew, leaning this way and that, each on its own trip and totally indifferent to the leanings of others. One might say there isn't a right angle in the joint. I've never seen anything like it.The characters, their dress and grooming, fit right into this insane landscape. When we are first introduced to Cesare, when Caligari opens the door of the upright casket, we're treated to a close up of Conrad Veidt's face with its black eye shadow and the thin glossy smear of what looks like paste across his thin lips. And when he opens his eyes, it's pretty spooky -- the equal of Karloff's monster when he first appears and slowly shuffles around toward the camera. Caligari himself is adorned with an unruly aura of white hair and thick, goggle-like eyeglasses. He wears white gloves with three thin black strips on the back, just like Mickey Mouse.It might be possible to argue that this is expressionism for expressionism's sake -- but that's not the case. The framing story takes place in sets that more closely resemble the world that you and I are familiar with. The Boschian garden of earthly delights in which most of the story takes place is as crazy as it is for a good reason, which I can't explain here.There's no other film quite like it. Expressionism been pretty influential over the years, but the dark shadows and crooked streets of most later films are only dry, dead leaf echoes of this original."
"I've always been a fan of Edward Scissorhands, but after watching this film, I realized where Tim Burton may have gotten the idea for his film. One of the great displays of German Expressionism, I especially felt the score (though added years later) was quite moody, bringing out all of the emotions one should experience in a film like this. The sets were so unusual, so strange, that the film felt more like a stage production coming to life on the screen. A milestone in film, and one which should be continued to examined even after all of these years."
"Saw this first in the mid 90s on a laser disc. Revisited it recently on a bluray.
Today's youngsters may dismiss it as another boring film but if u r a true fan of the crime/horror genre, then u owe it to urself to see this film. Like most silent films, it requires some patience.
It is truly the first horror movie (before Nosferatu).
The strange n mesmerising thing about this film is the angular buildings, pointy trees, winding staircases, taller chairs, etc.
I found this aspect strangely mesmerizing and surreal.
The aghast faces of the characters, especially the somnambulist, Cesare, were scary enuff for that era but the best part was the ending. This movie truly introduced the concept of the twist ending n the dreamlike imagery along with the twist messes with your mind.
Nolan, Lynch n Shyamalan must have been really inspired by Robert Wiene."
"World War One sent a shockwave through the arts and one of the results was expressionism. The term is difficult to define; in a general sense, however, it refers to a type of art that makes a statement about internal emotion and psychology. Often linked to surrealism and cubism, in the 1920s expressionism became one of the dominate styles in visual and performing arts and was particularly associated with Germany.The 1919 THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is perhaps the only film made in a purely expressionist style. As directed by Robert Wiene and designed by Herman Warm, Walter Reimann, and Walter Rohrig, everything about the film is exaggerated, off-center, and disorienting. The sets are strange, deliberately artificial constructions of flat surfaces in odd angles and broad strokes of paint; the make-up and costumes are equally exaggerated. The result is a unique look that has the paranoid essence of nightmare, and the story links with the visuals to remarkable effect.A carnival has come to a small German town, and among its attractions is Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) and ""sonambulist"" Cesare (Conrad Veidt). When awakened from his sleep, Cesarea makes predictions of the future--predictions of death! And through his power over the sleepwalker, Caligari ensures that the predictions come true. It is frequently described as the first true horror film. But while the story was shocking by 1919 standards, it was really the visual style of the film that outraged critics and the public alike; many described it as ""degenerate,"" and it proved extremely controversial where ever shown.It also proved incredibly influential--so much so that it is virtually impossible for any one serious about film as art to avoid it. But there are quite a few releases that you should avoid: the film is in public domain, and the result has been a series of DVD and VHS ""budget"" releases that are dire to the nth degree. It is a matter of getting what you pay for, and while the KINO release is the most expensive print available, it is also the only one worth having. The picture quality is as good as it can be short of digital restoration and the film has been restored to its original tints as well.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"This is the way movies should have always been done, right from the start until now.I first saw this film 1 year ago. I bought it on DVD based on recommendations of a respected A/V magazine, since they said it represented ""the best transfer to DVD from a B/W movie we have ever seen"". So I expected to calibrate my tv set with it, and to stash it with the other DVDs I never watch.But from the beginning, I was hooked. Why was everything so normal, then imagery became so... astounding? The first minutes of the film were crucial, since I really began to see that these movie was trying so hard to convey a meaning far beyond that of being an expressionist film. So I followed, and followed. And marveled at the weird angles, incredible set design, and at the story that was unfurling on screen. A feeling of nervousness began by the second half of the movie, since (I think) the sets had worked their magic on my imagination, and I was sucked deep into the movie. And when I thought the movie was over.... there was an ending any modern movie would love to achieve. Terrific!Watching the running commentary only made things even better, since every detail and nuisance was explained, tracing paralels with Germany of the 1920's, and exploring the motivation and inner workings of every character. What a movie!Highly recommended for late night viewing. Not a movie for watching with friends, though. This movie is like the finest of the fine wines: sip it alone, at your own pace, and you will find it well worth the price of admission."
"Because this somewhat weird, German-Expressionist film (with its original colour tinting) is now 94 years old, I really did try to be lenient and cut it some slack with my overall rating of it.But, with that said, I'm sorry to have to tell you ('cause I'm not going to lie), the best that I could ever possibly give as a score for this silent-era freak-show would only be a measly 3 stars, and that's all. Regardless of its old age, it just doesn't deserve more than that.For one thing, at 75 minutes, this picture was about 20 minutes too long. And, when it came to its rather bizarre and deliberately distorted set designs, I found them, before long, to be quite boring, and literally under-whelming.You can be sure, had this fantasy film been made in the USA (circa. 1920), I highly doubt that all the snobs-of-early-cinema would still be falling all over themselves with absolute, undying praise for it, right to this very day.From my point of view, this vintage film's story was so simple that it came across as being downright simple-minded in nature. And, as far as the Dr. Caligari character goes, he was far from being convincingly sinister and treacherous. On the contrary, this dumpy, old fart struck me as being nothing but a stupid, senile, windbag who couldn't even scare a child."
"As Francis (Friedrich Feher) sits on a garden bench with an older and skeptical man, a woman named Jane (Lil Dagover), wearing outlandish make-up, sleepwalks in a nightgown as she passes them. Francis explains that she is his fiancée and that they have suffered a great ordeal. This bizarre opening begins a flashback of Francis' story, which covers much of the movie. Francis recalls that he and his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), who have a friendly rivalry for Jane's affections, had planned on visiting the local town fair at Holstenwall, Germany. The painted set of the town hall shows all the buildings cramped together at odd angles with narrow passages, weird window shapes, peculiar furniture, uneven stairs, and gray and black shadows covering the white walls. To us these distorted images convey the madness of twisted brains that belong to a different ethos. Now an ominous-looking man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) seeks a permit from the town clerk to open a booth and present a somnambulist act at the fair (NOTE: somnambulism relates to sleepwalking, a disorder). Although the clerk harangues Dr. Caligari, he approves the permit. But the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed late that night. Then, at the fair, Francis, Alan, and Jane enter Dr. Caligari's tent. Caligari summons awake the ashen somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) after he has supposedly been sleeping for 25 years (!) in a cabinet which looks like a casket. Prompted by Caligari to ask Cesare a question, Alan says, ""How long do I have to live?"" ""Until dawn,"" responds Cesare, shocking Alan. Their fun over, the trio quickly depart. Just before the next day begins, Alan is seen through the shadows being murdered. Francis goes to the police with his suspicions that Dr. Caligari is behind the murders. At his wagon abode, Caligari tells the police that Cesare never leaves his cabinet without permission. The police soon pick up a common criminal who is about to knife an older woman. He is charged with the murders, even though he admits only to the attempted murder and not the previous two killings. As Francis and Jane continue to investigate Caligari, the doctor orders Cesare to kill Jane. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and as he attempts to murder her, she screams and faints. Obviously attracted to Jane physically, Cesare carries her away and leads the aroused townsfolk on a lengthy chase across a crooked trail. Finally placing Jane down, Cesare falls from a height to his death. The townsfolk go to Caligari's wagon only to find the doctor gone and a dummy in Cesare's cabinet.Francis travels to a nearby insane asylum to inquire whether Caligari might be an escaped patient. An employee tells Francis that he must personally see the director of the institute as he is not allowed to discuss patients. At the director's office it turns out that the director and Dr. Caligari are one and the same. So Francis is certain that he was correct all along: Caligari must be doing the killings, and he just happens to be a lunatic asylum director. Francis summons the police, who head to the director's office, which is temporarily unoccupied. Rummaging through the director's books, Francis discovers that in eighteenth century northern Italy there was a huckster named Caligari who had a hypnotized somnambulist that he trained to commit murder. As he kept the book, the asylum director must have liked what he read. When the director returns to his office he is confronted with the dead Cesare and goes berserk. He states he must become the new Caligari. The staff in the institute put him in a strait-jacket and he is confined in his own asylum. Here the narrative ends, but the story is not over.SPOILERS: There is a major twist at the end. Francis, now through telling his tale in the garden, goes to the courtyard of the asylum with the old man. Shapes are now normal, and the tilted walls of the next sets are at right angles. Both men see that Cesare is alive and stands in a corner of the yard. Jane, thinking that she is a noble, rejects Francis by telling him that he does not have royal blood. Dr. Caligari comes down the stairs, and when Francis accuses the doctor of being the killer and scuffles with him, the orderlies restrain Francis in a strait-jacket. The doctor says that he has a cure for Francis. IT WAS FRANCIS WHO WAS DERANGED ALL ALONG; HE MADE UP THE TALE! And Jane, Cesare, and the old man are all lunatics in the insane asylum! That is why the buildings and landscapes are all distorted! Pretty heavy stuff for 1919/1920!This Gothic murder plot of a crazed doctor ordering a somnambulist to kill is more complicated. The ending (and story) is open for more than one interpretation. For instance, who really killed Alan? Could it have been jealous Francis? The movie does not tell us. And could the asylum stand for the corruption of the world? The film seems to serve as an example of what happened to the German animus after the shocking defeat in World War I and the subsequent breakup of the former German Empire. Furthermore, the humiliating Versailles Treaty of 1919 that was imposed by the Allies was appalling to Germans (only President Wilson of the USA tried to moderate). Those are incorrect who equate this artsy film with the rise of Nazism; it is too early in its base history. Another element is that the director and screenwriters had intended to employ an entirely different ending, but had to change their thought processes as they conflicted with those of the German authorities. ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is captivating – one of the first horror films – and is a significant breakthrough in style and in German expressionism. It continues to mesmerize."
"I will spoil everything in this review, so if you haven't seen the film and wouldn't like to know something rather essential about the plot, please don't read further. I'm writing this in case, ironically, you haven't read so far and have ignored the spoiler tag.The new restoration of this film, seen through by the great people at Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung, will be shown at next year's Berlinale in February, and we know that the Masters of Cinema series will release it on Blu-ray. eventually Should a treat, since this film deserves such meticulous attention, and more. I'm not in the business to say which film does something first, and it hardly matters in my books. But ""Caligari"" most certainly is masterful in what it does, and in some ways it's still so modern and so revolutionary it's quite impossible not to be enthralled by it. I am talking about the infamous ""twist ending"", sure. But in an age where every story seems to implement a twist or two every five minutes, this term has lost its power to me to fully describe to full effect of what was done in this film. So, the film is framed as a story narrated by Francis, himself a central character in the story being told. The shock twist, of course, reveals to us that Francis, Jane and Cesare are actually mentally unstable and locked in an asylum. In other words, what we have seen is actually a fantasy and we realize that the narrator cannot be trusted.This is very brilliant, and one of the most powerful and successful explorations of the notion of the unreliable narrator in the twentieth century. But the film goes further. What I speak of now is the use of architecture. The most beautiful visual clue in the narrative is actually planted in what we see, in the wildly imaginative sets and production art. This is one example where its reputation as a German Expressionist film actually stands in the way of us being able to enjoy it for what it is – at least it did for me – since it's easy to write off the set design just as ""German Expressionist"". But the reason why the film world looks the way it does is because this is a fantasy, this is a world created by Francis, who sees the world differently from us, hence he's labelled insane. But the most shocking revelation that the end brings is that what we've witnessed is not only a tale of a madman, it's actually what we've seen that has been, in reality, a film seen through a madman's lens. And indeed, doesn't the whole world seem to be about to fall apart, the houses crumbling onto themselves? And isn't that the point?"
"German Expressionism in its most basic simplified term is "" Expressing in visual form what the artist is feeling and thinking "" It started in Germany at the start of the 20th Century and by 1920 found itself in cinema . THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI is one of the first German Expressionism films and remains one of the best , a fact reflected in the way it keeps slipping in and out of this site's top 250 movies The story itself is fairly simple to modern audiences but is far more complex than many movies from the period where directors still saw themselves as magicians rather than storytellers . It's not often that a film from these days has the type of ending seen here . What is typical for Expresionism is the set design which is bizarre and discordant . A fair come to town and a carousal spins in the background at a near impossible angle while the buildings are of a shape and jagged architecture that don't exist in any town you've seen in real lifeOne good thing about silent cinema ( The only good thing according to some critics ) is how easy it is to sell an non English film abroad . All that has to be done is swap the captions to a native language for the country showing it and then you've got something universal . Unconciously though CALIGARI remains an example of the German mentality of the time . Jewish film critic Siegfried Kracaucer brought forward the theory that Francis considers Dr Caligari to be a danger because he is an outsider and you can understand Kracaucer's line of thoughtUnfortunately one myth that has grown out of THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI is that it was the "" first horror film "" when in fact it's not . There is some dispute as to what was . Certainly I have seen a contender with the 1910 version of FRANKENSTEIN directed by J. Searle Dawley . It might have very metaphysical aspects to it but probably still qualifies as being under the horror genre"
"One of the most influential silent era films! It's dreamlike art style and atmosphere has influenced countless other films and directors(Tim Burton might be the most obvious example!). It also pioneers many tropes and elements that have become cliches in horror or mystery type movies. From the ""monster"" carrying the damsel in distress on rooftops to the prototypical super villain that is the eponymous Dr.! This was ahead of it's time in almost every aspect. And it has aged like a fine wine, getting better with age and showing even more how much it has contributed to the genre and movies as a whole.
Definitely one of the ""must see"" silent era movies!"
"In 1995, humankind celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birth of motion pictures; the newest medium of art proclaimed its reign of the world of art. Since its beginning, films thoroughly revolutionized the way people watch, think, and get entertained. Now, the time for us to mark a centenary of one of the earliest classics is on the verge. A timeless classic, visual perfection from the silent film period in the Weimar Republic, a century old Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) still mesmerizes the audience with its sensational visual and historical significance. The stylized sets and grotesque atmosphere of the film are remarkable as ever growing prestige and everlasting impact of the film makes it to an extraordinary level. Extreme distortions, jagged lines, discordant angles make the world of ""Caligari"" unusually bizarre place to live in. Anyone who watched ""Caligari"" at night, all alone, will say that ""Caligari"" is a creepy old movie with an eerie atmosphere and series of vivid imagery. To build a sense of psychological horror, production designer Walter Reimann utilized this unconventionally eccentric sets and disharmonious angles and lights to display the mental state of the protagonist. A critic at Variety claims that ""Robert Wiene has made perfect use of settings that squeeze and turn and adjust the eye and through the eye the mentality.""The film is recognized as one of the most important works from the post-World War I era. Veering away from conventional cinema and its methods, Expressionist movement in Germany, German Expressionism, sought a different approach to the cinema, exploring and expressing subjectivity through its images, acting, and lighting. A number of film experts believe that ""Caligari"" was one of the pioneers to both capture extreme imagery and tell subjective perception through rolling films, giving birth to Expressionist Cinema in Germany. In his book, A Critical History of German Film, Stephen Brockmann maintains that ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the quintessential example of German Expressionist cinema, was both popular with the public and acclaimed by critics."" The significance of ""Caligari"" lies not only in laying the groundwork of German Expressionist cinema but also in mirroring the society of Germany after the outrageous war. As mentioned above, sets and techniques used by Walter Reimann not only reflect the insanity of a character, but also communicate the tense anxiety in Germany after World War I. Through its theme, set, and story, ""Caligari"" works as a visual portrayal of German people's feelings toward the aftermath of WWI. In discussions of ""Caligari"", one controversial issue has been raised about the relationship between the film itself and the rise of Nazi. German film theorist and sociologist Siegfried Kracauer argues that the success and expansion of the film were a reflection of premonition of Hitler's rise. Kracauer's point is that the film, dealing extensively with the themes of control and obedience, has allegories that ""expressed German people's fear of chaos and a desire for order, even at the price of authoritarian rule"". Taking Kracauer's interpretation into consideration is useful because it sheds insight on the difficulty of envisioning the society during the Weimar era. Most film experts will tell you that you can see the elements of ""Caligari"" in the works of Tim Burton, Ridley Scott, Edward Lynch and many more. Indeed, ""Caligari"" was the cinema's first masterpiece."
"billed as ""the first true horror film"" by critic Roger Ebert, Das Cabinet is the first in the list of horror and Halloween-themed films i've watched this October to make me dread my own mortality, for the prospect that i might never view it again the settings are mesmerising and create the sense that you're looking at a feature-film-length stop motion Expressionist painting. if i'd known nothing about it and you'd presented it to me as early Tim Burton, whose stylised settings and character designs bear strong resemblance to German Expressionist cinema of the 1920s, i'd have believed you and credited it as by far his best work inspired by the screenwriters' experiences during World War I and subsequent mistrust of authority, with Dr. Caligari representing, in the words of Hans Janowitz, 'the authoritative power of an inhuman state gone mad', the story is compelling even without the political subtext: a psychiatrist obsessed with an 18th century Italian mystic (Caligari) tries to emulate him by using a pathological sleepwalker to terrorise a German town i highly recommend the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung's 4K restoration with hypnotic musical accompaniment by composer John Zorn that's sure to leave a lasting impression pairs well with Gorilla Glue #4"
"The film ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is a psychological thriller about a murderer who is on the loose in the town of Holstenwall. The strange thing is that all of these events started just around the time a magician by the name of Dr. Caligari comes into town with a magic trick that supposedly wakes up a man named Cesare from a death like sleep. This movie was very interesting and thought provoking, and they did a very nice job in tying in the social problems in Germany of that time. I felt this movie was not only an entertaining and mind-bending movie, but it also made you think to the point where you want to watch the movie all over again especially with the open ending. Most importantly I think this movie was made to be different than all the other movies that were coming out during the early 1900.One of the biggest reasons why I feel this movie is worth watching was the interestingly made plot and the journey that this story takes you on. One thing that drew me in from the second the movie started was the story, because it was incredibly interesting and very different. The idea that we experience and see a man's hallucination and what made him go crazy is something that interested me very much and it made for a very well done plot twist. The ending of this movie was perfect as it leaves it open for interpretation, and I feel that this was the only good way to end this movie. Another thing that I thought was very cool about this film is the set pieces. If you are a fan of the Tim Burton films and the way they look you will definitely appreciate this movie, because it definitely has that same look to it. The costumes were fine nothing too special, but I do think that the set was some nice eye candy. As for the camera work it was exactly what you would imagine for a 1900s movie.Lastly, I think this movie is worth watching because of the original idea it has for its time. The idea that we are watching a man's hallucination unfold is a great idea and it was absolutely mind-blowing at the time. One of the best and worst aspects of this movie is the complexity of the plot. It was a plus in the way that each act got better and better, however I did feel that the movie's first act went on for a bit too long and they could have cut five minutes off of just the first act. Every act did feel extremely different to me, almost as if they were three different films following the same characters, and this was mostly due to the weird transitions for each of the acts in this movie. This movie is a very interesting and well done movie, especially for its time. The movie did a very good job with making you think to the point where I had to watch the film all over again in order to absorb all of the information in it. The film did a good job with addressing the issues that Germany was having at the time in a very smart and organized way. The plot was interesting and the characters were good. The only thing I can honestly say that was bad about the movie is that the transitions to each of these acts were a little choppy and most of the first act of the movie could have been shortened."
"This is often regarded as one of the best horror movies and also as the first horror movie, many of the films elements have been rehashed throughout history, anything from the mad doctor who has control on a monster, to the twist ending. Its one of the most important films of all time, not only for horror cinema, but also for film in general and for Germany, Caligari represents the German authorities who control the mindless zombies at their will, in order to complete his dreadful deeds. At first this movie was booed by audiences, just goes to show that what is considered now as awful or bad may not be considered as such in the future, the movies flaws fall on its good aspects, this movie influenced so many other movies, that now it seems a bit tired to see this film, if you are not into silent movies, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you tolerate them or even like them you have probably seen this already."
"Back in the day when movies were new, you could film anything and people would watch it.Most movies you can speed up to 1.2x maybe 1.5x. This one was watchable at a whopping 3x-4x. You don't even have to be a fast reader! The actors pull faces and hardly move, which feels cartoonish. There are a couple of bits near the end where I slowed down to 2x but for the most part....Even at 4x speed not much happens.If you can't speed it up, prepare for a snore fest, a predictable plot and a twist that wasn't worth waiting for.The wacky cheaply made sets might pique your interest if you are into that sort of thing so I gave it an extra star for that."
"I respect this movie because it is in fact 86 years old. I love horror movies and although I love 70's and 80's horror best, I do like many of the older movies. This movie was one of the first real horror movies and is highly regarded in the genre.I recently watched it for the first time and had no idea of what to expect. It has very cool direction and I loved the sets of the movie. Overacting was a must in those movies to compensate for no sound, and I think the acting was superb. The overall story was boring to me, even 86 years ago I find it hard to believe this was considered creepy.If your like action and a bit of entertaining scenes when you watch a movie, then avoid this at all cost because its god awful boring. If you appreciate the classics and the art of film, then don't miss out on thisit's that simple 4 out of 10"
"The influence of this film simply cannot be over-stated. It is not only a picture that exemplifies German Expressionist cinema but it also arguably invented the horror film too. Sure, there were movies with horror elements before Caligari, but this is surely the one that formulated it into a full-length feature. Not only that but this is also where the art film began too. Films would simply never be the same again after The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.Of course the first thing that is immediately obvious is the bizarre visual aesthetic and bold set design. Everything is at uncomfortable angles. Trees and grass look like blades. Doors and windows are never symmetrical. Buildings are shaped in impossible angular styles. Everything is awash with extreme lighting, while the sets are painted with abstract and expressionistic designs. The crazed look of the film is of course meant to represent the insanity of the central character's mind. This must surely be the first time that cinema had tried to visually represent the subjective inner workings of a psychologically damaged mind. It also was pioneering in that the framing story where we meet the troubled protagonist also allowed for a flashback narrative and twist ending – both revolutionary ideas at the time.Needless to say that the film features extreme melodramatic acting that was prevalent at the time in the silent era. However, despite all this, Conrad Veidt is terrific as Casare the somnambulist. This is a character that remains very compelling to this day. His combination of darkness with a ballet dancer's graceful movements is one that will never get old. Cesare remains iconic and always will be. Which is something which can be said for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in general. This ancient film remains mysterious, evocative and bold. It's one of the most important films ever made and its dream-like ambiance is something that should be seen by anyone at all interested in the formation of cinema as an art form."
"As I write this, 83 years have passed since they shooting of The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari. Since then sound, and later color, has made it's entrance into the world of film, and most of the films from this era has long since slipped into obscurity.Not this one tough. Through the years it has gained a somewhat legendary reputation, somewhat thanks to Bauhaus and other arty bands and their heavy use of imagery from this movie to design single-sleeves, T-shirts etc. But of course the main reason that this and a handful of other early expressionist works from Germany continues to hold a tight grip over cineasts worldwide is that it's distinct style makes for a fascinating watch.Here the expressionist style is taken to extremes, and most of this early horror movie plays against a background of twisted and tortured buildings and labyrinthlike streets. Forget everything you've ever learn about perspective and realism: more than anything else, this quiet little town is a portrait of the human soul in an extreme condition. It is unsettling but also eerily beautiful.The story of the reappearance of the infamous Dr. Caligari (a medieval monk, hypnotizing his victims thus forcing them to carry out his will) in a nice and quiet sleepy german town is carried through well, and his somnambulist (and perhaps Dr. Caligari's tool of murder?) Cesare can be quite frightening. There is also a nice twist to the storyline right at the very end that gives new dimensions both to the plot and the movie in general. However, the main catch with this movie must be considered to be it's twisted imagery and innovative style.That is what have kept us coming now, for over 80 years.7/10"
"I still do not understand how this awful film is listed among gems like Der Golem, Sunrise, Pandora's Box, Metropolis, Greed, Broken Blossoms, The Wedding March or Intolerance. First of all it's a particularly ugly film which set was painted by ""artists"" who were fifteen years late on cubism and fauvism. Unlike DER GOLEM, SUNRISE or VAMPYR it has terribly dated. The story is similar than Faust but without any depth or magic. It's nowhere as creepy as Vampyr or Nosferatu. The score is unbearable and some of the acting is ludicrous. Most of the people who defend this unwatchable film are trying to explain we have to reconsider it was made a long time ago. I still bet than when it was made some people thought it was incredibly silly, ugly and pretentious. Cinema is Cinema and not a mix of theatre and painting, Griffith, Lang, Murnau, Dreyer and Abel Gance understood it unlike Robert Wiene."
"Spoilers herein.Most commentors remark on the `expressionist' sets and lighting. But these in fact were already common in contemporary stage productions, and just represented here as if they were stage sets. It is true that these have odd angles. But notice how the camera is always rectilinear: stationary, it shoots straight from eye level. That part isn't novel at all. The consciousness of the camera as a character comes from Eisenstein.But what is novel is the framing device which is the first example I know which plays with the veracity of the film's eye. And in THIS respect, the film is important. It is the progenitor of many experiments in folded, shifting narrative from `Rashomon' to `Mullholland Drive.'"
"With abstract set design of odd angles and shapes, Dr. Calligari is a very interesting looking film, but that's about all it has going for it. The unique set design is enough to engage your attention for 5 minutes or so, but for the other 65 you will be all too aware of how horribly weak the plot is. It is 70 minutes long, but feels double.I've read the film has underlying political commentary that was relevant to the time, but in my humble opinion, the best films are timeless, and can be enjoyed regardless of context. As I have little idea what the political situation was like in 1920 Germany, any commentary was lost on me, as it would to all modern viewers who have not studied history specific to that time. Therefore it has not aged well."
"Oh what a tangled web the world of the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is. It may all be sane in the focus of a madman, or it may just all take place in a crazy world. We see this story in the context of a guy telling a story to his friend or someone on a bench- following the sight of a 'spirit', perhaps, drifting by, a woman in a white dress who is in a complete daze. The story is that of what we would assume is Dr. Caligari, who in a town that could easily be called a geometrical nightmare (all those shapes and curves!), goes to a fair with his own exhibit: a Somnambulist, a person who has been asleep for quite a long time and is just about to be awoken. The question he's asked is right to the point, and the response is too: ""When will I die"" ""Tomorrow at dawn."" This is not just a cryptic message, we see, as people start to be killed by a mysterious murderer, brought on (or just directly because of) the doctor and his Somnambulust.This is basically the story, and it's a very good one, even a great one in its dimensions of a mad scientist and his quarry. And of course when we suddenly get that great big twist (or is it a twist?) at the end, it gives the rest of the film a whole other perspective to read into. But what you go to see the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is not for the story, per-say, but for its unique perspective as a work of cinema. Despite the imitations, and despite (or in spite) or those who would dare to be inspired by the work (Tim Burton springs to mind without a flinch), it stands tall as a mammoth work - surprising since it's only 70 minutes long - by creating its own view of humanity and the world, of the way a civilization and houses and roads and places can or should or would ever look, and giving its own characters a mood of dread and the Gothic. If you ever need to drag someone to show them how to get ""fantastical"" with a set, this is it.Robert Wiene, along with being a competent storyteller, is just a superb director of his actors in these sets. While it would be a little much for me to go on and on about how glorious the staging is within these seemingly un-navigable roads, and how the walls sometimes seem to be closing in or giving an extra edge that you only get in a nightmare, its important to note how well the actors come off here. It's because of them, as much as Wiene and his crew (Willy Hameister especially), that one will remember Dr. Caligari long after it ends. One such example is just seeing Conrad Veidt, as the somnambulist, awaken the first time in front of the audience - it's so chilling and gradual that it draws one in completely, and looking in Cesare's eyes becomes all the more frightening. In fact, it's hard to tell which actor gives off the more horrifying aura: the scientist (Krauss, with a great crazy head of hair and catalog of evil facial expressions) or Veidt's cool demeanor.Another scene I should mention, which is simply one of the greatest scenes ever filmed and should be seen by anyone with a pulse: it's when Cesare, after seeing Jane Olsen come into the doctor's place to try to find her father and the two make bizarre eye contact, drifts into her bedroom at night. There's the contrast of dark and light, white and black, for one thing to note, how staggering everything is lit and staged in this setting, and with the walls and windows off-kilter and deranged. Then there's the body language of Veidt as he comes up to the window and into the bedroom towards Dagover - it's seemingly supernatural, out of this world, but still in it, which gives it a whole other dimension. And then the shock of when she awakens, which gives the scene full-blown suspense and danger. I would watch this scene over and over, though it's not the only one that would continually fascinate.Cabinet of Dr. Caligari doesn't carry the same weight of its director's name as Murnau or Lang in German cinema (sadly, Wiene made only a handful of other films seen outside of his native country), but with one film and its standing in the expressionist movement (or, I would also add, surrealist to the degree of its importance in dream/nightmare cinema) it's just as important, and potent today. Watch it in the dark, and hopefully not alone."
"This wonderfully radical German Expressionist work from director Robert Wiene is unusually wordy for a silent film but then it has quite an intricate plot with a surprise ending. It is not just the story that is original; the stage sets are full of disorientating features such as unnatural angles and and weird shapes. The whole idea is to draw the viewer into the madness at the heart of the narrative. But this was a very political work: the all-controlling Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) represents the authoritarian figure that has so often dominated German politics, while the somnambulist Cesare (Conran Veldt) who blindly does the doctor's bidding - even when it involves murder - stands for the German populace that allowed itself to be marched into the Great War."
"I've seen expressionist films before, ""Nosferatu"" and ""Metropolis"" are ones that immediately come to mind, but this movie is probably the most perfect example. Not saying it's the best, but the most perfect example. If Expressionism is defined as a work that elicits emotion through extreme visuals, then you'll readily understand the connection. Director Robert Wiene, filming with a limited budget and a confined work space, used painted sets that are disorienting in a way that keeps the viewer off balance. Adding to this feeling are characters who walk into and out of them as if through some invisible gateway, since one can't define exactly where reality begins or ends. Additionally, angular surfaces require people to walk either slightly uphill or downhill, and rarely does the camera dissolve or open to the center of a frame, but more often from a corner of the screen. All of these effects create an unsettled feeling and distortion from reality.So there's that, but the story has even more going on, because almost nothing is as it appears to be. It begins with the title - if you really think about it, there was no 'real' Dr. Caligari to speak of, the character attributed to be Caligari was the director of an insane asylum who was influenced by, one would say obsessed with, the work of a predecessor from 1783 by that name, revealed in Act V of the movie. In turn, Caligari attempted to duplicate the work of his namesake in waiting for a patient to show up who was a somnambulist, a sleepwalker, the purpose of which was to learn if that person could be influenced to perform certain acts that would have been otherwise out of character. In other words, he would hypnotize his patient to perform criminal acts, including murder! The business with the second, red herring murderer was an interesting diversion for both the viewer and the characters in the story. With Francis (Friedrich Feher) maintaining his vigil over the Caligari caravan, he watches what he believes is the somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) asleep in his cabinet, (coffin?), but is it really Cesare? One can observe Francis slowly going mad as the 'body' in the cabinet turns out to be a puppet, and he's on hand at the asylum to witness Cesare returned as a patient, while Caligari is strait-jacketed and placed in a cell, never to be free again. Seeing the new director and believing him to be Caligari, Francis completes his mental breakdown as asylum workers have another strait jacket handy just for him.The brilliance of the film is probably more apparent if one re-watches it immediately after seeing it the first time. As the picture opens, Francis is speaking to an older man who states ""There are spirits. They are around us."", while Francis purports to tell him an even stranger tale. He holds to a belief that Jane (Lil Dagover), who passes into view as some ethereal specter, is his fiancé, though we learn at the end of the movie that she would not marry him because as a 'queen' - ""We who are of noble blood may not follow the wishes of our hearts"". The full circle aspect of what occurs in the story becomes evident when one realizes that Francis, Jane Olsen, and the older man, are all inmates of the asylum, and if you want to take it that far, are prisoners in the cabinet of Dr. Caligari as well."
"A devious hypnotist named Dr. Caligari arrives in town to promote his somnambulist in a wooden ""cabinet"" (basically a wooden casket) in the local fair, with a series of knife murders starting up as a result. Werner Krauss is the golem-faced Caligari while Conrad Veidt is his controlled victim (claimed by Caligari to have been in a twenty-three year slumber, only awakened for the fair), sent out at night to kill. I didn't realize this until I was reading some of the film's back story but the plot is related to the writers' aftermath in the military, using the Caligari character as a symbol for them while Conrad is a representation of themselves as soldiers manipulated into killing for their country. Anyway, when a local named Friedrich Feher is talking with an older man claiming spirits were responsible for ruining a life with his family, driving him apart from them. Feher claims that a methodically-walking woman moving past (Lil Dagovel) them is soon to be his wife. He proclaims that they have been through a lot and starts to tell the Caligari story. Where the three of them are actually located is a twist right out of a horror film.The film presents the village Feher lives in a visually askew style where the architectural structures, furniture, landscapes, and backdrops (distance shots of the city and mountains) aren't aligned or presented in a fashion we are accustomed to, angled and pointed in directions that describe what we see as off-kilter and irregular. The stylistics in the use of shadow (like the silhouette of a knife murder against a wall as it is being committed), and even how the makeup and eyeliner are used for the faces of the characters encourage this feeling that we are experiencing a world quite alien to our own. This is purposely surreal so that the twist (although against how the writers wanted to end their film) makes sense in the grand scheme of things. The painted sets and matte backgrounds correspond with the visually misshapenness of the village. It is not supposed to look and feel like a place that exists in our world, but the village is of another place entirely. The image of Dagovel, with her eyes totally devoid of life, walking past Feher in a trance, in her white gown is an instant grabber. Veidt's eyes opening for the first time, his slinky body dressed in black steadily leaving the cabinet, foretelling the doom of Feher's friend in a fair ""performance"" is another memorable scene. Krauss has a marvelous face for a silent horror/cult film. The way even the titles are designed in relation to the film's visual content (and there's this fab moment in the film when Krauss' thoughts are literally spelled out overhead to torment him) is extraordinary. Veidt standing over Dagovel's bed might just remind viewers of Nosferatu hovering over Menaboth are night sequences where the damsel is in bed at her most vulnerable. The whole insane asylum development and diary discovery sure take the film in a whole different direction in regards to Caligari. It is that fork in the road that the viewer takes along with the film that leads to an unexpected finale. The performances are very much heightened to match the presentation...so over-the-top as a description for this film seemed appropriate. And how the camera's eye opens and closes on characters to further emphasize where the story is going is a technique quite creative in how it tells its story.This is a silent film quite deserved of its rep, and the newly restored and meticulously ""repaired"" version that is certainly a patch over the public domain print is the best I've seen thus far. The differing color hues of alternating scenes, while unintentional by restorers, actually gives the film an extra otherworldy effect I wasn't expecting."
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920): Dir: Robert Wiene / Cast: Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, Friedrich Feher, Lil Dagover, Hans Heinrich von Twardowski: Intriguing silent film with cabinet symbolizing power or secret. Expressionistic film stars Werner Krauss as a hypnotist showcasing a somnambulist. When a series of murders occur the somnambulist is blamed. Highly influential and overly stylistic in terms of lighting and sets. Clever screenplay where everything is not as it seems with closing scenes that will have viewers admiring its sheer brilliance. Directed by Robert Wiene who establishes expressionistic filmmaking. Krauss plays the mysterious Dr. Caligari as a man with a scene that he will unleash at the fair. Conrad Veidt plays the eerie somnambulist whom Dr. Caligari unleashes. This zombie like character will terrorize and eventually abduct the girlfriend of the film's hero before the town people track him down. Friedrich Feher tells the story, and Lil Dagover plays his girlfriend whom assists in investigating Caligari until she is abducted. Hans Heinrich von Twardowski gets front row seats to the narration while both compete for the same woman. What is truly great about this silent film masterpiece is how nothing is what it seems. This film seems to have invented the ""twist ending."" Everyone appears as somewhat two-faced. It is a thrilling film that plays on the mind in more ways than one. Score: 10 / 10"
"Can you imagine that this German flick is almost 100 years old and still looks great. And I just watched it for the first time on Blu Ray in it's full glory. I mean, it's out there in so many ways and never in his full length. Yes you are all correct, it only misses a few frames but still, nowadays we can see it restored and even on Blu Ray it looked stunning.Even for people who like horror this still give you the creeps. The shots used, the make-up, the expressionism of course and the close-ups of faces. And don't forget the use of lighting to create shadows. And if you have seen this one you will know where Tim Burton got his ideas for making props. I won't go into the story but the acting is sublime even as it all looks over the top but hey, it's expressionism galore remember. And for the Goths still walking among us this is also a must see. Remember those gigs from Bauhaus? Well, just have a look at Cesare (Conrad Veidt) how he do his performance and go compare it with Peter Murphy.Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari is out there and from now on full uncut, restored and full of extra's on the Masters Of Cinema series, the best you can get for those old classics and a classic it is...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 5/5 Comedy 0/5"
"A young man named Francis (Friedrich Feher) recounts his horrifying past experience to an older man. At a fair he'd attended with his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), he'd watched a novelty act involving a somnambulist, or sleepwalker. The somnambulist is Cesare (Conrad Veidt), a strange looking man who makes eerie predictions. When Alan is killed, Francis takes an interest in shadowing Cesare, until he realizes the truth of the situation.While still a relative newcomer to what is referred to as ""German expressionism"", this viewer can say that this movement created, for him, some of the loveliest atmosphere and scares to be found in the genre. Director Robert Wiene and company capture on film a succession of incredible images. ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is beautiful to look at and plays like a painting come to life. Light, shadow, and use of colour tinting are all extremely impressive. This is the kind of old style horror film that could legitimately creep out its audience, whether it's in the wee hours of the morning or not. This viewer watched a version featuring a newly added music score that did add to the mood at times, and was merely distracting at others.The primary asset is an amazing performance by the young Veidt, also very well known for playing Strasser in ""Casablanca"" near the end of his life and career. Veidt plays a character who, while undeniably creepy, is not entirely unsympathetic. Cesare does soften when he beholds the beauty of Francis's love interest Jane (Lil Dagover). It's the diabolical Caligari himself (Werner Krauss) who is the true menace. And Krauss is delicious, in a decidedly theatrical turn.The action is divided into six acts, and finishes with a very fun twist ending.Essential viewing for not just horror buffs, but film buffs in general.Nine out of 10."
"(87%) A creepy, surreal, and very interesting oddity that could be argued marks the very beginning of the slasher horror sub genre; although this was made nearly one hundred years ago so don't expect any blood, frisky naked ""teenagers"", or detailed death scenes. This, truth be told, is something that really needs to be broken down and debated to get the most out of the more subtle and abstract themes and ideas. Throughout there are clear modern influences, most notably in many examples of Tim Burton's work, with its crooked trees, deathly pale characters, and warped buildings. Everyone with a fondness of classic cinema should watch this as it's as brilliantly unique as it is weirdly timeless."
"This film is great for a number of reasons. The cinematography stands out in a number of ways. This was during a point in film history known as German expressionism. Where films (especially German films like this) were known for their creepy cinematography. Twisted imagery, intriguing sets, and windows are anything but square. The plot is that a crazy mad scientist named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) is a mad scientist who has a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt) that tells people deadly predictions that come to life. Caligari and Cesare are suspected by the victim's friend Francis (Friedrich Feher) and Jane Olsen (Lil Dagover) as murderers. There are many stills in the movie that have become ingrained as part of movie history. The scene of Ceasre going up a staircase with his body spread over it. In the beginning of the film when Francis is talking with an elderly companion about Caligari is one of the earliest examples of frame story ever. This is really influential film to the horror genre. I recommend it."
"Nearly a full century old but still more astounding, overwhelming AND scarier than 99,9% of all the other horror movies that ever got released or ever will get released in the future. ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is widely – and righteously – considered to be the first true horror movie and will always remain a role model, a landmark and a masterpiece to everyone that is even remotely fascinated by the genre. The film embodies the pure brilliance of German Expressionism, with decors, lighting and photography that are simultaneously mesmerizing and nightmarish. The plot, countless times imitated but rarely ever equaled, narrates the macabre fable of a vigorous madman that uses a minion to commit horrible crimes for him. The impressively charismatic and naturally frightening Dr. Caligari passes by the town of Holstenwall during the annual fair and exhibits Cesare, his supposedly clairvoyant somnambulist – which is some kind of permanent sleepwalker. Cesare predicts that a spectator will only live until the next morning, so when his buddy Francis discovers his dead body at dawn, he's convinced that Dr. Caligari is responsible. While Francis attempts to get inside the Doctor's cabinet and investigate further, Cesare develops an interest for his beautiful fiancée Jane. Time for Dr. Caligari to flee, but when Francis pursues him he discovers Caligari's true identity as well as his fiendish intentions. This film is unsettling, disturbing and incredibly petrifying from start to finish and there are several aspects contributing to its immortal strength. The gloomy and depressing interbellum atmosphere, the extremely well-written screenplay (courtesy of Hans Janowitz), the haunting architecture as well as the different color shades and the dreamy musical guidance (the version I watched featured music by composer Rainer Viertelboeck). Last but certainly not least, there are the unforgettable and indescribably marvelous performances of both Werner Krauss (as the titular Dr.) and – especially – Conrad Veidt (as Cesare the somnambulist). With his performance, Werner Krauss single-handedly set the standards for cinematic mad scientists ever since, while the image of Conrad Veidt, with his dark eyes and penetrating stare, is still more fearsome killer in history. This is undoubtedly one of the most influential and fundamental movies ever accomplished and there's only one rating justified for a monument like this; an impeccable 10/10."
"Dr. Caligari and his sleepwalking fortune teller Cesare (Conrad Veidt) come to the local fair. This event coincides with a series of brutal murders. What, if anything, is the connection? Widely (and falsely) considered to be the first true horror film ever made, we have to give it credit for all that it inspired. From films of its day all the way to Tim Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", the German expressionist art movement put to film creates a strong impression in the stark black and white.The sets are what really make this film. Rather than being shot outside (apparently due to lack of budget), everything was done in the studio, and the sets were painted. Even the shadows are painted and not actual shadows. What will strike the audience is how much the use of uneven angles was used -- windows, doors, walls and more are all slanted. If nothing else, this really aids in making the film memorable.While I cannot rate it as highly as most do (I found it to drag a bit at times and could have used about five minutes of edits despite only being 71 minutes long), it really is a must see for anyone interested in the history of horror or film. Or German expressionism, I suppose.The writers were influenced by the films of Paul Wegener (""Student of Prague"" and ""The Golem""), which led them to not only make a horror film, but an expressionist film. What level of the art is the writers' doing and which part the director, I cannot say. (On a side note, the producers wanted Fritz Lang to direct... it is anyone's guess how this would have affected the picture. Lang, of course, is a bigger name in early film than Robert Wiene, who made his directing debut here.) Allegedly, the beginning and end had to be added because of some sort of political influence and concerns about defying authority. Historian Siegfried Kracauer said of this, ""A revolutionary film was thus turned into a conformist one."" The stories I read differ on this and I don't know what to believe. The important thing to keep in mind, though, is how greatly the film varies with or without the bookends.The film is silent and not all copies are of the highest quality, so be aware of that going in. If you know this, it is definitely worth checking out. This is one of the first classics, and truly a necessary film for anyone who thinks of themselves as a horror fan."
"A German Expressionist classic with warped sets, lots of shadows, and heavy makeup, this is one of the first modern horror films.It is also one of the first serious films with a ""twist"" ending. You never are really sure of what is going on, and you are soon caught up in trying to figure out who is committing the murders.Two men, Alan and Francis, are rivals for the same girl, Jane (Lil Dagover). After visiting a circus with Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) and his somnambulist Caesar (Conrad Veidt), Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) is murdered. Suspicion, of course, falls on the somnambulist. When the murderer comes to kill Jane, he takes her instead.After chasing the murderer, Francis (Friedrich Feher) ends up at an insane asylum, where he discovers the Caligari secret.But does he really discover what is going on?"
"In flashback, freaked-out Friedrich Feher (as Francis) tells the surrealistic story of when the carnival came to his small German town of Holstenwall. The fair's main attraction is weird Werner Krauss (as Dr. Caligari), who hawks his ""somnambulist"" (sleepwalker) act. The menacing Mr. Krauss ""awakens"" creepy Conrad Veidt (as Cesare) from a 25-year sleep, for the viewing pleasure of carnival attendees. Otherwise, Mr. Veidt is kept in a coffin-like cabinet, in Krauss' trailer.Mr. Feher attends the carnival show's ""awakening"" of Veidt with pal Heinz von Twardowski (as Alan). Krauss tells the crowd that the mysterious Veidt ""knows the past, and sees into the future."" So, Mr. von Twardowski asks, ""How long do I have to live?"" Veidt tells the him he dies at dawn! - and, sure enough, a shadowy figure murders the man.Feher thinks the somnambulist is the serial killer threatening the village (a town clerk was the first victim). But, some think Feher knifed his friend, a rival for the affections of dark beauty Lil Dagover (as Jane), but why would Feher kill the clerk? When a completely new killer is caught red-handed, it seems like everybody wants to get into the act ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is one of the most outstanding film productions of the silent era. The ""Art Direction / Set Direction"" - by Hermann Warm, Walter Röhrig, and Walter Reimann - so beautifully photographed and directed, should be counted among the best designed of any era. The film is inspirational.********** Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari. (2/26/20) Robert Wiene ~ Werner Krauss, Friedrich Feher, Conrad Veidt, Lil Dagover"
"· Dr. Caligari, and his fortune telling 23-year-old Somnambulist Caesar, makes an appearance at a fair in Holstenwall, Germany. A town clerk turns up dead, shortly after an encounter with the good doctor that left Caligari offended and upset. I felt as if the city clerk had it coming · Caesar, able to predict the past and future, foretells of the untimely death for a town fair patron in a crowd of paying Caligari spectators. The patron, Mr. Alan, is found dead the next morning. Caligari is immediately suspect· Dr. Caligari and Caesar are eventually found out but the townsfolk just can't seem to keep the good Dr. Caligari out of business· The evil does live on in the picture; the ending defies a conventional finish· This film might be difficult for some younger viewers that are used to having mind-numbing Hollywood drivel force fed to them. It's a film that requires you to work a little bit, as it is a silent film· I would like to believe that the set design was produced out of sheer ingenuity and creativity opposed to simply being due to a lack of money · Mise en Scene: The Godfather of horror movies, Caligari should be required viewing for any serious film students. Additionally, two viewings would be recommended for a full appreciation of this film's genius. For lack of a better word, this film is flat out creepy· I would compare the musical accompaniment to: Tiny daggers being jabbed into my heart and veins. The set, apparently created entirely in an indoor studio, is haunting and also has a sharp dagger like quality to it· Caligari and Caesar are truly frightening at all times. For that matter, every character in this film behaved in an otherworldly dead-like manner · Contrasting shadows, interwoven with light and dark colors add a horror element. The bizarre set construction and lighting creates an uncomfortable other dimensional aura which is a constant assault on viewer senses· Colored lens tinting is used to convey additional feelings of fear, sadness, and excitement. Iris in-and-outs are used to move between scenes· Caligari is a textbook example of various components that can be used to create individualistic and creative artistic outputs"
"Our every-day hero confides in a friend: he has witnessed the manic horrors of Dr. Caligari and his murderous creature, and the evil doctor's wrath is closing in on him...""Dr. Caligari""'s plot is quite minimalist, but it's visuals are breed of stylization so extreme that they have all but disappeared from modern cinema. The perverse geometry of the expressionist age kicked into full swing here and would only survive for a decade or more and in the work of many an ace film-maker (like fellow German Fritz Lang, who could carry the form to new heights of symbolism): Tim Burton owes his crazy Gothic style to Caligari's demented visuals.What distinguishes this film from those that emulated it is that not only was it the first to explore a new visual style, it also did so in a way relevant to its plot (one must see the film to fully appreciate this).A pioneering work, from an age where just about anything was possible in cinema."
"In practically every book, essay or article about the history of cinema, ""Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari"" (""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"") is definitely an obligatory stop, as its importance in the history of film-making is unquestionable. Born in the middle of the difficulties of post-WWI Germany, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" was part of an artistic movement known as ""German expressionism"", where highly symbolic and surrealistic imagery was used to create a highly theatrical and experimental form of film-making. The challenge of low-budgets and the poverty of the studios ended up creating a visually arresting experience that became the trademark of films like ""Der Golem"", ""Nosferatu"", and specially, this now legendary movie.It all begins as a young man named Francis (Friedrich Feher) begins to tell what he claims to be, is the strange experience he has ever lived. It all starts when he and his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich Von Twardowski) decide to go to the fair that has recently arrived to town. In the fair, they go to Dr. Caligari's (Werner Krauss) Sonambulist show, where the mysterious Doctor shows Cesare (Conrad Veidt), a man that has been asleep for years and has the ability to see the future. Excited, Alan asks the somnambulist how long he'll live, but Cesare answers that he won't see the next day. Terrified, Alan returns home, and soon the prophecy is fulfilled as he ends up as the next victim of the serial killer that has been haunting the town. As all clues point to Cesare, Francis decides to do his own investigation, but soon he'll discover what's the secret of the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. As probably the most representative of the ""German Expressionism"" movement, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" presents us a shockingly different interpretation of the world with its irregularly distorted set design and the highly artistic use of light and shadows, creating for the first a time a movie that defies reality by becoming probably the closest one can be to watching a moving painting. While the credit for this brilliant display of creativity is almost never given to director Robert Wiene (due mostly to his irregular career), he makes an truly efficient job directing this movie, as if he was destined to do it.The brainchild of Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, the nightmarish tale of Dr. Caligari is still one of the most inventive and influential story of mystery ever put on film. While the visuals are often the first thing that one notices in ""Caligari"", the screenplay is as influential (maybe even more) as the design, as the way the story is built (as a flashback), the thrilling climax and the even more surprising conclusion of the tale are now often imitated classics plot devices in suspense films. Francis' story of madness and horror revolves not only around the mystery of Caligari's actions, but also around the suspense of who will be the next victim of the unknown serial killer.""The Cabinet"" is really one of the best acted silent films ever made, with an effective cast that makes a considerably subtler performance than what was the norm in the highly theatrical days of silent movies. Friedrich Feher and Lil Dagover have the main roles, and really transmit the terror and the madness caused by Caligari and Cesare. However, the highlight of the film are of course Werner Krauss as Caligari himself, and the young Conrad Veidt as Cesare. Krauss delivers a terrific performance as the strange doctor, and Veidt shows the talent that would make him a star in the U.S. during the World War II. Overall an unforgettable cast in an unforgettable movie.As written above, the credit to this very influential film is often denied to Robert Wiene, whose apparently uneven career made him look ""unlikely"" to make this brilliant movie according to critics (when we compare his career to legendary directors like Lang or Murnau it's easy to make that statement), and many have been ""suggested"" to be the genius behind (From cinematographer Willy Hameister, to Fritz Lang) instead of Wiene. In fact, Wiene's bash has gone as far as it's often said that Wiene added the first and last scenes in order to please the government when in fact that addition was suggested by Lang himself.Probably nobody will ever know how exactly Robert Wiene achieved this marvelous movie, but what is know is that ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" went on to became the most important achievement of the ""German Expressionism"" movement and a movie that even now continues inspiring and influencing artists across the world. It's safe to say that the haunting nightmare of Cesare, will continue giving chills to many future generations, and few films can claim this achievement. 10/10. A brilliant masterpiece."
"Deranged Doctor Caligari and faithful somnambulist (sleepwalker), Cesare, wreak havoc in a small mountain village in Germany. Murders occur and the investigation leads towards the somnambulist, but is everything what it seems?This is a film that is able to convey so much without ever hearing the actors speak. Yes, the film is a silent film, with the only sound coming from the piano played throughout the entire film, but that is what helps make the film so great. It makes the film more eerie and in the end, thought provoking. The story is told through a flashback from the main character Francis, the story itself is short and to the point. Yet this film manages to still be an influence today.With a distorted set design that blends well with the inter titles, one gets an uneasy feeling while viewing the film, something isn't right...you can't pin-point it till the conclusion of the film reveals what really is happening. The style of the film influences many works of art today, from multiple horror films to music videos, such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Otherside"". The film has beautiful images that were created to distort the reality of the film, which makes it really stand out on it's own.Just when you think you've been able to solve everything, the final frame of the film makes you doubt your own answers. Creating debates for years and years as to what the audience had just seen. Caligari is one of the best German expressionist films, and is able to stand on it's own today. 86 years later and it still is able to shock and please the viewer. Caligari has stood the test of time is comes out on top.Known as the first ""horror"" film, it still manages to give the viewer the creeps. From the evil looking Caligara to the almost dead like somnambulist. Influencing film noir and horror, Caligari was years ahead of it's time. In the end, it's an art film. Everything about it is beautiful. The picture quality only enhances the viewer's experience in enjoying the film. I recommend Caligari to any film fan."
"This movie was shot between 1919 and 1920, a few decades since the motion picture camera was invented, and the Lumière brothers were in the middle of their experiments with it. At the time, cinema was being considered as a new way of making art, and yo make art you had to marry with a serie of ideas: ideology, aesthetics, cosmogony, etc. In these terms, this movie belongs to the German expressionism, which is reflected in the entire setup: from characters make up to the background of the set.Having an average murder-mystery plot, the movie can be defined as a painting with some action occurring in it. The whole scenario was displayed following the same criteria as in expressionist painting: all diagonal and curve lines, evading the straightness and the cardinal orientation of things, wicked perspectives and proportions. Even the more minimum detail was carefully considered to fulfill the aesthetics needs. The result couldn't have been better, considering that the only visual trick they could do was to shrink/enlarge the camera's diafragma. Think that this was before the concept of travelling was even developed.Concerning the plot, yet it's true that it isn't really the great thing and that many people now a days find it boring, I got to enjoy it, further than its aesthetical function (I even got to laugh in a couple of scenes), and I highly recommend it, as a good old piece of art from which many of today's film makers may take some good lessons on how to approach movies. I'm sure that if they got understand that, then there would be much lesser crappy movies than there are now a days."
"It is difficult to place this film into words, because it tends to defy description.  It is truly film as Expressionist art-while there is a plotline similar to modern monster movies, it has a strong theme of the evils of those in authority.  Even though a framing device was later added to the film to cut back on this theme, it actually makes it even stronger, because it forces the viewer to question everything the film presents.The film's world is unique, with tilted, abstract settings, gothic characters, and the brooding soundtrack.  Though the overuse of irises can be annoying, credit must be given for the fact that the filmmakers actually thought to come up with unique cinematography.  The image of Cesare awakening, his eyes slowly opening then suddenly bursting open with fright is quite chilling indeed.  Caligari himself is framed in many bizarre shots, giving him a commanding presence in the film.The haunting aspect of this film is the enigmatic characters.  While we are first presented with a typical monster movie, with the evil Caligari sending sleep walker Cesare to murder in the evening, we are thrown a curve when the story teller turns out to be a patient in an asylum, populated both by the film's female lead Jane and Cesare, who died in the plotline, with Caligari as the head doctor.  While this was added in later to make sure the movie did not ultimately rebel against authority (censorship still being strong in Germany at the time), this forces us to question-did the events we've been presented with truly happen?  If so, did they really happen the way we've been told?  Was it all the fantasy of a madman, or was there some truth to it?  Though Caligari claims at the end that he can cure the protagonist, we get the feeling that he may not have his best intentions at heart.It is a shame that many people will avoid this film due to its age and its status as a silent film.  I myself would have never heard of it had I not been enrolled in a college film course.  It probably would not do well up against films of today with a modern audience-many of my classmates were confused.  Though this film is confusing, that's the point-you have to mull this one over in your head and draw your own conclusions.  That is the true staying power of this film-it never quite leaves your mind."
"This film does for the eyes what punk did for the ears. Dr Caligari through one medium stimulates all the senses. The images are so overtly stimulating that one is either entranced or else is switched off. By literally transposing the essence of German Expressionism to frame every scene, one is aware of voyeurism at it's most intrusive. The ending is the best ever, since it forces one to watch the whole film again to try to reconcile truth from fantasy. No film in history can match the stimulus created by Wiene in this film. This is a start to finish meal for the eyes and brain."
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is based on a delusion of a madman. Whole film occurs in the studio, which is designed in an expressionistic way. There are roads that go up to the sky, chairs with no sitting places, buildings which combine with unrealistic angles Shooting the film outside the studio would have completely destroyed the film's atmosphere. It would have been weird to find out that a madman's delusion is just like our reality. Because he is not expected to perceive things in the same `normal' way like we do, shooting the film in the studio and creating the madman's own world was the only way to show the wickedness of his reality. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari uses costumes in a functional way as well. We see Dr. Caligari dressed in complete black colors and wearing an overcoat as if he is trying to inform us from the beginning that he is the villain of the movie. On the other hand Jane, Francis' love (narrator), who is symbolizing purity and grace in his mind, is always seen in white dresses. However, as the ending draws closer, when Dr. Caligari is seen sleeping in his bed, he is wearing a white costume. As he was regarded as an innocent doctor by most people, his outlook changes to white as well. At the same time the audience is implicitly warned that seeing a person dressed in white (acting innocently) does not mean that he/she is actually innocent.Also when Dr. Caligari comes to get a permit to exhibit at the fair he has a very bad posture. He is leaning downwards and he is in one corner of the scene. This makes us interpret that he is a sly person who is different from `normal' people. Lighting was one of the crucial points in Caligari. Because of the financial problems of Germany at that time, lights were painted. There were also lots of contrast in terms of black and white as if trying to make a clear-cut distinction between the good and the evil. When Cesare comes to kill Mr. Alan (Francis' friend), we see the murder from the shadows of both men. Also when Cesare is on his way to kill Jane, we see his shadow on the wall. As he is wearing a black costume as well, there seems to be no difference of himself from his shadow probably meaning that he is a part of the night with his diseased soul. However there's hardly any camera movement in the film.in Caligari there is hardly any movement. Everything is stage-like and different angles are not usually used in one scene. Close-ups are usually done by narrowing the iris. There was only one panning and it was in the police station when the wrong suspect was arrested. Camera made a slight pan movement in attempt to show the small crowd's faces. It seems that this movement does not hold an artistic importance in the film.While Caligari can be regarded as representing the complete authority of the government over its citizens, Cesare seems to represent the obeying people. In the film, Caligari says that Cesare has slept for 23 years meaning that people are made to do things and that they are not complaining while doing them. On the whole, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a masterful piece of German Expressionism which every cinema lover should see at least twice in his life."
"What can be said about this breathtaking film but that it is Art in its purest sense. The Cabinet, a sideshow act at a small German Town Fair, contains Cesare, a somnambulist or sleep-walker (this term had far more horrific connotations in 1919). He is under the care of the sinister seeming Dr. Caligari. Trouble starts when bodies start turning up, stabbed by an unknown assailant. The townfolk wait nervously for the next body to drop, suspicious of everything and everyone.This is all narrated to us by Friedrich Fehér, a student whose friend's death was foretold by the lurking somnambulist. He puts two and two together and goes to exact vengeance. Does he succeed? Well, I'm not going to tell you, go watch it and have a rip-roaring time.Though a lot of credit must go to the producer of this movie, Erich Pommer, the main attraction is the quality of the sets and costumes, designed by German Expressionists Hermann Warm, Walter Röhrig and Walter Reinmann. These dark, brooding designs push the film from a realistic recreation of life to a mystical new place where all is art and nothing matched this reviewer's humdrum imagination.A must."
"I was hesitant to view THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI for a long time for fear that I would be disappointed in it. Having seen METROPOLIS, NOSFERATU, and THE GOLEM, I sensed that CABINET would not stand up well to those, all classics of German cinema. Well, I was right, CABINET is not as good as any of those, but is still a very well-made film and is as stunning as it was in 1920.A man sitting in a park tells the story of Dr. Caligari and how he visited a small German village with the fair and terrorized the citizens of the city by sending out his somnambulist, Cesare, to kill people. As a German Expressionist work, CABINET delivers the goods when it comes to set design and plot. The set design for the film features flattened jagged buildings and weird angles galore. The plot, which isn't much, has a spectacular twist by the final 5 minutes and drives home the aura of insanity the movie contains.THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI does slow down to a crawl during the middle section of the film, but picks up during the final half is as breath-taking to look at the entire running time. Modern-day filmmakers should take a few hints from this film. I can only compare the work of Tim Burton to this film and even he is not as creative as CABINET. Recommended for those who are patient and appreciate the visual technique of filmmaking."
"one of the greatest films featuring german expressionism,  this film mixes a psychological theme with strange surrealist settings, an idea that has been copyed ever since.the lack of sound no way interfered with the story and it almost seemed impossible to not look at the set and it's edgey unproportioned and warped edges.a great psychological thriller from the past in a time when this kind of stuff was amazing and awe inspiring."
"Dr. Caligari has a stall at the village fair. His show involves a somnambulist, Cesare, who can predict people's futures. Meanwhile, people are being murdered in the village.A horror-thriller that largely created the genre. Clever plot that would have been quite revolutionary for its time. Good build-up of tension with some good sub-plots and a wicked twist towards the end.Being a silent movie, the performances are quite theatrical. Not over-dramatic, to the point of irritation, though. Expressive enough to convey thoughts and emotions without being farcical.Hard to call it perfect though. One or two plot developments are a bit odd and there seems to be too few intertitles for the amount of dialogue and non-physical plot development. This meant that some plot developments, including a few key ones, took me a while to figure out. Did stunt the momentum of the movie to a degree."
What a masterpiece this film is! I think I may have seen a bit of it when I was a kid but watching it in full was great. I loved the sets; they reminded me a lot of Alice in Wonderland. Good creepy movie for October.
"The motherlode. Distorted sets, varied coloring of film and a haunting, eerie atmosphere that pervades throughout lay the groundwork for a genre and others to follow."
"This Masterwork is the best silent movie i've ever saw. it should be made as an musical. cesare (Played by the young conrad veidt) also played in ""the man who laughs"""
"Since this is considered one of the first horror films ever made, it's no surprise that I enjoyed it. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari seems to have set the standard for how a horror film should look and feel. The plot was compelling and the acting was entertaining. Now I'm going to be a film geek for a moment: One of the best examples of German Expressionism I have seen."
"I had tried to watch a silent movie or two before, and didn't actually work out, but this time I think that officially my introduction to silent cinema was more than successful! It is one of the most beautiful depictions of emotional instabilities of human nature. To start with, for me, the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was one of the most unique films I watched in terms of originality and innovation considering the decade in which it was shot. I can spot a bunch of elements that I've seen in more recent movies, how strongly The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari affected other filmmakers - and not only - around the world. The impact it had upon the goth culture is gigantic. I remember how much I liked the dark, shadowy, oblique landscapes and backgrounds in films such as Coraline or the Nightmare Before Christmas. I was wondering how they came up with it, but it all makes sense now. I could just go on and on praising the light and how those sharp-pointed forms at the back create the best atmosphere ever. The plot twist in the very last 5', something that later directors simply seem to adore, indeed took me by surprise 'cause I was never expecting something like this in a 20's movie. For some reason I had taken for granted that the end would be all sugar coated and rosy but Robert Wiene had something else in mind. By the way, is it just me or has anyone realised that Dr. Caligari wears Mickey Mouse gloves? Or, is actually Mickey Mouse wearing Dr. Caligari gloves...?"
"A simple plot, but with a great execution, a gem every cinephile must discover, ""The Cabinet...¨ is among the best of the best, even for its time.One can easily perceive why it became a classic: not only for the superb visual style, with those surreal, curved decorates that give the feeling of being trapped in a nightmare, but also for its dark, engaging and suspenseful plot (highlight scenes are the kidnapping of one of the main characters, and the last 20 minutes). A psychological thriller, which even has its moments of horror, as it's normally considered to be the first of that genre, at least in full-length format, if we compare it with, for example, short films such as ""Frankenstein"" from 1910. The uses of colors, framing, lighting, makeup, shadows, are all perfectly executed in order to give life to a nightmarish atmosphere.It is also important to note that it has the honor to be the film that founded the German Expressionist Movement, which would give us other treasures such as Nosferatu, The Hands Of Orlac, and Metropolis.Superb are also the performances, especially Conrad Veidt as Cesare and Werner Krauss as his master the doctor, who are already very creepy not only by their physical appearance, but also because they imbue an aura of mystery.And last but not least, the final plot twist (being also the pioneer film in using this device) encourages debate, and (why not?) further viewings. This twist, if it was not enough, was used in some later and recent modern films, with more or less variations, but I have no doubt that in its time it shocked audiences.A truly amazing experience. And it is already among my favorite silent films."
"A unique vision, a dark journey into a twisted world.Even if the cinematography may seem slow or even archaic to today's audiences ""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" is as influential as its gets.By combining elements of romantic writings with expressionistic art this is a movie which really stands the test of time, anticipating movies of the likes as David Lnych.Even more so since it has been restored and digitally scanned to shine in 4k resolution with new soundtrack and toned images like it was originally intended."
"There's one mayor spoiler, but everyone already knows it anyway.Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is probably the first real horror film that set the bar, and had a large influence on later films. I can here say that the film might not be as scary as it was back in it's release, but it still stays creepy. City with it's oblique and curvy structures, shadows and sharp-pointed forms creates an eerie mood. The story is more of a murder mystery than a horror, where professor manipulates a somnambulist to commit murders. Cabinet is also remarkable for using a flashback in flashback. And that ending twist that is more powerful than M. Night Shyamalan could ever dream of creating. Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is easy to watch mostly because of it's astonishing expressionist style and on the edge of your seat story. Must see film for everyone. Especially those who are interested where their favorite horror film's roots lies."
"This review briefly discusses the film's ending, so don't read on if you don't want to know anything about it. I've been wanting to see ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" since I first read about it as a child (it may even have been in ""Famous Monsters of Filmland""). This past Friday night, I finally got the opportunity to see it in a crowded movie theater, and 'Caligari' did not disappoint. The sets were amazing, and reminded me how lack of money can sometimes be a spur to creativity. While I found Werner Krauss' acting as Caligari very broad, Conrad Veidt was amazing as the somnambulist, Cesare. I had only ever seen Veidt as a mature actor in his villain roles, as Major Strasser in ""Casablanca,"" and as the evil Grand Vizier in ""Thief of Baghdad. He was quite a compelling and graceful performer as well as being a beautiful young man. Did he really die at only age 50? What an untimely death.I heard that the studio powers-that-be had imposed 'Caligari's' ending (which was not that much of a surprise, given the film's beginning) but that got me thinking about other movies that had ""studio-imposed"" endings and sometimes those are better than the endings the filmmakers originally had in mind. For instance, I don't think the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" would be as good of a film without Kevin McCarthy's high-tension narration, which was part of the studio-imposed framing story. Some people also think Hitchcock's ""Suspicion"" is a better film due to the (studio-imposed) ending, though it makes the story that comes before the climax less ironic, it also makes it far more ambiguous. In the case of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" I don't think the ending in any way diminishes the power of the central story, which has the force of any nightmare. In some ways, the ending is brilliant because it shows how human beings incorporate real events and people from their lives into their dreams. It's like waking up from a dream and realizing that you have been dreaming. As for what the dream means, who can say? I believe it is a movie to be felt, not interpreted. See it, and let me know if you agree."
"I am not normally a fan of silent movies, but as a die-hard horror movie buff, I knew this was one I just had to see...and I am so glad that I did! This movie is creepy, atmospheric and the twist ending just took me completely by surprise. Not to mention that the music is beautifully dark and scary! I am in love. This has to be one of the best earliest horror movies of all time and I think everyone should give it a watch! I adore the way the camera angles so that we see glimpses of shadows; it is incredibly atmospheric throughout, as well as leaving audiences with a sense of maddening danger. Definitely a must see for fans of the horror genre or for those who simply appreciate good, classic cinema."
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a 1920 German film directed by Robert Wiene, written by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz, and starring Werner Krauss, Conrad Veidt, and Friedrich Feher - about a creepy old man and his freaky fair sideshow and the mysterious murders taking place during their presence. Direction: 2/2 Very strong direction. The director was very in control and thorough with his actors performances and setting the mood for the story. The sets are absolutely amazing, in a bizarre way. The colors, the shapes of the doors, buildings, windows, etc., the make-up, the behavior, was all so peculiar and well done. It definitely kept my attention. Acting: 2/2 Extremely dramatic. I would consider it too dramatic but I don't want to knock points off for different styles in different eras. It worked for this film, for sure. It was laughable at some points but it's a silent film so I understand that they had to be creative with communicating through their bodies. Dr. Caligari and Cesare were acted perfectly. They were so creepy and weird. They did a great job. Screen writing: 1/2 It's a silent film so really all I can do is comment on the story, rather than the dialog. The story itself was a trip. Creative, different, interesting. I really enjoyed this film. I was glad to find that it still spooked me despite being from a different time, from a different country, and honestly, because I just don't get spooked too easily. Definitely a fan of the story. I have to say though that if a movie constantly makes me think ""Why did you do that?? You should have ——"" then in my opinion, it could have been better. There were many times where the characters did things that were straight up stupid or just completely puzzling. Cinematography: 2/2 Good!! Gotta keep in mind that this was made during the very early years of cinema and the cinematography was either of their own invention or a technique borrowed from fellow film pioneers. Bechdel test: 0/1 Did not pass. The only female character was Francis's romantic interest and her only role was to be the prize and the dame in distress. Did I enjoy it? 1/1 I sure did! Definitely recommend it!Do I ever want or need to see it again? Yes, I would want to watch again. Do I ever want or need to include it in my own collection? Yes, I own it happily.8/10 Bye love you -Jessie Carlson"
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is among the greatest films of the silent era and one of the most influential films in the early years of the horror genre. This is due to a number of inspired elements.Firstly the highly expressive acting and excellent costume design. The film is able to effectively form an identity for each of the characters without the use of sound, and with limited screen time. This efficient character development is crucial to keeping the viewers invested in the film's excellent and mysterious plot.Secondly, and possibly most significantly, the set design and visual style. The sets are probably the quintessential example of the ""German Expressionist"" movement, and its use with the film is simply ingenious when put in context with the ending. The simple but highly effective use of different colour camera tints throughout the film also add to this film's individualistic style. The use of blue tints in night time scenes, pink tints in scenes with romantic undertones and so on is a brilliant example of the film makers taking advantage of every resource available to create atmosphere, tension and to convey character.Thirdly, the unbelievably effective story. I shall not spoil it here, but this film has one of the most legendary twist endings of all time. The genius of the ending is still powerful to this day and one can only imagine the impact it left on spellbound audiences in 1920. However the story prior to this twist is an effective mystery on its own. The films greatest strength in terms of its storytelling is how it is able to convey so much through its visuals. Be it through the actor's body language or the masterful set design, the film almost doesn't require the exposition provided by the title cards.In conclusion, I hold this film as a true gem of the silent era, and amongst the most important early horror films. Brilliant is an understatement."
"The films starts with a flashback of Francis telling us a series of strange events that involves crime and madness. Dr. Caligari shows itself as a strange man that presents a show in a fair: he manipulates Cesare, a sleepwalker. But then there's a turn in the story that involves a paradox: Caligari works as a director in a psychiatric hospital, so how could he be mad or be the guilty for the murderers? This is the climax point in the film. Francis with help of the doctors try to discover in some books and a diary of Dr. Caligari his secret and dark intentions. Dr. Caligari is a man of science and he is interested in hypnosis. But as is usual in horror films, he is obsessed and want to take his experiments to other level. To prove that hypnosis really works and that a person can manipulate other's mind through this method till the point that the hypnotized will make things that consciously wouldn't do, Caligari wants Cesare to commit crimes.When Francis discovers all this he is taken for a fool. But as black cinema, it is not so clear which person is good or bad and which one is sane or mad. At the end, all this flashback was just Francis' fantasy, because he is enclosed in the hospital with Jane and Cesare (other patients). The whole film could be interpreted as a critic to the German government for committing crimes through the domination of the German people. And this is what happened some years later in the Second World War."
